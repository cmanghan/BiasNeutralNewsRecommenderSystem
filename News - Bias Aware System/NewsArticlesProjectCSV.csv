1,Joe Biden has another big primary night wins 4 more states,WILL WEISSERT and LAURIE KELLMAN,Associated Press,0,https://apnews.com/1d5e5fb505a14ce37fd812211a9d9e8c,WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden decisively won Michigan’s Democratic presidential primary seizing a key battleground state that helped propel Bernie Sanders’ insurgent candidacy four years ago. The former vice president’s victory there as well as in Missouri Mississippi and Idaho dealt a serious blow to Sanders and substantially widened Biden’s path to the nomination.Biden again showed strength Tuesday with working-class voters and African Americans who are vital to winning the Democratic nomination.Sanders won North Dakota and awaited results from Washington state. Washington’s primary was too early to call and because all votes there are cast by mail or by dropping them off in a ballot box many ballots were marked for candidates who have since dropped out of the race.MORE ON ELECTION 2020– Disappointing results leave Sanders campaign at crossroads– AP VoteCast: Electability boosts Biden Sanders falls short– The Latest: Sanders wins North Dakota caucusesThe six-state contest Tuesday marked the first time voters weighed in on the primary since it effectively narrowed to a two-person race between Sanders and Biden. And the first four states on Tuesday went to Biden a dramatic reversal for a campaign that appeared on the brink of collapse just two weeks ago. Now it is Sanders whose candidacy was ascendant so recently who must contemplate a path forward.Addressing supporters in Philadelphia Biden noted that many had “declared that this candidacy was dead” only days ago but “now we’re very much alive.” He also asked Sanders supporters to back him going forward.“We need you we want you and there’s a place in our campaign for each of you. I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion” Biden said. “We share a common goal and together we’ll beat Donald Trump.”Full Coverage: Election 2020It marked a high point for the former vice president’s staff. They sipped beer and broke into an impromptu dance party after his speech which was held close to his Philadelphia headquarters.Even as the contours of the race came into shape however new uncertainty was sparked by fears of the spreading coronavirus. Both candidates abruptly canceled rallies in Ohio that were scheduled for Tuesday night. That set the stage for Biden’s remarks in Philadelphia while Sanders flew home to Vermont and didn’t plan to address the public.Sanders’ campaign also said all future events would be decided on a case-by-case basis given public health concerns while Biden called off a scheduled upcoming Florida stop. Still the former vice president said Tuesday night that he’d be announcing plans to combat the coronavirus later this week.The Democratic National Committee also said that Sunday’s debate between Sanders and Biden would be conducted without an audience.Among former White House hopefuls and leaders of powerful liberal groups however Biden’s momentum is now undeniable.Bradley Beychok president and co-founder of American Bridge 21st Century a liberal super PAC said his group “will be ALL IN to elect @JoeBiden as our next president.” The organization is spending millions of dollars trying to win over people who backed President Donald Trump in key states in 2016.Guy Cecil chairman of the flagship Democratic outside political organization Priorities USA tweeted: “The math is now clear. Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee for President and @prioritiesUSA is going to do everything we can to help him defeat Donald Trump in November.”There were other major warning signs for Sanders on Tuesday. He again struggled to win support from black voters. About 70% of Mississippi’s Democratic primary voters were African American and 86% of them supported Biden according to an AP VoteCast survey of the electorate.After Sanders upset Hillary Clinton in Michigan four years ago his loss there Tuesday was particularly sobering. It undermined his argument that he could appeal to working-class voters and that he could expand the electorate with new young voters.One of the few bright notes for Sanders was his strength among young voters but even that has a downside because they didn’t turn out enough to keep him competitive. Sanders won 72% of those under 30 in Missouri and 65% in Michigan according to AP VoteCast. The senator was also about even with Biden among voters ages 30 to 44.“There’s no sugarcoating it. Tonight’s a tough night” New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez one of Sanders’ highest-profile supporters said on Instagram. “Tonight’s a tough night for the movement overall. Tonight’s a tough night electorally.”Another top Sanders backer Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar tweeted: “Yes we are a family united in restoring our democracy and committed to defeating Trump but that doesn’t mean we should stop fighting for the candidate that best represents our policy priorities in this Primary.”According to an Associated Press analysis Biden had picked up at least 176 new delegates: 71 in Michigan 40 in Missouri 31 in Mississippi six in North Dakota 17 in Washington and 11 in Idaho on Tuesday. Sanders got 110: 51 in Michigan 23 in Missouri two in Mississippi nine in Idaho eight in North Dakota and 17 in Washington.Although six states voted Michigan with its 125 delegates got most of the attention. Trump won the state by only 10704 votes during the general election his closest margin of victory among Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Those states gave Trump the narrow edge in the 2016 Electoral College after Clinton won the popular vote.Sanders has vowed not to drop out regardless of Tuesday’s results and frequently railed against the “Democratic establishment” that he says has aligned against him.In addition to the powerful groups now siding with Biden the former vice president has picked up the endorsements of many of his former presidential rivals including Sen. Kamala Harris Sen. Cory Booker and as of Tuesday entrepreneur Andrew Yang. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer sometimes mentioned as a possible vice presidential choice also endorsed Biden and campaigned with him ahead of Tuesday’s primary.Biden also gave a nod to all his former competitors saying “We’re bringing this party together.”“That’s what we have to do” he said.Not every Democrat was lining up behind Biden though. Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell who represents a sprawling district from the college town of Ann Arbor to the Detroit suburbs said Tuesday that she’s staying neutral.“I remember what it was like four years ago and the vitriol and the anger the people mad at each other the whole election cycle. We can’t afford that” Dingell said. “It’s about getting out and voting in November.”Like Sanders Biden has no public events scheduled for Wednesday. And though he’s celebrating a growing delegate lead he’s still confronting voters who question his positions which include a gun control plan that reinstates an assault weapons ban and includes a voluntary buyback program for assault weapons.That issue was at the center of a testy exchange with a worker while Biden was rallying earlier Tuesday in Detroit. The man accused him of “actively trying to end our Second Amendment right.” Biden shot back “You’re full of shit” but went on to say that while he supports the Second Amendment “Do you need 100 rounds?”___Associated Press writers Mike Householder in Detroit and Seth Borenstein in Washington contributed to this report.___Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast “Ground Game.”
2,The Latest: Sanders wins North Dakota caucuses,,Associated Press,0,https://apnews.com/1fb4ebe120cca2d5f93305f5425de023,DETROIT (AP) — The Latest on the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries (all times local):7:55 a.m.Bernie Sanders has won North Dakota’s Democratic presidential caucuses.Participation in Tuesday’s contest was expected to be dramatically higher than it was four years ago. That’s mainly due to a procedural change that makes the caucuses function more like a traditional election with citizens able to drop in at 14 caucus sites to cast their ballot and leave.Sanders won the state’s Democratic caucuses over Hillary Clinton in 2016 by nearly 40 percentage points. The race between Joe Biden and Sanders was upended by the former vice president’s Super Tuesday turnaround.But neither campaign focused closely on North Dakota. The state offers 14 pledged delegates.Biden won primaries in Michigan Mississippi Missouri and Idaho on Tuesday.___1:01 a.m.Joe Biden has won Idaho’s Democratic presidential primary. The state has 20 pledged delegates at stake.Democrats in Idaho are using a primary for the first time. They used a caucus in 2016 to pick Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nominee.Officials have said switching to a Democratic primary this year from a caucus could significantly increase the number of participants and play a role in the outcome.President Donald Trump is expected to have little difficulty winning the state in the November general election.Idaho last year was the nation’s fastest-growing state with close to 37000 new residents boosting its population to nearly 1.8 million. That’s a 2.1% population increase.Biden also won primaries Tuesday in Michigan Missouri and Minnesota.___11:35 p.m.The Democratic presidential primary in Washington state is too early to call.All votes in Washington state are cast by mail or by dropping them off in a ballot box and the state counts a significant amount on the day of the election.But once that first update is released election officials only provide an update once a day until all the late-arriving ballots are counted.In the first batch of results released late Tuesday night Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden are essentially tied — with each claiming about 33% of the roughly 1 million counted votes.Most counties in Washington state will next provide an update about their results Wednesday.___11 p.m.Joe Biden is celebrating victories in Democratic presidential primaries in Mississippi Missouri and especially the general election battleground of Michigan.During an appearance near his Philadelphia campaign headquarters the former vice president called Tuesday’s vote “another good night” and “a step closer to restoring decency dignity and honor to the White House.”In a subdued tone Biden reached out to supporters of struggling rival Bernie Sanders thanking the Vermont senator and his following “for their tireless energy and their passion” and their common goal: to “beat Donald Trump.”Biden reminded his supporters — and a national television audience — of the former rivals who have endorsed him more recently California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker saying: “We’re bringing this party together. That’s what we have to do.”___10:50 p.m.Joe Biden says the coronavirus crisis is “a matter of presidential leadership” and he’ll soon propose a plan to combat it.The former vice president spoke after he won Democratic primaries in Michigan Missouri and Mississippi on Tuesday dealing a serious blow to Bernie Sanders.But Biden opened his victory speech with an acknowledgement of the worldwide crisis that has prompted travel bans quarantines and emptied college campuses. He said “This whole coronavirus issue is a matter of presidential leadership and later this week I’ll be speaking to you on what I believe the nation should be doing to address this virus.”The outbreak is disrupting the Democratic primary too. Both Biden and Sanders cancelled rallies Tuesday night. And the Democratic National Committee says their next debate Sunday in Arizona will not have a live audience.___9:50 p.m.Tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang is backing Joe Biden’s presidential bid saying it’s time for Democrats to rally around the former vice president and get ready for the general election.Following Biden’s projected wins in a number of state primaries Tuesday Yang said on CNN that he sees Biden as the best-positioned candidate to defeat President Donald Trump in November saying Democrats need to “come together as a party starting tonight.”A supporter of Bernie Sanders in 2016 Yang said the Vermont senator inspired his own presidential run which Yang ended in February before signing on as a CNN political commentator.Yang said he believes the progressive ideas expressed by candidates like Sanders Elizabeth Warren and himself “will have a voice in the Biden administration to start solving these problems.”___9:25 p.m.The Associated Press declared Joe Biden the winner of Michigan’s Democratic presidential primary Tuesday using a combination of early vote returns and its AP VoteCast survey of voters in the state.Michigan stretches across two time zones which means there’s an hour in which officials in most of the state are counting votes as a few counties in the state’s Upper Peninsula are still casting ballots.The AP called the race just a few minutes after polls closed at 9 p.m. ET in Michigan after that first hour of results showed Biden ahead of Bernie Sanders. Those early returns also matched the results of AP VoteCast the news agency’s wide-ranging survey of the American electorate.VoteCast showed Biden holding a solid lead over Bernie Sanders in Michigan’s Democratic primary. The poll showed Biden winning among men and women as well as white voters and African Americans. More Democratic primary voters thought he rather than Sanders is more likely to beat Donald Trump come November.AP VoteCast is conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press and Fox News.___9:05 p.m.Joe Biden has won Michigan’s Democratic presidential primary.Michigan was the largest of the six states voting Tuesday with 125 pledged delegates at stake.Biden emphasized the Obama administration’s bailout of the auto industry which saved thousands of jobs.

The news agency did so based on results from AP VoteCast its wide-ranging survey of the American electorate. That election research captures the views of voters on whom they vote for and why.The VoteCast survey showed Biden with a wide lead in both states. Importantly Biden was leading in all parts of both states. He led among both men and women as well as among both white voters and African American voters.Black voters have powered Biden to wins in several states to date in the Democratic primaries including his touchstone victory in South Carolina late last month.In both Mississippi and Missouri on Tuesday Biden dominated among African Americans — winning the support of close to three-quarters of African Americans in both states.Democratic primary voters in Missouri and Mississippi were more likely to think Biden rather than Sanders could defeat Donald Trump in November.AP VoteCast is conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press and Fox News.___8 p.m.Joe Biden has won the Democratic presidential primaries in Missouri and Mississippi.Missouri has 68 delegates at stake.

3,AP VoteCast: Electability boosts Biden Sanders falls short,JOSH BOAK and HANNAH FINGERHUT,Associated Press,0,https://apnews.com/7e58879271d3d6b6494df7d8a27852f6,WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden went into Tuesday’s primaries riding a wave of voter confidence about his chances of victory in November — and that propelled him to wins in Michigan Missouri and Mississippi.Democratic primary voters in those states were more likely to think the former vice president could defeat President Donald Trump in the general election compared with Biden’s top rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders according to AP VoteCast surveys of voters.The Associated Press also called Biden the winner in Idaho.The surveys showed Biden built a coalition that crossed the spectrum of Democrats. African Americans and older voters continued to be a reliable foundation of support for Biden. He also drew support from blue-collar workers rural voters city dwellers women the highly educated moderates conservatives and even the “somewhat liberal” according to AP VoteCast.Sanders meanwhile preserved his strength with voters younger than 30 and those who consider themselves “very liberal.” But he failed in his push to drive up turnout among those groups and couldn’t overcome the concerns of moderate and conservative Democrats who are focused first and foremost on expelling Trump from the White House.AP VoteCast surveys are designed to capture voters’ views regardless of when or how they voted accounting for the many voters in Michigan and other states who voted early. Here’s a look at voters’ opinions as they cast their ballots in half of the six contests on Tuesday.ELECTABILITYVoters generally view Biden as the better match against Trump. About 80% in Michigan and Missouri believe Biden could beat the incumbent while roughly 90% in Mississippi feel that way. Just about 60% of voters in each state think Sanders would be likely to defeat the incumbent president.Still there is some notable indecision among primary voters about whom they’ll cast a ballot for in November. Roughly 80% in each state say they will definitely vote for the Democratic candidate against Trump no matter who is nominated. But close to 20% say their decision depends on which candidate becomes the nominee.In Michigan a state that flipped Republican in 2016 those undecided voters looked more like potential Trump voters than liberals unhappy with the prospect of a Biden nomination. Among voters saying their November decision depends on the nominee about 2 in 10 describe themselves as conservative and roughly half say they are moderate. That’s largely true in Republican-leaning Missouri as well.WHO IS VOTING?In the Democratic presidential contests it’s all about what women want.About 60% of Democratic primary voters in Michigan Missouri Mississippi were women. This fits a pattern in most states where a firm majority of voters are women. This has helped boost Biden who has beating Sanders among women voters.Other key Democratic demographics showed up for Biden on Tuesday. In Mississippi about 70% of voters were African American and Biden won 86% of their votes compared with Sanders’ 11%. About 70% of Mississippi voters described themselves as moderate or conservative another base of Biden support.THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESSSanders still gets love from voters under 30 but he has not delivered on his strategy of getting them to the polls.He won 72% of this group in Missouri and 65% in Michigan. But the under-30 crowd was just 14% of voters in Missouri and 13% in Michigan — about the same share as in previous primaries contests. In other bad news for Sanders he showed no particular strength with voters age 30 to 44 typically a larger share of the vote than the very young.In all three states older voters dominated. At least 60% of voters were 45 and older a group Biden has won over handily.BLUE COLLAR LOYALTIESBoth Biden and Sanders have claimed to be the working-class candidate. On Tuesday Biden assembled a coalition that could back him up.About 60% of voters in Missouri and Michigan don’t have a college degree and Biden won about 60% of their votes in both states. At least 40% of voters earn less than $50000; Biden won a majority of their votes.Biden’s strength among voters without a college degree crossed race and gender suburbs and cities. Only young people defied the trend. Sanders appeared to beat Biden with voters under 45 who don’t have a college degree.YOU SAY YOU WANT A REVOLUTIONVoters in New Hampshire and Iowa wanted to change the U.S. political system. That turned out to be an outlier as the nomination battle spread to other states.In the opening two contests about two-thirds of voters wanted a Democratic nominee who would transform the government compared with roughly a third who would rather return to a time before Trump. But as Biden climbed to the pole position the answers to this question have shifted. Voters on Tuesday were about evenly split on the question of change versus restoration or even leaned more toward a restoration of the way things were as in Mississippi.WHERE IS THE ENTHUSIASM?Even if Democratic primary voters like their odds in November enthusiasm isn’t overwhelming. Just about half of voters in Michigan and Missouri and roughly two-thirds in Mississippi say they are very enthusiastic about the candidate they are supporting in the primary. In all three states roughly a third are somewhat enthusiastic. As many as 1 in 10 expressed little to no enthusiasm.In Missouri and Michigan Sanders’ supporters are more enthusiastic than Biden’s. About two-thirds of Sanders’ voters said they were very enthusiastic about supporting their candidate compared with about half of Biden’s supporters saying the same.TOP ISSUESDespite fears that the coronavirus could stop the longest economic expansion in U.S. history there does not yet appear to be a spike in voters’ concern about the economy. Just about 1 in 10 voters in Missouri said the economy was the most important. Only 17% in Michigan described the economy and jobs as most critical roughly comparable to the share saying that of climate change.In Mississippi where a majority of voters were African American about a quarter viewed the economy as the top issue. That’s about the same share as in Alabama which voted last week.Health care was the top issue for voters in all three states as it has been in other Democratic presidential contests. Close to half of voters in Missouri and about 40% of voters in Michigan and Mississippi name health care the top priority.UNFAIR ECONOMYStill economic inequality is a key concern for Democrats.Roughly three-quarters of voters in each state consider the economic system in this country to be unfair similar to Democratic voters in contests earlier this year. Many — a third or more — call the system “very unfair.”About a quarter of voters said they were “falling behind” financially while majorities felt they were holding steady. Roughly half of voters in Michigan and about 60% of voters in Missouri and Mississippi who are “falling behind” called the system highly unfair.____AP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago for The Associated Press and Fox News.

4,Disappointing results leave Sanders campaign at crossroads,STEVE PEOPLES,Associated Press,0,https://apnews.com/950629c702d5b089c1209dec5ff3874b,PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Bernie Sanders has a choice.The face of the Democrats’ far-left flank is suddenly staring up at a towering wall of opposition from his own party an urgent call to unify against President Donald Trump and a growing delegate disadvantage.And as unlikely as it may seem less than two weeks after losing his front-runner status Sanders is now being forced to consider whether he will continue his increasingly uphill fight for the Democratic Party’s 2020 presidential nomination.The Vermont senator did not publicly address his supporters Tuesday night after suffering a devastating primary defeat in Michigan and decisive losses in Missouri and Mississippi. He was instead hunkered down at home in Vermont after being forced to cancel a rally in Cleveland because of concerns over the new coronavirus.MORE ELECTION COVERAGE– Biden wins hard-fought Michigan deals major blow to Sanders– 2020 primary takeaways: Joe Biden's nomination to lose– AP VoteCast: Electability boosts Biden Sanders falls shortAt the same time chief rival Joe Biden celebrated in Philadelphia surrounded by giddy campaign staff sipping beer. In his victory speech he invited his rivals even Sanders’ supporters to join his coalition.“This campaign is taking off” Biden declared. After the speech dozens of staffers broke into an impromptu dance party.The Biden and Sanders campaigns may be going in opposite directions but a Sanders exit in the coming days would be a surprise. The 78-year-old democratic socialist is nothing if not willing to take on the political establishment against all odds. Four years ago under similar pressure in a primary match-up against Hillary Clinton Sanders fought on for months before ultimately backing Clinton in July.Full Coverage: Election 2020The Democrats’ desperate desire to defeat Trump may change his calculus in 2020 however. Should Sanders get out soon he could save Democrats months of a messy and expensive primary fight. But an early departure would also deprive the Democrats’ most passionate supporters including many young people of the one man who embodies the dramatic change they crave. And there is reason to question whether they would rally behind Biden.As the former vice president’s confidence surged leading Sanders allies acknowledged that his campaign was facing an existential threat.“Bernie Sanders has a mandate not to abandon the movement. He needs to stay in this race no matter what” said RoseAnn DeMoro former executive director of National Nurses United and a Sanders confidant. “Heroes aren’t made they’re cornered. He is cornered.”Sanders’ most prominent ally in Congress New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez couldn’t hide her disappointment.“There’s no sugarcoating it. Tonight’s a tough night” she said in an Instagram live post. “Tonight’s a tough night for the movement overall. Tonight’s a tough night electorally.”There was concern even before polls closed Tuesday night. Sensing disaster the Progressive Change Campaign Committee issued an afternoon statement calling for Sanders to not drop out — or at least not before this Sunday’s debate.“To defeat Trump our nominee must prove that they can go the distance and that means no quick Biden coronation” PCCC spokeswoman Maria Langholz said. “Win or lose tonight Bernie should stay in the race until the March 15th debate at the earliest.”Yet Sanders was increasingly isolated in his party facing a primary calendar that will get no easier next week as four more states vote. None of them is bigger than Florida which Sanders’ team has long worried about privately.The three-term senator earned his first congressional endorsement in nearly three weeks on Tuesday. Biden by comparison has earned nearly 50 congressional endorsements in the last 11 days.And beyond elected officials the party’s infrastructure began lining up behind Biden in a more formal way in the wake of his second consecutive strong Tuesday.The head of the most powerful super PAC in Democratic politics Priorities USA pledged allegiance to Biden as the scope of his latest victory set in.“The math is now clear. Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee for president” tweeted Priorities Chairman Guy Cecil vowing that his organization would do “everything we can to help him defeat Donald Trump in November.”He added: “I hope others will join us in the fight.”___Catch up on the 2020 election campaign with AP experts on our weekly politics podcast “Ground Game.”
5,020 primary takeaways: Joe Biden’s nomination to lose,BILL BARROW and JOSH BOAK,Associated Press,0,https://apnews.com/fcf67466680a0a048a1d52da6f098ed7,WASHINGTON (AP) — Joe Biden’s path to the Democratic presidential nomination widened significantly Tuesday with commanding victories in Mississippi Missouri and Michigan a state that his rival Bernie Sanders won four years ago. Key takeaways:IT’S BIDEN’S NOMINATION TO LOSEBiden has become the reliable Buick of this race.His momentum accelerated as he broadened his delegate lead over Sanders with a series of decisive victories. The former vice president’s solid win in Michigan came in a state Sanders was depending on both to bolster his case going forward and for the practical delegate math involved. He came into the day about 96 delegates behind Biden and Michigan was his best shot at preventing that lead from getting any wider. (Democrats require 1991 delegates for nomination.)MORE ELECTION COVERAGE– Biden wins hard-fought Michigan deals major blow to Sanders– AP VoteCast: Electability boosts Biden Sanders falls short– AP VoteCast: Missouri voters say health care is top issueAs it is Sanders lost a big state where his upset of Hillary Clinton four years ago gave him reason to continue his presidential bid through the end the nominating calendar in June. This time the first round of voting after Super Tuesday ended the same way as last week’s surprise outcome: with a Biden celebration and an increasingly steep climb for Sanders.Biden isn’t just leaning on his base of African Americans. AP VoteCast surveys in Michigan and Missouri also show he topped Sanders in suburbs and notably across small-town and rural counties where Sanders had led Clinton in 2016.“We need you we want you and there’s a place in our campaign for each of you” Biden said Tuesday night. “I want to thank Bernie Sanders and his supporters for their tireless energy and their passion. We share a common goal and together we’ll beat Donald Trump.”Sanders’ bad March can be explained this way: Biden’s net delegate gains out of Alabama last week and Mississippi on Tuesday — two Republican-dominated states — essentially cancel out the delegate advantage that Sanders pulled out of California which has the largest delegate trove.DOES BERNIE HAVE A PATH OR A PROTEST?Sanders stayed in the race until June four years ago fueled in no small part by his Michigan primary victory. This time the path going forward looks much different.The Vermont senator faces a fraught choice. Does he try something new: going after Biden even more aggressively as an establishment figure a relative foreign policy hawk a budget centrist who threatens Social Security? There’s little evidence over the last two weeks that any of that would change the fundamentals of the contest.Full Coverage: Election 2020Another option: Sanders can continue advocating for the issues that his supporters hold dear like “Medicare for All” and free college not explicitly ceding the nomination but using his base to pressure a Biden-led party to move as far left as possible.He was back at his home in Vermont Tuesday night.BLACK VOTE AGAIN PROVES UNATTAINABLE FOR SANDERSIt can’t be emphasized enough. Black voters are as crucial for picking Democratic nominees as any demographic in the party’s coalition.And Sanders just can’t get over the hump. It happened again in Mississippi on Tuesday just like Southern Super Tuesday states last week and South Carolina before that. According to AP VoteCast about 70% of Mississippi’s Democratic primary voters were African American; 86% of them supported Biden.The reality remains: Sanders has not made enough inroads in that critical Democratic constituency to have a clear path to becoming the nominee.BIDEN HAS AN EDGE ON SANDERS’ BIGGEST ISSUESanders has made universal health care his main policy focus. But when it comes to whom people trust on health care voters on Tuesday were somewhat more comfortable with Biden.When asked who would best be able to handle health care as president 41% of Michigan voters said they preferred Biden according to AP VoteCast. Just 31% liked Sanders. Biden also led on health care in Mississippi while Missouri was evenly split between both of them.CORONAVIRUS CURVEBALLBiden and Sanders cancelled campaign rallies because of the spread of coronavirus a rare example of an external event bringing a presidential race to a temporary halt. Both men had planned to address supporters Tuesday night at watch parties but cited public health warnings. And their plans going forward are up in the air.Their debate scheduled for Sunday in Arizona is still on but will not have an audience as previously planned.That likely affects Sanders more since the Vermont senator much like President Donald Trump campaigns as a populist who addresses large rallies with thousands of supporters. But Biden has just started to draw large crowds as well.At the least Biden and Sanders now have plenty of money to continue television and social media advertising in coming primary states. They will need it for a lineup of states that includes Illinois Ohio Florida and Arizona.
6,AP VoteCast: A state-by-state look at Democratic primaries,HANNAH FINGERHUT,Associated Press,0,https://apnews.com/d3eb12a0c6fcfb38b16f513d7a61e296,WASHINGTON (AP) — The Associated Press surveyed voters in three of the six states that held Democratic presidential contests on Tuesday. Here’s a snapshot of voters in Michigan Missouri and Mississippi — who they are and what matters to them — based on preliminary results from AP VoteCast conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago.MICHIGANPart of the “blue wall” that flipped to Donald Trump in 2016 Michigan is a top general election battleground — and was a major test for both former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders. Both men were hoping the results would prove they were best poised to fire up the Democrats that may decide the election in November. Biden came out victorious.Biden assembled his now-familiar coalition. He won older voters moderates and women. He showed strength with working-class voters. About 60% of voters in Michigan did not have a college degree and Biden won the majority of them. That advantage carried across race and gender in the suburbs and cities.Sanders meanwhile failed to expand his coalition or boost turnout among the young people who have powered his campaign. About 35% of Michigan voters were under 45. In California and Colorado states Sanders won last week the share of those voters was about 45%.For all Biden’s strength enthusiasm for his bid wasn’t overwhelming. Biden’s supporters were less likely to say they were very enthusiastic than Sanders’ 46% to 60%.And a significant slice of Democratic voters in Michigan — about 20% — said their decision on how to vote in November will depend on who is nominated as the Democratic candidate.A wide majority — roughly three-quarters — said they think the economic system in this country is unfair. That includes about a third describing it as “very unfair.” Among Michigan voters Biden was considered the candidate best poised to handle the economy.New absentee voting rules triggered a surge in early voting in Michigan. AP VoteCast isn’t based on in-person interviews conducted on election days; rather it’s a survey designed to capture opinions regardless of how and when voters choose to cast their ballot.MISSOURIWith the race narrowed to two major candidates voters’ views about electability came into sharp focus. In Missouri a Republican-leaning state Democratic primary voters were more confident in Biden’s chances of beating Trump than Sanders’. That might have helped the former vice president emerge victorious on Tuesday. The Associated Press called Biden the winner when polls closed.About 40% think Biden definitely could beat Trump and roughly another 40% say he probably could.But just about a quarter say Sanders definitely could defeat Trump in November with about 40% saying he probably could.Biden bested Sanders among men and women college graduates and those without a degree and white and African American voters. He enjoyed a significant advantage among older voters while Sanders maintained his edge among voters under 45. Moderates and conservatives lined up solidly behind Biden.While Sanders appeared to lead among liberal voters many of them — about 40% — supported Biden.Health care an issue that has intensely divided the field of Democratic candidates this cycle was named the most important issue facing the country by close to half of primary voters in Missouri. Roughly 2 in 10 considered climate change the top priority while about 1 in 10 said that of the economy.Voters divided about evenly over whether Sanders or Biden would be best able to handle health care as president. But on issues related to race Biden had an advantage over Sanders as the most capable candidate.MISSISSIPPIA majority of Democratic primary voters in Mississippi were African American and Biden won them 86% to Sanders’ 11%. Biden also led among white voters across age groups education levels and ideologies. He was called the winner by The Associated Press.Mississippi voters wanted a nominee that cares about people like them. Voters there ranked that as as big a priority as selecting a candidate who can beat Trump and exhibit strong leadership. About 9 in 10 primary voters in Mississippi said each of the three qualities was very important in a Democratic nominee and Biden overwhelmingly won the support of those voters.Health care was named the most important issue by about 40% of voters but roughly a quarter pointed to the economy. About 30% of voters overall described their families as “falling behind” financially compared with 60% who said they are holding steady and just about 10% “getting ahead.”Biden was thought to be the candidate best able to handle health care as well as issues related to race.About two-thirds of Mississippi voters expressed support for government-paid reparations to African Americans for slavery and racial discrimination but there was a significant divide by race. About 75% of black voters expressed support compared with about 40% white voters.____
7,As Americans take virus precautions Trump flouts advice,JILL COLVIN,Associated Press,0,https://apnews.com/55466402fcfd1234f4120623f364772a,WASHINGTON (AP) — At the Pentagon top military brass have been begun “social distancing” to avoid spreading disease. At the Capitol legislators have been encouraged to forgo hand shakes and flash the “Star Trek” Vulcan greeting instead.But at the White House President Donald Trump is flouting his own government’s advice on how to stay safe. He continues to shake hands with supporters and visitors hold large events and minimize the threat posed by a coronavirus outbreak that has infected more than 115000 people and killed over 4000 worldwide.Public health officials said Trump was sending the wrong message with his behavior and potentially putting the public at risk by sowing confusion and undermining efforts to keep people safe especially if the situation grows worse.“I think it’s beholden upon our leaders to follow the public health recommendations that the CDC the government public health are recommending and to emulate those practices” said Dr. Jason Farley a nurse epidemiologist and professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Nursing. He said that it sends “mixed messaging to the public” when recommendations aren’t heeded.When it comes to Trump he added “There’s nothing special about being the president of the United States that protects you from a virus like this unless you’re following the practices recommended for every 70-year-old.”Trump has repeatedly played down the risk both to the public and himself even as he claims that his administration is “taking this unbelievably seriously.”“It will go away. Just stay calm” Trump told reporters Tuesday. “Everybody has to be vigilant and has to be careful. But be calm. It’s really working out. And a lot of good things are going to happen.”When it comes to Trump’s continued glad-handing Vice President Mike Pence said Tuesday that’s unlikely to change despite going against the administration’s “broad recommendation” for other Americans.“In our line of work you shake hands when someone wants to shake your hand” he said. “And I expect the president will continue to do that. I’ll continue to do it.”For most people the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. But for some especially older adults and people with existing health problems it can cause more severe illnesses including pneumonia.Trump at 73 is considered at higher risk although his press secretary said Monday he “remains in excellent health.”The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urges those at higher risk of getting the virus to take “everyday precautions to keep space between yourself and others” avoid crowds handshaking and nonessential air travel.“During a COVID-19 outbreak in your community stay home as much as possible to further reduce your risk of being exposed” the CDC writes.Overall the CDC has suggested that workplaces encourage employees to stop shaking hands use videoconferences for meetings when possible and hold meetings in well-ventilated spaces if meetings are necessary.That hasn’t happened at the White House where Trump a self-professed “germophobe” sat shoulder-to-shoulder Tuesday with aides and health insurance executives traveled to Capitol Hill for a Senate lunch and awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom at a well-attended ceremony where he also shook hands with those in the front row.On Monday Trump was spotted shaking hands with supporters on a tarmac in Florida. And on Thursday he’s set to travel to the West Coast where he’ll attend fundraisers and the annual gathering of the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas.All that despite the fact that Trump has already had personal contact with several individuals known to have been exposed to the virus. They include Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz who traveled aboard Air Force One with the president on Monday and found out midflight that he was among a handful of GOP lawmakers who were exposed to a person who tested positive for the virus after last month’s Conservative Political Action Conference.Gaetz voluntarily quarantined himself as have several other legislators who had contact with the infected person at CPAC including Trump’s incoming chief of staff.“The President’s physician United States Secret Service and White House Operations have been working closely with staff and various agencies to ensure every precaution is taken to keep the President First Family and the entire White House Complex safe and healthy at all times” White House spokesman Judd Deere said in response to questions. He did not provide specifics about the nature of those precautions though the White House has repeatedly cited Trump’s propensity for hand-washing and Trump has joked that he’s avoided touching his face so long he’s missed it.“As we are all doing Americans should continue to follow the CDC’s guidance on travel and public gatherings which includes staying home if you feel ill as well as frequently washing your hands with soap and water” he said.The White House has begun to install hand-sanitizer dispensers around the building and some visitors to the building have been asked to report where they’ve traveled recently — though many who interact with the president regularly have received no kind of heightened screening.Lawrence Gostin a public heath expert and professor at Georgetown University said he believed it would be appropriate to implement enhanced screening at the White House to keep the president and Cabinet safe.“This is no different than being protected by a bullet from the Secret Service” he said. “Not only should they be following general health advice we give to the public they should be following much more rigorously ... because we can’t be in a political crisis at the same time we’re in a public health crisis.”Elsewhere across government the response has been more robust. At the Pentagon Defense Department officials have been sitting at least six feet apart in line with health guidance. And on Tuesday reporters’ chairs were spread out for a news briefing. On Capitol Hill Democratic lawmakers were barred from helping themselves to a breakfast buffet or touching serving utensils and told to avoid kissing hugging and shaking hands.But not Trump — a pattern that Robert Blendon a professor of health policy at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Harvard Kennedy School of Government said appeared motivated by Trump’s desire to protect the economy in an election year.“Right or wrong the president’s decided he wants to minimize the economic impact of this pandemic. ... He’s trying to do everything he can to protect the economy by saying ‘It will be over’ ‘It’s not that bad’ ‘Feel free to go places’” Blendon said. While much uncertainly remains “if it turns out to be more serious the president’s contributing to people not protecting themselves.”“The president should be keeping us safe. He shouldn’t be amplifying the risk” added Gostin of Georgetown University.“The message should be: Let’s have social distancing let’s avoid the usual cultural symbols of shaking hands let’s separate from one another and avoid either contracting or transmitting a very dangerous infection” Gostin said. “And it’s baffling to me that the president who should be the model of good behavior is modeling exactly the opposite.”
8,Sanders Biden cancel Ohio rallies over coronavirus concerns,ALEXANDRA JAFFE and WILL WEISSERT,Associated Press,0,https://apnews.com/cf061d4d68493a749b3b9532f142b6d4,WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden abruptly canceled election-night rallies Tuesday night in Cleveland amid concerns over the spread of the new coronavirus — as public health fears began transforming the 2020 race.The Democratic National Committee also announced that the party’s next debate being held Sunday in Arizona would not have a live audience “at the request of both campaigns and out of an abundance of caution.”The moves suggest the coronavirus could upend the Democratic primary at a pivotal time in the race for both candidates. Sanders is trying to regain some momentum in the latest round of voting Tuesday night while the former vice president is looking to further pad his delegate lead.Sanders had been planning to speak at a convention center in Cleveland as results from six voting states began rolling in. But he pulled the plug about three hours before the event was scheduled to start and his campaign announced that decisions on future events would be made on a case-by-case basis.“Out of concern for public health and safety we are canceling tonight’s rally in Cleveland. We are heeding the public warnings from Ohio state officials who have communicated concern about holding large indoor events during the coronavirus outbreak” Sanders’ campaign spokesman Mike Casca said in a statement. “All future Bernie 2020 events will be evaluated on a case by case basis.”A Biden spokesman initially suggested the former vice president’s own event in Cleveland would go on as scheduled but his campaign subsequently released a statement saying that the event was off and that they would consult with public health officials about future events.Publicly President Donald Trump’s campaign says coronavirus concerns have not yet affected their plans and on Sunday Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said “The campaign is proceeding as normal.”But at a White House press briefing Tuesday Vice President Mike Pence said that they’d evaluate future rallies “on a day to day basis.”“I am very confident that the campaign will take the very best information and make the very best decision going forward” he said.The campaign hasn’t announced another rally to follow the president’s last one in North Carolina on March 2 though the campaign did announce a “Catholics for Trump” coalition event in Milwaukee on March 19. Until now the Republican campaign had been keeping a steady pace of rallies this year. Trump is scheduled to travel to Las Vegas and Denver this week for fundraisers and a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition.For both Democratic candidates rallies have been a key opportunity to show off endorsements and build enthusiasm around their candidacy. But Democratic strategist Andrew Feldman suggested that forgoing future rallies could be particularly problematic for Sanders whose events draw thousands of supporters in major cities.“It is a detriment to Bernie Sanders who is fueled by his campaign rallies by the people that come and are part of his revolution” he said.Feldman said both candidates would have to focus more on online organizing and outreach using tools like streamed and tele-town halls. But he also argued that even as the crisis is bad news for Americans Trump’s handling of the issue — and the careening stock market — “is the biggest gift for Democrats.”“This is giving us an argument that the economy Donald Trump is going to be running on is not as strong as its supposed to be” he noted. He said Biden could use the opportunity to make the case for his experience dealing with crises as vice president while Sanders could use it to make a more emotional and direct case for “Medicare for All” as reports come in of individuals facing steep medical bills simply for getting tested for the virus.And he also questioned whether the coronavirus could affect turnout — particularly among the elderly who lean toward Biden. Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose said Tuesday that 128 polling locations will be moved out of nursing homes for the state’s March 17 primary.Some Democrats worry the coronavirus could complicate not just rallies but also every aspect of the election from turnout to fundraising and organizing.Kelly Dietrich CEO of the National Democratic Training Committee a group that trains Democrats who want to run for office or work on a campaign said they’re already seeing a decline in people who have registered to participate in their training over fear of showing up to large gatherings. “It’s not even just in virus hot spots” he said.“That fear is a prime motivator. It’s going to affect your campaign. It needs to be taken into account” Dietrich added.He also said it’s causing the group to rethink how to organize more broadly.“When we talk about door-knocking generally you smile you shake hands with the voter you make a connection — all kinds of things that are now maybe taboo” Dietrich said. “What do you do if people aren’t answering their doors anymore? How do you pivot to social or digital organizing?”DNC Communications Director Xochitl Hinojosa said Tuesday that the party decided to forgo a live audience at its next debate because its “number one priority has and will continue to be the safety of our staff campaigns Arizonans and all those involved in the debate.”Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine declared a state of emergency after three individuals from Cuyahoga County which includes Cleveland tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. He has “strongly” recommended that spectators be prohibited from attending indoor sports games — and said the same should be true for any large indoor event including concerts.For most people the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough. For some especially older adults and people with existing health problems it can cause more severe illness including pneumonia.Sanders is 78. Biden is 77.The vast majority of people recover from the virus. According to the World Health Organization people with mild illness recover in about two weeks while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to do so.Anthony Fauci the nation’s leading infectious disease expert has stopped short of calling on candidates to put a pause on political rallies. But he also isn’t faulting anyone who chooses to do so saying that what “they’re probably acting on is what they would consider for their citizens an abundance of caution.”“I wouldn’t criticize them for that. They’re using their own individual judgment” Fauci said. “And to me I think that that would be proven.”But he also added: “This is a something in motion. This is an evolving thing” so “if you’re talking about a campaign rally tomorrow in a place where there is no community spread I think the judgment to have it might be a good judgment.”___
9,Claire McCaskill transitions from Senate to television,DAVID BAUDER,Associated Press,0,https://apnews.com/8660dfacdc440a42f573b80b6ce2c557,NEW YORK (AP) — NBC News analyst Claire McCaskill is talking about some of the shows on which she appears — “Morning Joe” Rachel Maddow or Nicolle Wallace’s hours — when a questioner slips in a little test: What’s your favorite?She bats it away like an annoying fly.“I’m candid” she said. “I’m not stupid.”Clearly the political instincts of the former Democratic senator from Missouri haven’t dulled since her defeat in 2018. That’s also apparent on the air where she has emerged as a colorful and blunt analyst through President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial and the presidential primaries.McCaskill said Trump’s impeachment lawyers had learned “the Trump ethos which is if you’re cornered just lie” and sharply rebuked Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee on the air. When there was a question about how the Senate was going to proceed on a vote to call witnesses during the impeachment trial McCaskill took out her phone and texted several former colleagues for the lowdown.She’s been having a blast.“I have been shocked at how happy I am” McCaskill said in a recent interview steps away from an MSNBC set. “I assumed it was going to be more painful than it has been to not be in the fray but rather commenting on the fray.”After taking some time to unwind after losing her bid for a third term to Josh Hawley the 66-year-old McCaskill found that news organizations looking for analysts were calling her instead of the other way around. She had always tried to be forthright when talking to reporters — as much as any politician can be — and her willingness to answer questions was noticed. She was comfortable with MSNBC after making frequent appearances there.Since crossing over to the media McCaskill said she’s found “the freedom is exhilarating.”“The biggest transition was getting comfortable with the fact that I can say what I really think about Donald Trump” she said.And what would that be? “Donald Trump is a disaster for our country” she said.A little more diplomacy toward the president was required when she was active in Missouri politics since the Republican carried the state in the 2016 election. It has also enabled McCaskill to see what supporters admire in him. “Let’s be honest he hit some heartstrings” she said when analyzing Trump’s State of the Union speech.“What people see when they see her on the air isn’t somebody who read a poll or is making her best guess” Wallace said. “She lived it. She arrives at her position thoughtfully not reflexively.”Wallace former White House communications director in George W. Bush’s administration said she enjoys talking to someone who understands politics and government from being a participant. She was giddy on the air watching McCaskill text colleagues for inside info.Wagging a finger and looking into the camera McCaskill bluntly went after Blackburn during the impeachment hearings when the Republican tweeted criticism of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman. The White House national security aide was a key witness in the impeachment inquiry.“Don’t you lecture anybody about how patriotic a veteran like Vindman is when you are going to the mat for a man who stood next to Putin and trashed the United States of America” she said.Blackburn didn’t immediately return an email seeking comment from the AP about McCaskill. The AP reached out to the White House for comment about McCaskill’s criticism.McCaskill hasn’t yet come under sustained attack from Republicans. The last time Trump tweeted about her was to urge a vote for Hawley. After a McCaskill tweet suggested Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson was featured prominently in a picture of administration officials because he was one of the few black people there Trump aide Katrina Pierson called her a “closet racist.”“How’s unemployment?” Donald Trump Jr. said in a tweet.McCaskill called the response “manufactured outrage.”Otherwise she hasn’t gotten much critical attention because “you expect a Democrat to sound like a Democrat” said Tim Graham director of media analysis at the conservative Media Research Center.Being from a state like Missouri taught McCaskill that no matter what she did roughly half of her constituents would be happy and the other half mad — and not hesitant to tell her.“Some people who have not been through the political wars that I have been would be worried about that level of negativity” she said. “I get it. All in a day’s work. My bark is already so thick that it’s not like somebody calling me fat is going to make me cry.”Few people back home are surprised to see what she’s doing at NBC News said Steve Kraske a radio host at KCUR and a former newspaper columnist in Kansas City.As a senator McCaskill would hold town hall meetings in the most conservative areas of the state inviting audience members to write down questions that would randomly be drawn out of a hat so she couldn’t be accused of stage-managing the event he said.“She’s got a lot of Harry Truman in her” Kraske said referencing another plainspoken Missouri politician.Her new perch has given McCaskill the ability to give viewers an insider’s knowledge about what it’s like to be in the Senate such as a piece she did about the work of the Senate parliamentarian. She’s not happy about how the Senate has become more sharply partisan and noted that there’s no encouragement to build relationships with colleagues across the aisle.Even while watching the impeachment trial McCaskill said she wasn’t wishing she was on the Senate floor.“Chuck (Schumer) has said to me several times since I made the transition that ‘you look so damn happy. Stay away from the members because I don’t want them getting the idea that there is life after the Senate’” she said.
10,Hearing to be held after county ditched new voting machines,KATE BRUMBACK,Associated Press,0,https://apnews.com/a77bbc58ac8516b474dfa64c87ee690d,ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia’s state election board plans to hold an emergency hearing Wednesday to discuss whether election officials in one county violated state law or election rules when they decided not to use the state’s new voting machines for the presidential primary.The Athens-Clarke County Board of Elections voted 3-2 last week to sideline the new machines in favor of hand-marked paper ballots. Board Chairman Jesse Evans said the board found it “impracticable” when using the new machines to protect ballot secrecy and allow sufficient monitoring to prevent tampering as required by state law.Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger who chairs the State Election Board issued a notice two days later setting the Wednesday hearing in Athens.Athens about 70 miles (113 kilometers) east of Atlanta is home to the University of Georgia and surrounding Clarke County represents about 1% of the state’s active voters according to voter numbers on the secretary of state’s website.The March 24 presidential primaries mark the first statewide test for Georgia’s new $103 million voting system which combines electronic touchscreens with printed ballots that are tallied by a scanner. Some election integrity advocates have argued the big bright touchscreens with their large fonts and upright positioning make it easy to see how other people are voting.Georgia law requires all of the state’s 159 counties to use the new voting system. But it also allows county election officials to use paper ballots if using the electronic machines becomes “impossible or impracticable.”The Athens-Clarke County attorney warned county election board members before their vote that it would be difficult to meet that standard in court after the county’s own election supervisor insisted the machines could be arranged in a way that protects voters’ privacy.The hearing notice says the county board should be prepared to respond to questions and present testimony and evidence for “its determination that it is ‘impossible or impracticable’ to use electronic ballot markers in the ongoing election.”The state board and the county board will both be allowed to have a lawyer subpoena witnesses and documents and respond to and present evidence the notice says.

Six states will vote on Tuesday including Michigan - a key battleground state that narrowly went to Mr Trump in 2016.A simple guide to US primaries and caucusesA week ago three other former Biden rivals - Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota Pete Buttigieg a former mayor from Indiana and former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke - all endorsed the now Democratic frontrunner.Another former black candidate ex-Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick has also backed Mr Biden as did erstwhile rivals Mike Bloomberg Tim Ryan and John Delaney.Despite Mr Booker's fulsome endorsement for Mr Biden he has not always been so supportive.After a live TV debate in September the New Jersey senator seemed to express doubts about the 77-year-old former vice-president's mental acuity.Mr Booker said: ""There were a lot of moments where a number of us were looking at each other on stage when [Biden] tends to go on sometimes.""He added: ""There are definitely moments where you listen to Joe Biden and you just wonder."""
12,Super Tuesday: Why didn't more young people vote?,Helier Cheung,BBC,0,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51763333?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cwnpxwzd269t/us-politics&link_location=live-reporting-story,"Young people are the future of politics - or at least they should be.In the US people aged 39 and younger - millennials and Generation Z - now make up more than a third of eligible voters. They're considered more ethnically diverse and liberal than older generations and experts say they could make a significant impact on this year's elections.Except younger voters as a cohort consistently turn out in lower numbers than older generations.The Democratic Party is currently electing its nominee to take on President Donald Trump in November's election and one candidate Senator Bernie Sanders has argued he alone can mobilise young and new voters.The 78-year-old is uniquely popular with the young - according to some polls he's the first choice of about 50% of Democratic primary voters aged 18-38.On Super Tuesday surveys suggest Mr Sanders won the youth vote in every single state - yet there wasn't a spike in overall youth turnout and Mr Sanders still lost out to former Vice-President Joe Biden 77 who won 10 out of 14 states.Mr Sanders has admitted that it was ""not easy"" mobilising the youth vote. ""Have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in? The answer is no.""All you need to know about US electionWhy the wait for a female US president goes onWinners and losers on Super TuesdayJohn Della Volpe the director of polling at Harvard Kennedy School has led surveys on American youth voters since 2000. He says that based on exit polling data ""there is credible evidence to suggest that the youth vote is flat to down in most states... young people are just not as enthusiastic as many of us expected them to be"".So why aren't more young people voting in the Democratic primaries - and what sort of an impact would this have on November's presidential elections?The honest answer is - it's complicated and there are several different factors involved.1. It's not always easy to vote - even when you want toSurveys suggest young people are interested in politics - one Harvard poll last year found that 43% of 18-29 year olds said they were likely to vote in their party's primary.But actual turnout appears to have been far lower than that - analysis of exit polls from Tufts University suggests youth turnout in the Super Tuesday states ranged from 5% to 19%.And even in the states where the overall number of young voters increased they were dwarfed by a larger increase from older voters.One reason? The process of casting your ballot can be complicated - especially for first time voters.""There's no candidate that magically makes voters show up at the polls"" says Abby Kiesa director of impact at CIRCLE a research organisation at Tufts university focused on youth engagement.""A young person doesn't turn 18 and realise 'oh my voting location is here'... too many people assume that just because we have the internet everything is obvious and it's not.""Image copyrightLINA TATEImage captionLina Tate didn't receive her ballot until three days after Super TuesdayMany young people have complained about accidentally missing the registration deadline - and for students living out of their home states getting an absentee ballot can be even more complicated.Benjamin Clardy 21 is currently studying in Italy - and found that postal ballot requirements meant he had to ""print out a very specific kind of envelope"". The problem? He didn't have the right printer and had to track down a specialist printer in Venice.Small barriers can add up says Grace Wells 22 a Texan currently studying in Chicago.""Most of us don't have printers at home anymore"" she says. ""When you're living a busy life figuring out who to vote for and trying to remember and navigate different voting processes for a county you don't live in it can be tough.""And the system can be unreliable. Lina Tate 20 registered for an absentee ballot in mid-February - but did not receive her ballot until 6 March - three days after Super Tuesday.She has since sent off her ballot but felt ""very annoyed"" at the process. ""As a younger voter I know that older generations already think we don't turn out to vote... [but] this is an important process for me.""The three all managed to cast their votes eventually - but the system makes it harder for young voters who aren't extremely well-organised or motivated.Meanwhile many voters in Texas and California faced a physical challenge - as long lines meant they had to wait several hours to vote.Image Copyright @christofspieler@CHRISTOFSPIELERReportRights groups in Texas said wait times were particularly long in student neighbourhoods - and one 19-year-old told the Guardian he queued for an hour and a half but had to leave to go to class. He returned shortly after 19:00 when polls closed and waited for two hours but was then told he was no longer allowed to vote.2. Quite a lot of young people feel disillusionedMr Della Volpe says there are very real structural barriers including gerrymandering and difficulties with absentee ballots that make it hard for young people to vote - but there are also ""attitudinal barriers that need to be addressed"".""Young Americans vote when they can see a tangible difference that their participation can make"" he says arguing that this motivated record turnout levels in the 2018 mid-term elections.In general however many young people can feel disengaged from politics. A Harvard survey found that only 16% of those aged 18 to 29 agreed with the statement that ""elected officials who are part of the Baby Boomer generation care about people like me.""Image copyrightBENJAMIN CLARDYImage captionBenjamin felt ""disappointed"" at the last-minute rallying behind Joe Biden ahead of Super TuesdayWithin the Democratic party many young voters feel that the party's establishment has not been listening to them.Mitchell Allen 18 voted for Bernie Sanders but says: ""A lot of kids my age feel the system works against them - there's no point voting because the establishment will win.""Ms Wells who also voted for Mr Sanders argues ""it's difficult to mobilise people in a system that's continuously telling them their political goals and movements they want to see happening are not viable.""Meanwhile Mr Clardy supported Pete Buttigieg - but also found the last-minute rallying behind Joe Biden ""sad... it seemed like the Democratic Party was not acknowledging that there are problems.""3. A lot of high school students get less information about politicsSeveral young voters say they found it easier to engage in politics once they went to university.Michaela Pernetti 22 remembers people ""didn't want to talk about"" politics at her high school in Sacramento California.""Families don't talk about it so kids don't and you don't want to bring it up and get in a fight with your friends."" She found much more of a ""political atmosphere"" once she went to university.Ethan Somers 20 tried to encourage his friends to register to vote when he was in high school in Lakewood Colorado but said many were likely to respond: ""Do I really need to?""Image copyrightETHAN SOMERSImage captionStudents ""have to deal with college housing loans and the stress of having to register to vote and file an absentee ballot"" - Ethan Somers""A lot of people at my community college came from low socio-economic backgrounds and faced real hardship"" Mr Somers says.""In this small town we were in they saw politics as a thing that happened in Washington and it didn't feel like the things they would vote on would make a difference to their lives. They felt politics had failed them in a way that made it too frustrating to deal with.""A lot of the divide comes down to the fact that political campaigns rely on visiting college campuses - which means ""young people who do not have college experience are much less likely to be contacted"" says Ms Kiesa from CIRCLE.‘We work full time but still can’t afford food’It is problematic ""when systemic inequity in [political] access starts so early"" she adds.4. It's also down to the politicians in the raceA lot of people have blamed young people for not voting - or say Bernie Sanders failed to mobilise them - but experts say the other political campaigns played a part too.Media caption'Which candidate will you swipe right on?'""Mr Sanders is not responsible for turning out all young people"" says Mr Della Volpe. ""The other reason that youth turnout was low is because other candidates did not make them a strategic focus of their campaigns.""What the other candidates forgot he argues is that 50% of young Democratic voters did not say they supported Mr Sanders - so he believes they lost a ""huge opportunity"" to attract younger voters.And the fact there were so many candidates competing for much of the race could have put off some younger voters.""The field was so convoluted I think some young people stopped trying to figure out who would be the best candidate and decided 'I'll just vote in the general election'"" says Mr Somers.5. Finally - things could still be very different in NovemberPrimary elections are complicated - and experts disagree on the best way to compare youth turnout.Harvard pollsters compared 2020 turnout with the most recent Democratic primaries in 2016 where Bernie Sanders also ran. Meanwhile experts at CIRCLE say youth turnout in 2020 actually increased compared to 2012 - which is the last time only one party (the Republicans) had a competitive primary.What they do agree on is that young people have already made a significant impact on politics - and that things can be very different in general elections.The 2018 mid-term elections saw youth turnout shoot up to 36% - compared to 20% in 2014 - and led to several records being broken.In part this was because ""in some ways the 2018 vote was a referendum on Trump's policies"" says Mr Della Volpe whereas ""Trump has not been a major factor in the 2020 primary - it's essentially a referendum on Bernie Sanders.""Meanwhile Ms Kiesa says that several events in 2018 including the Parkland shooting mobilised young people to campaign on issues including gun safety and voter registration.Young people ""really do have the ability to create change"" she adds. ""We should be very careful not to draw any conclusions on youth turnout in the general election based on the primary."""
13,Elizabeth Warren: Where did it go wrong for her?,Anthony Zurcher,BBC,0,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51761233?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cwnpxwzd269t/us-politics&link_location=live-reporting-correspondent,"Now that she has dropped out post-mortems on Elizabeth Warren's campaign - which was leading the polls in the autumn - have begun.Many point to her shifting her support from an immediate push for universal government-run healthcare as president to a phased transition. It caused liberals to stick with Bernie Sanders and centrist to have their doubts about her - all on an issue that unlike ethics and economic reform was never her top priority.Others suggest she was harmed by hesitant performances in the debates that mattered - before the Iowa and New Hampshire contests. Her strongest effort came with her vivisection of Michael Bloomberg in Las Vegas which was buried by Sanders's win in the Nevada caucuses. While her showing may have given her a fund-raising boost it was too late to help her at the ballot box there .Then there's the issue of sexism. Four years after Democrats chose Hillary Clinton to be their nominee voters may have been reluctant to opt for another woman atop the ticket. This hesitance was seldom explicit. Instead it displayed itself in concerns about ""likability"" or ""electability"" and what hypothetical swing-state voters might think of her.It also sometimes reared its head in Warren's media coverage where her healthcare backtracking received considerably more criticism than similar pirouettes and hedging by Pete Buttigieg and other male candidates.The US will elect its first woman president someday but it will not be in 2020.Listen to Americast: Warren is out!Who are the Democrats vying to take on Trump?Winners and losers on Super TuesdayInstead the concern of the moment moves to who Warren might endorse for president - Sanders or Joe Biden - or if she will weigh in at all.Given their ideological similarities Sanders seems like the obvious choice - despite their personal conflicts in the past few months. A less likely move would be to back Biden but there would be some value in it for her if she could leverage some concessions from his camp such as the promise of being his treasury secretary with a free hand to run the department as she sees fit.Warren may be fairly confident a Sanders administration would do the right thing policy-wise. She may not be so sure about Biden which is why elbowing her way into the a top admin post would be valuable.Then there's the fact that at least for now Biden seems to be in a better position to get the nomination than Sanders so aligning with the winning side always has its benefits.A simple guide to US primaries and caucusesHow left-wing is the Democratic 2020 field?Of course you can't discount the absolute rage and sense of betrayal a Warren endorsement of Biden would provoke on the progressive left. Her social media accounts would disappear beneath an avalanche of snake emojis.There's also a strategic downside. If she wanted to run as the progressive standard-bearer in 2024 crossing Sanders now would be deadly.While her campaign didn't end close to the way she would have liked Warren has some interesting choices to make in the days ahead."
14,Super Tuesday: The winners and losers in Democratic race,Anthony Zurcher,BBC,0,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51731922?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cwnpxwzd269t/us-politics&link_location=live-reporting-correspondent,"A four-way contest soon became a two-horse race as the results from 14 US states rolled in. But who were the biggest winners and losers in the Democratic race to challenge Donald Trump?WINNERSJoe BidenWhat happened?Joe Biden came into Super Tuesday hoping his momentum from a surprisingly big South Carolina win would translate into success in some of the states and allow him to keep within sight of Bernie Sanders in the delegate count. By that metric his evening succeeded beyond his best expectations.Image copyrightEUROPEAN PHOTOPRESS AGENCYKey takeaways1) Biden's support among black voters which was on display in South Carolina was replicated across the South in states like North Carolina Virginia and Alabama where he consistently won around 60%. It also helped offset Bernie Sanders' strength with Hispanic voters in Texas.2) Joe-mentum was real. According to exit polls voters who decided who to support in the last few days before Super Tuesday broke overwhelmingly toward Biden. While that didn't help him in California where almost half the electorate voted early it proved decisive elsewhere. Biden was even winning states like Arkansas and Tennessee which he didn't even campaign in. That was the power of his momentum.3) The endorsements mattered. On Monday Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar dropped out of the presidential race and threw her support behind Biden. In her home state a race that had appeared to be a toss-up between her and Sanders ended up being a near double-digit Biden win. Biden held an endorsement-palooza in Dallas on Monday with support from Klobuchar Pete Buttigieg and Beto O'Rourke. He greatly overperformed his polls there as well.What next?Tuesday night was a celebration for Biden but now the hard work begins. He is in for a state-by-state slog against Sanders that could stretch all the way to the Democratic National Convention in July. He'll have to fundraise furiously and organise rapidly to make up for the Vermont senator's campaign advantages. Meanwhile Republicans are going to start training their fire on him - again.Super Tuesday results in fullA simple guide to US primaries and caucusesBernie SandersWhat happened?The Vermont senator was hoping Super Tuesday would be his knockout punch. Instead it looks as if he's in for a full 15-round heavyweight fight with Joe Biden. While he is on course to win the biggest prize of the evening California it was counterbalanced by losses in at least eight of the remaining 13 states.Image copyrightREUTERSKey takeaways1) Sanders' Latino support is still strong. One of the big differences between Sanders in 2016 and Sanders today is that his coalition is no longer just liberal white voters. His appeal to Latino voters particularly the young was first on display in Nevada - and he demonstrated it across the Super Tuesday states where according to exit polls he won 35% of their vote.2) Speaking of young voters Sanders straight-up dominated the under-29 vote once again winning 65% to Biden's 17%. The challenge for the Sanders camp however is that there is little indication that they're turning out in higher numbers than usual. If there was a surge in turnout in Super Tuesday states it was from moderate suburban voters - the kind that are more inclined to support Biden.3) Vermont may be home but it wasn't quite as sweet. Bernie lost some states like Minnesota and Massachusetts that he thought he had a good shot at winning and struggled in others like Texas and Maine. Perhaps most surprising however is the Vermont senator only took 50% in Vermont. Given that Sanders took his home state and all its delegates in 2016 with 85.7% that is a remarkable result.What next?A key tell from Super Tuesday was that Sanders gave his ""victory"" speech and his supporters packed up and went home before the polls in California his strongest state even closed. The evening did not go the way the Vermont senator and his loyal fans would have liked.While Biden may be riding high for the moment however Sanders continues to pull in political donations unlike anyone else in the field - $46.5m in February alone - and has a battle-tested campaign team that went through a similar state-by-state primary grind against Clinton in 2016.Outside of California Tuesday was a rough night for Sanders but the race for the Democratic nomination is far from over.Eighteen things Bernie Sanders believesLOSERSMike BloombergWhat happened?Michael Bloomberg's unconventional presidential campaign strategy of skipping the early states and spending heavily on Super Tuesday just ran head-first into cold hard reality.Image copyrightGETTY IMAGESKey takeaways:1) While most of the candidates in the race were liked by Democrats Bloomberg was underwater. In Virginia for instance 56% of primary voters viewed him unfavourably. Hundreds of millions of dollars in slick television adverts and glossy mailers won't do any good if voters don't trust you.2) Bloomberg spent $34 million in television and radio advertisements in Alabama North Carolina and Virginia while Biden spent a fraction of that amount - and won all three. The early warning signs - empty campaign offices sparsely attended voter canvassing events - turned out to be harbingers of doom.3) He was surging in the polls just a few weeks ago. Then the Las Vegas debate and his evisceration at the hands of Elizabeth Warren happened. While many of the debates this campaign have had negligible effects that one mattered.What next?Bloomberg quit the race and said he would support Biden. The two stated goals of his candidacy besides actually winning the nomination were defeating Trump and preventing Sanders from being the nominee. But while the former New York mayor says he will redirect his considerable resources and organisation towards the general election it is not clear if he will help Biden against Sanders.Who is Michael Bloomberg?Elizabeth WarrenWhat happened?After losses in Iowa New Hampshire Nevada and South Carolina political analysts asked if there were any states where Elizabeth Warren might be competitive. On Super Tuesday it was clear that there wasn't - not even her home of Massachusetts which she lost to Biden despite the fact that he never visited or spent money advertising there.Image copyrightREUTERSKey takeaways1) How embarrassing was Warren's home-state defeat? There was no demographic - men women young old white black rich poor liberal moderate educated or not - that she carried according to exit polls.2) Warren will pick up delegates in Massachusetts and one in Virginia and she might net a few elsewhere. If the race between Biden and Sanders goes to the convention even the handful of delegates she has could be valuable in deciding who gets the nomination. If there's a silver lining to her Super Tuesday that's about as good as it gets.What next?Warren is still fund-raising and says she's going to keep campaigning in the coming states. There will however be considerable pressure on her from the Sanders camp to wrap things up and endorse him as the moderates have for Biden. Perhaps his supporters were wishing they had held their tongue and sent fewer snake emojis her way when things got tense between the two candidates back in January."

""He wanted to run everything.""At 78 Mr Bloomberg has been the boss of many things - the chief executive of a financial data firm the mayor of America's most populous city the head of a national gun control group the founder of a news service that bears his name.Speculation over whether the technocratic billionaire would one day run for president of the United States had been rife since his entry into politics in 2001 when he won the New York mayoral race as a Republican.Media captionBloomberg loses badly on Super TuesdayAfter pursuing progressive policies as a philanthropist in his post-mayoral life he entered the 2020 Democratic primary and spent nearly $500m (£390m) of his own fortune in an effort to prove to voters that as one of the richest men in the world he was the only candidate who could beat Donald Trump.But after failing to win a single state and only gathering a handful of delegates he dropped out of the race and threw his weight behind former Vice-President Joe Biden.From modest roots to moneyed manMr Bloomberg was born in 1942 into a middle-class family - the son of a book-keeper.After studying engineering at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore he got his first job on Wall Street upon completing an MBA at Harvard in 1966.He secured a position at Salomon Brothers and by 1972 he had become a partner. But his relationship with the firm ended abruptly nine years later when Salomon Brothers was bought out and Mr Bloomberg was sacked.He used his stake from the Salomon sale to found his own business - now a global media and financial data empire named after him.The Democratic 2020 race - in five chartsA simple guide to US primaries and caucusesToday Bloomberg LP has offices around the world. It is the leading global provider of financial data and has made Mr Bloomberg a very wealthy man.With an estimated net worth of $64 billion (£49 billion) he was the ninth richest person in the world in 2019 according to Forbes - and the sixth richest in America.GettyThe scale of a billionaire$64bnis Mike Bloomberg's estimated net worth$62000is the US median household income660000median US incomes together equal Bloomberg's wealth6500is the number of households to equal Trump's wealthSource: CBS NewsBut he has always wanted more and has admitted to being a man who craves admiration.""Adulation is great"" he was once quoted as saying.A turn to politicsImage copyrightGETTY IMAGESImage captionMr Bloomberg with his predecessor as mayor Republican Rudy Giuliani who endorsed his first run in 2001Though never considered a charismatic candidate Mr Bloomberg never lost an election before his humiliation in 2020.In his first race to become mayor in 2001 he switched parties from Democrat to Republican secured the endorsement of Rudy Giuliani his predecessor and now lawyer to President Trump and spent tens of millions of dollars to win.He raised taxes and cut costs - never vote-winners - and gained a reputation as a technocratic killjoy.Bloomberg on tape: All crime is in minority areasIn his first term he banned smoking for bars fought with transport unions and launched a crusade against street vendors. Tabloid papers began referring to the mayor as ""Gloomberg"".But an improved economy better school results and falling crime rate under his mayoralty won him a second term in office in 2005 with a victory margin of 20% - the highest for any Republican in New York.He left the party in the middle of his second term running and winning a third as an independent.

When he left office in 2013 his 12 years at city hall were seen as a success by New Yorkers and his subsequent philanthropic activities - including his biggest project backing gun control legislation across the US - put him solidly in the Democratic camp once again.In 2018 he spent $41m backing Democratic candidates running for the US House of Representatives. Twenty-one out of the 24 he supported won 15 of whom were women. In 2019 he donated $3.9 billion to charities supporting top issues on the left from green energy to abortion access.But Mr Bloomberg's bid to become the man to take on Mr Trump in 2020 struck a discordant tone with a party that made demands for race gender and income equality a large part of its diagnosis for America's ills.Media captionDemocratic rivals attack Bloomberg in TV debateHis record particularly on race faced fierce scrutiny. A hard-line policing tactic stop and frisk that was expanded by Mr Bloomberg over the course of his mayoral terms was criticised as racist and ineffective.Comments the former mayor had made about women and minorities resurfaced and came back to haunt him and were used as a cudgel against him.Throughout his campaign Mr Bloomberg faced accusations that he was seeking to buy the White House. As he dropped out in March he vowed to spend millions more of his own cash to defeat Mr Trump and give any and all financial support to the eventual Democratic nominee."
16,Bernie Sanders: Who is the Democratic White House hopeful?,,BBC,0,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34532136?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cwnpxwzd269t/us-politics&link_location=live-reporting-story,"Bernie Sanders a 78-year-old senator from Vermont is a front-runner in the Democratic race for president. The registered independent has performed well in the first states to vote and is poised for further victory as millions of Americans head the polls on Tuesday. So who is he?Senator Bernie Sanders likes beating the odds. His first political victory running in 1981 for mayor of Burlington Vermont pitted him against the Democratic machine that had controlled the city for decades.Mr Sanders won - by a margin of 10 votes - but the political newcomer still faced formidable resistance from within the city government. On Vermont's city council 11 of 13 members opposed Mr Sanders and actively conspired against his agenda.This same Democratic machine worked to thwart his re-election two years later but Mr Sanders emerged triumphant - this time by more than 20 percentage points. The battle offered an early taste of Mr Sanders' career which has represented a nearly 40-year challenge to the political establishment.Image copyrightSCOTT HEINS/GETTY IMAGESBouncing back from a bitter loss to former US First Lady and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016 Mr Sanders is running again for the top prize. This time around he's suffered a heart-attack and fundraised more than $167m (£130m).Here's a look at who he is and what the self-proclaimed democratic socialist stands for.Mr Sanders was born in Brooklyn New York to Jewish parents. He once said his humble upbringing in a tiny apartment made him class-conscious at an early age.He attended the University of Chicago and in the 1960s and 1970s participated in anti-war and civil rights activism like the 1963 March on Washington.He applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War though he was too old to be drafted by the time his application was rejected.Mr Sanders entered politics in 1971 running for a US Senate seat in Vermont as a Liberty Union candidate a party with anti-war and socialist roots. He lost that race along with a couple of campaigns to become governor.Image copyrightUNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO LIBRARYImage captionBernie Sanders speaks at a Committee on Racial Equality Sit-In in 1962His first major political success came when he was elected mayor of Burlington Vermont in 1980 beating a six-term incumbent. He went on to serve four terms.It was during this time that he met and married his current wife Jane O'Meara the former president of Burlington College once described as a ""key adviser"" in his political career. Combined they have four children from previous relationships.He was first elected to the US House of Representatives in 1990 the first independent to do so in 40 years. He served there until he ran for and won a seat in the Senate in 2007. During that campaign a younger Barack Obama stumped for him.Image copyrightKENA BETANCUR/GETTY IMAGESSince first arriving in Washington Mr Sanders has assailed Republican and Democratic politicians alike as being beholden to wealthy donors and industries - for this he was sometimes dismissed as a gadfly. He is the longest-serving independent in congressional history.In 2010 he famously stood and spoke for eight-and-a-half hours to attempt to block the extension of Bush-era tax policies that Mr Sanders said benefited the rich and worsened the nation's income gap.He became the chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs in 2013 and helped negotiate bipartisan solutions when former soldiers complained of dangerously delayed and inadequate care around the country. He was a staunch opponent of the Iraq War.He is fond of praising the social policies of Nordic countries like universal healthcare and paid leave for new parents. He wants to make college free and erase all student debt.Mr Sanders has been attacked for his voting record on gun control including his past opposition to various forms of the Brady Bill which required background checks and waiting periods for gun purchasers. Now the senator from firearms-friendly Vermont supports measures like expanded background checks for gun purchases - something he voted against in Congress in 1993.""The world has changed and my views have changed"" he said this year at the New Hampshire presidential debate.Image copyrightKENA BETANCUR/GETTY IMAGESIn 2016 during his last presidential run Mr Sanders jumped into the Democratic race as a long-shot candidate squaring off against establishment favourite Hillary Clinton. But once again Mr Sanders confounded expectations: setting fundraising records and for a time casting doubt on the once-seemingly inevitable nomination of Mrs Clinton.Now anti-establishment tone intact Mr Sanders is running on a characteristically progressive platform featuring Medicare for all a $15 minimum wage and tuition-free public college. He is quick to note that many items on his agenda - once deemed radical - are now embraced by Democrats.Still some Democratic leaders remain sceptical that Mr Sanders could win their party's nomination a degree of doubt that seems to galvanize him.In October his candidacy appeared in peril after Mr Sanders suffered a minor heart attack and was forced to suspend his campaign. The episode reignited criticism that Mr Sanders is too old to compete for the presidency. The Vermont senator - who will be 79 by election day - would be the oldest US president in history.But within weeks he was back bolstered by an endorsement from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez the party's liberal darling and youngest ever US congresswoman.Mr Sanders is an unapologetic curmudgeon - he shrugged off a claim by Mrs Clinton that nobody likes him saying: ""On a good day my wife likes me."" And few other candidates could get away with telling a voter's crying baby to ""keep that down"". But Mr Sanders' supporters say it goes to show he is authentic.He now draws crowds in the tens of thousands as he makes the case that the 2020 election will be won because of his principle and policy not in spite of it.Heading into Super Tuesday - in which millions of voters in 14 states will cast their ballot for the Democratic nominee - Mr Sanders leads rivals Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren. And if the outsider candidate is able to clinch victory in those states he may be poised to beat the odds once again.Image copyrightRALPH FRESO/GETTY IMAGES"

Instead it woke up moderates and other voters not sold on his calls for a progressive revolution prompting a rapid consolidation around an alternative.After more than a year of campaigning the race for the Democratic nomination is now shifting by the hour.Announcing her candidacy in the middle of a blizzard last February Ms Klobuchar a former prosecutor pitched herself as a pragmatist who could appeal to voters in America's geographic and ideological middle.She opposed the ""Medicare for All"" universal healthcare schemes touted by her leftwing rivals Mr Sanders and Ms Warren making the case for what she called more ""practical"" healthcare reform.Media captionWhy is the Latino vote so important?""I always tell people"" Ms Klobuchar would say on the campaign trail. ""If you are tired of the nonsense and the noise in our politics and you are tired of the extremes in our politics and you are looking for something different then you have a home with me"".Despite winning some support from moderate Republicans who oppose Mr Trump she had failed to attract support from the black and Hispanic voters who are key Democratic blocs."
19,Pete Buttigieg drops out of Democratic race for White House,,BBC,0,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51700771?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cwnpxwzd269t/us-politics&link_location=live-reporting-story,"Pete Buttigieg the former Indiana mayor who made an ambitious run for president has announced he is ending his campaign for the White House.The 38-year-old became the first openly gay presidential candidate from a major party when he announced he was running for the Democratic nomination.But despite a successful start his campaign lost momentum in recent weeks.His decision to drop out comes ahead of a key day on Tuesday in the Democratic race to take on Trump.Fourteen states will vote on Super Tuesday by the end of which staunch left-winger Bernie Sanders could have an unbeatable lead and be a step closer to the nomination.His departure leaves six Democrats still in the running - Joe Biden Mr Sanders Michael Bloomberg Elizabeth Warren Amy Klobuchar and Tulsi Gabbard.What California voters want from this electionWhat are primaries and how do they work?Speaking to supporters in his hometown of South Bend Indiana Mr Buttigieg stressed the values he said his campaign had hoped to promote.""And so we must recognise that at this point in the race the best way to keep faith with those goals and ideals is to step aside and help bring our party and our nation together"" he said. ""So tonight I am making the difficult decision to suspend my campaign for the presidency.""He pledged he would do ""everything in my power"" to ensure a Democratic win in November's election.Mr Buttigieg surprisingly and narrowly won the first event of the primary season the caucuses in Iowa on 3 February. But he failed to repeat that success and win the delegates needed to make him the front- runner and later confirm his nomination. He finished a distant fourth in South Carolina on Saturday.Mr Biden praised Mr Buttigieg's campaigning effort in a tweet.Mr Buttigieg's husband Chasten also addressed crowds of supporters in South Bend saying: ""About a year and a half ago my husband came home from work and told me - well he asked me: 'What do you think about running for president?' And I laughed! Not at him but at life.""Life gave me some interesting experiences on my way to find Pete. After falling in love with Pete Pete got me to believe in myself... and I told Pete to run [for office] because I knew there were other kids sitting out there in this country who needed to believe in themselves too.""How Buttigieg set his sights on the White HouseIt was one of the least likely runs for the presidency in years: Mr Buttigieg's only political experience had been as the centrist mayor of the 306th largest city in the US South Bend Indiana between 2012 and January this year.Before then he had served as a US Navy intelligence officer and in the Afghan war.He was the first millennial to run for the White House and would have been the youngest president to take office had he won.  The son of a Maltese immigrant he had long been rumoured as a possible candidate in the 2020 election. But after announcing his candidacy in April last year he was able to break through a crowded group to become one of the most recognisable faces in the campaign.In that time he raised more than $82m (£64m) according to the Federal Election Commission one of the highest totals of all the candidates.In recent weeks his sexuality had been highlighted as an issue by critics - conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh asked if voters would pick a man ""kissing his husband on stage"".Mr Buttigieg - pronounced Boot-Edge-Edge - came out as gay aged 33 and married his husband Chasten in June 2018.He also struggled to build support among African-American voters a point emphasised by his poor showing in South Carolina.His record as mayor came under fire among minority voters - he had fired South Bend's first African American police chief and was criticised over how he handled the case of a white police officer who shot dead a black man last year.How this news will help BidenJust over a week ago Pete Buttigieg had a lead in Democratic convention delegates. Now the former South Bend mayor is out of the race.That's how quickly fortunes can change in presidential politics.In the end Buttigieg simply couldn't turn his early success into a national wave of support. While he thrived in the months of retail campaigning in the first two small - and exceedingly white - states the Nevada and South Carolina results amply demonstrated that he was never going to catch on with the more diverse national Democratic electorate.It's still a bit of a shock that Buttigieg pulled the plug rather than compete on Super Tuesday. By doing so however he avoids the potential for more defeats and helps Joe Biden who will certainly appreciate the mayor's move to clear the field for him to better challenge Bernie Sanders one-on-one.In the end Buttigieg made an astounding effort coming from nowhere to seriously challenge for the nomination winning the Iowa caucuses and raising massive amounts of campaign cash. It's a remarkable accomplishment for the first openly gay presidential candidate with a difficult-to-pronounce name who was half the age of his closest presidential rivals.His campaign will be one for the history books.What happens next?Super Tuesday is the most important date in the race to pick the nominee.Democrats in 14 states will vote (as well as American Samoa and Democrats Abroad). A massive 1357 delegates will be distributed - almost a third of all those available through the entire primary season. The two most populous states California and Texas will be among those voting.Super Tuesday explained (with moose cod and dinosaurs)The entire picture could change in one day. Or we could see Mr Sanders cement his lead as the front-runner - and even extend into a near-unbeatable lead.This will also be the first time that New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg will be on the ballot. The performance of moderates like Mr Biden on Super Tuesday will be determined to some degree by how Mr Bloomberg fares."
20,South Carolina primary: Who are the winners and losers?,Anthony Zurcher,BBC,0,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51678640?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.com/news/topics/cwnpxwzd269t/us-politics&link_location=live-reporting-correspondent,On Saturday South Carolina became the fourth US state to join the race to find a Democrat to take on Republican Donald Trump in November's general election. Who were the big winners and losers?Enter the most diverse electorate of the states that have gone so far - one that better reflects the national make-up of the Democratic Party.The South Carolina contest is particularly important because it is essentially the gateway to Super Tuesday in just two days when 14 states hold their own nominating contests.Here's a look at the man who got a boost and the candidates who were busted in the Palmetto State as South Carolina is known.A simple guide to the primariesWINNERSJoe BidenSouth Carolina had been billed as Joe Biden's last stand - where he poured time and resources into securing a positive result. Just a few weeks ago as his poll numbers sank across the nation it also appeared it would be his campaign's final resting place.Instead after a week of furious effort South Carolina gave Biden his first primary victory of the year - his first win in any of his three presidential bids in fact.Image copyrightGETTY IMAGESBiden may have one man in particular to thank for his success: Congressman James Clyburn a powerful voice in the state's black community who endorsed the vice-president on Wednesday. Exit polls indicate Clyburn's backing was an important factor for about half of the primary voters - and probably one of the reasons Biden posted such a dominating performance among the state's black voters.If he can match that kind of showing in states to come he's going to give Bernie Sanders a tough fight.Biden is going to have to hope his success in South Carolina translates into a surge on Super Tuesday without much assistance from his campaign however. He only recently began advertising in the upcoming states and a Saturday afternoon trip to North Carolina was the first time he left South Carolina in almost a week.He's still running on a wing and a prayer but at least for one night and in one state those prayers were answered.Is this Joe Biden’s big comeback?LOSERSBernie SandersImage copyrightGETTY IMAGESFour years ago South Carolina dealt the Vermont senator a resounding devastating defeat in his race against Hillary Clinton - a foreshadowing of the struggles he would have with black voters for the rest of the race.While the margin was narrower this time around it was still substantial - and he actually won a smaller percentage of the overall vote. The task for Sanders will be to show that the state's result this time is only a blip not a trend. His campaign is fortunate that while Biden is going to get a boost out of his win many early votes have already been cast in Super Tuesday states which could blunt the former vice-president's momentum.Sanders made a late push in South Carolina trying to land a knockout blow on Biden. That didn't happen - and Biden will pull close to or ahead of him on both delegates and total votes nationally once the dust settles. Sanders still is in an enviable position but it suggests he will be in for a long slog to the convention.Eighteen things Bernie Sanders believesCould it be Bernie Sanders v Donald Trump?Pete ButtigiegImage copyrightGETTY IMAGESAnother week another sign that the former South Bend mayor has been unable to turn his surprising success in Iowa and New Hampshire into traction elsewhere in the US. He sank almost $3m (£2.3m) into television and radio advertisements in the state this year second only to self-funded Tom Steyer.He finished a distant fourth. He may find pockets of success on Super Tuesday next week but it's getting increasingly difficult to imagine a scenario where he suddenly becomes a contender again. The same goes doubly for Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren.Tom SteyerImage copyrightGETTY IMAGESWhile other candidates were focusing on Iowa and New Hampshire the California hedge-fund billionaire bet heavily on Nevada and South Carolina. He saw polling bounces in both states (and resulting debate appearances) but it didn't translate into you know actual votes.With the writing on the wall for his campaign he announced his withdrawal from the race on Saturday night.In the end Steyer's $267 million in total campaign spending from his personal fortune bought him less than 100000 total votes some general goodwill and an evening of on-stage dancing to Back That Thang Up with rapper Juvenile.No matter what happens now that his candidacy is over they can't take that away from him.Michael BloombergImage copyrightGETTY IMAGESThe former New York City mayor's entire presidential campaign was premised on Biden cratering. Bloomberg only entered the race in November when it looked like Biden was faltering. Now the former vice-president is back on his feet and will at the very least eat up votes that could have gone to Bloomberg if he were the only viable non-Sanders candidate.Bloomberg is reportedly a numbers guy. If he is really concerned about a Sanders nomination he'll have to think long and hard about what the data suggests will be the impact of his campaign from here on out. If he wanted to stop the Vermont senator perhaps his best move would be to use his already reserved three-minute paid network television appearance on Sunday night to drop out of the race and endorse Biden before Super Tuesday.I wouldn't hold my breath.
21,Coronavirus test: What makes a good leader in times of crisis?,Linda Feldmann,The Christian Science Monitor,0,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2020/0325/Coronavirus-test-What-makes-a-good-leader-in-times-of-crisis,I alone can fix it” Donald Trump famously asserted at the 2016 Republican National Convention referring to “the system.” The arena erupted in cheers. Today amid a national crisis the script has flipped. In key ways President Trump has deferred to governors and hesitated to use the powers at his disposal – both formal and informal. The moment is laden with irony. Since taking office Mr. Trump’s critics have called him a wannabe autocrat as he blew through norms and pushed the boundaries of the Constitution’s checks and balances. Now at a time when a president might be expected to use executive authority to the max these same critics want him to be more autocratic. Call for a national lockdown some say. Order the production and acquisition of medical supplies New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo pleaded to the president as the state faces a surge of coronavirus cases.But the answer isn’t so simple. Taking centralized control of pandemic response is “an invitation to concentrate not just the power of the White House but also increase the likelihood of abuses and inefficiencies” says Jonathan Turley a constitutional scholar at The George Washington University Law School. [Editor’s note: As a public service all our coronavirus coverage is free. No paywall.]Patchwork responseEach state has its own “pandemic profile” he notes – including density of population topography and climate – and that means state and local authorities are better equipped to understand local needs. What about a nationwide lockdown as announced this week in the United Kingdom and even India with its 1.3 billion people?“That gets into a gray area. The president can’t even suspend habeas corpus without approval of Congress” says Professor Turley referring to the constitutional right against illegal confinement. “So if you’re going to have a true quarantine you’d need enhanced federal police powers.”But the president does have the bully pulpit. He could urge all Americans to stay home and pressure governors and mayors to issue curfews or “shelter in place” orders. Mr. Trump’s declaration of a “national emergency” announced March 13 frees up federal resources to address the crisis not command action from the populace. Ditto his activation Sunday of the National Guard for the three most-affected states which he stressed does not mean an imposition of martial law.  On Tuesday the Trump administration triggered the Defense Production Act for the first time to help states access virus testing kits and face masks. But some states are begging for more sweeping action on the order of President Franklin Roosevelt’s use of private industry during World War II. States have also been begging for help in preventing bidding wars for supplies such as N95 masks that have driven up costs in some cases eight-fold. On Monday Mr. Trump signed an executive order aimed at preventing price gouging and hoarding of critical supplies.  Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta argues that strong centralized leadership is essential at this critical moment. “I find it difficult to understand why someone who calls himself a wartime president was not prepared to fully mobilize the entire country in order to confront this crisis” says Mr. Panetta who served under President Barack Obama. “There’s no question we’ve had mixed messages coming from Washington.”Indeed President Trump is already looking to ease guidelines on social distancing in a matter of weeks not months in defiance of public health experts. His goal: to rescue the economy. “We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself” Mr. Trump has said. Governors expressed alarm over his call Tuesday to “open up” the country by Easter on April 12. Though under the 10th Amendment it is states that have the power to lift restrictions on people’s activities not the federal government. At heart COVID-19 has profoundly tested America’s multi-tiered system of governance and surfaced different models of leadership. Assertive proactive governors such as Mr. Cuomo and Mike DeWine of Ohio are earning plaudits while Ron DeSantis of Florida has faced criticism for resisting a statewide shutdown. Though he did order a 14-day quarantine for those flying into the state from New York New Jersey and Connecticut. Governor Cuomo is a Democrat and Governors DeWine and DeSantis are Republicans. But party is irrelevant in assessments of leadership skill. What matters most are key qualities and principles experts say: clarity foresight empathy managing expectations and – maybe most important – ability to adapt. “Leadership is situational but some things are inviolate” says retired Lt. Gen. Nadja West former commanding general of the U.S. Army Medical Command now at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Center for Public Leadership. “During good times you have to establish trust then it’s easier to ask people to do things when there’s a crisis.” General West also stresses that important information and good ideas can come from anyone on the team and can help the leader “see around corners.” Several years ago she heard of a potential medical threat in West Africa and took her information to then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey. It proved to be the early days of the Ebola outbreak. General Dempsey put together a task force and when President Obama asked what could be done the joint chiefs chairman was ready to respond. The Army defines leadership General West says as “the process of influencing people by providing direction and motivation to accomplish the mission and improve the organization. That means anyone can be a leader.”Matilda’s LawOf all the leaders who have come to prominence in the crisis most compelling may be Governor Cuomo of New York. Now in his third term the elder son of late Gov. Mario Cuomo is hardly a fresh presence – or even in normal times a particularly warm one.  But his daily press conferences an odyssey of info-packed PowerPoint slides and personal reflections have become appointment TV (or livestream) for those who want to see a “buck stops here” leader in action and a dose of compassion. “If someone wants to blame someone blame me” Mr. Cuomo said March 22 in announcing statewide business closures aimed at thwarting the virus. His elderly mother Matilda Cuomo and three grown daughters have become stand-ins for every baby boomer’s aging parents and young-adult children as he expresses concern for their welfare. Mr. Cuomo’s rules for behavior aimed at protecting vulnerable populations are dubbed “Matilda’s Law.”  Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Trump – both with “tough guy from Queens” facades – had developed a rapport during the crisis but clashed Tuesday amid Mr. Cuomo’s desperate plea for ventilators and other equipment. Until then Mr. Trump had prided himself on his dealings with governors from both sides of the aisle during the crisis. Then there’s Dr. Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the president’s coronavirus task force. (He’s advised every president since Ronald Reagan.) He has been a reassuring presence at Trump press conferences known for his diplomatic corrections of presidential pronouncements. “He goes his own way. He has his own style” Dr. Fauci said of Mr. Trump in a recent interview with Science Magazine. “But on substantive issues he does listen to what I say.”Often in fact leadership consists of good “followership” i.e. being a team player. Like Dr. Fauci Vice President Mike Pence has earned praise for his calming almost preacher-like presence as he stays on-message and never outshines the president. In the president’s Cabinet Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has been another standout working across the aisle effectively with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as they hashed out a massive stimulus deal to rescue the economy. Senate leaders announced an agreement early Wednesday morning and the chamber aims to vote later in the day after ironing out some last-minute issues.  Paul Light a professor of public service at New York University is no fan of Mr. Trump. But he says the problems with the handling of this crisis are by no means all the president’s fault.
22,When fighting bureaucracy means disbanding a pandemics office,Howard LaFranchi ,The Christian Science Monitor,0,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2020/0323/When-fighting-bureaucracy-means-disbanding-a-pandemics-office,When PBS journalist Yamiche Alcindor recently asked President Donald Trump about his decision to disband the National Security Council’s office for pandemics Mr. Trump said the question was “nasty.”       But it pointed to a fundamental tension in Mr. Trump’s view of government. Can he “streamline” a government that he feels has become too bloated while maintaining its ability to act effectively?The administration sees this as essential work returning the NSC to its core function as an advisory body of several executive branch secretaries serving the president – instead of a growing bureaucracy pursuing a variety of agendas.[Editor’s note: As a public service all our coronavirus coverage is free. No paywall.]But some former NSC officers from both Republican and Democratic administrations worry that Mr. Trump has cut into the meat of the NSC. The disbanding of the pandemics office in 2018 under John Bolton which was then folded into a broader directorate on issues such as nuclear proliferation and terrorism shows the costs of such downsizing they say.“We live in an era of recurrent crises of this kind [like coronavirus] that come with greater velocity greater impact and cost and we need a facility within ... the White House that has the authority to see around corners see things early act very quickly and bring about accountability and coordination of the U.S. response” says Stephen Morrison director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “That has been missing” with the disbanding of the White House pandemics office.“Some of the sluggishness and confusion that we have seen bedevil this effort since the very beginning ... [is connected to the] absence of effective structures within the White House itself” he adds.That’s because a pandemics office could have filled a vital role from the first moments of the crisis – coordination. Organizations had to spend valuable time getting on the same page.“In a crisis like this you don’t go to HHS [Health and Human Services] and ask them to manage it. You go to the White House where presumably you have the expertise developed to work across all the relevant agencies” says Peter Feaver who was a strategic planner for President George W. Bush’s NSC.“Can you invent it as a posse at the last minute? Yes” he adds “But would it be more effective if it’s already on the spot? Yes. And it could act faster.”Moreover when the pandemics group was moved into a larger directorate it lost expertise. “Amid a pandemic we should prefer a team with sufficient seniority to guarantee access and trust” says Loren DeJonge Schulman the NSC’s director of defense policy during President Barack Obama’s first term. “These are not matters you want to learn on the job in crisis.”The National Institutes of Health leader who has become a fixture at daily White House coronavirus briefings acknowledges the team’s absence is felt. “It would be nice if the office was still there” Dr. Anthony Fauci director of the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases told Congress March 11. What is the NSC for?To Mr. Trump however the NSC had become something that was never intended. National security adviser Robert O’Brien said recently that the NSC had “ballooned” to 250 staff members under President Obama. Mr. O’Brien reduced it to 175 when he took his job and it is now at 110 he added.“The NSC is not there to re-create the State Department or the Pentagon” within the White House he said.But in shrinking the NSC has become too much of a “yes sir” body that tells the president what he wants to hear says Ms. DeJonge Schulman who is now a national security expert at the Center for a New American Security in Washington.“The NSC staff is not there to implement the president’s every desire but to make sure he has the best options evaluation or risk and cost and perspective on agency views” she adds.Some also suspect that the downsizing aims to reduce the number of career officials – the “deep state” – seeing them not as a source of expertise but as a potential den of disloyalty.“It’s just not the case that the NSC O’Brien took over was too big especially given the complexity and variety of issues the president has to deal with” says Mr. Feaver who is now a public policy professor at Duke University in Durham North Carolina. “What is the case is that Trump didn’t think he needed any NSC staff.”Mr. Trump’s impeachment was largely launched by a whistleblower assigned to the White House from an outside agency – the CIA. The president’s preoccupation with “the agencies” suggests to Mr. Feaver that the streamlining “is fueled by the same mindset that gives him concern about the so-called deep state but it reflects a high level of insecurity and a unilateral approach to loyalty.”Golden daysFor his part Mr. O’Brien says he is trying to return the NSC to the model created by the legendary Brent Scowcroft under President George H.W. Bush – a focus on implementing the president’s policies.“If you can’t get on board with [the president] you’re probably better off back in your agency or ... running for Congress” he told a crowd at the Heritage Foundation to laughter.But others have a different view of Mr. Scowcroft’s legacy. Under Mr. Obama National security adviser Susan Rice “believed the NSC staff should focus on coordinating policy and advising the president not implementation that should go to agencies – a fundamentally Scowcroftian view” says Ms. DeJonge Schulman.Ms. Rice too undertook a “right-sizing effort” worried that the NSC had begun taking over agency duties. But the NSC’s key role was “making sure agency perspectives get a fair hearing and fair evaluation with the president” Ms. DeJonge Schulman adds.Beyond that there are limits to a model from three decades ago.“Brent Scowcroft didn’t need an office on cyber but it’s a necessity now” says Mr. Feaver. “In the same way the judgment was made at some point that pandemics were going to become a bigger problem in our current time and so necessitated more high-level attention at the White House.”Politics with respectGet political stories with respectful analysisTo him “that view has been borne out.”
23,White House Congress agree on historic $2 trillion rescue bill,Andrew Taylor Lisa Mascaro and Jonathan Lemire ,The Christian Science Monitor,0,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2020/0325/White-House-Congress-agree-on-historic-2-trillion-rescue-bill,"The White House and Senate leaders of both major political parties announced the agreement early Wednesday on an unprecedented $2 trillion emergency bill to rush sweeping aid to businesses workers and a health care system slammed by the coronavirus pandemic.The urgently needed pandemic response measure is the largest economic rescue measure in history and is intended as a weekslong or monthslong patch for an economy spiraling into recession and a nation facing a deadly toll.Top White House aide Eric Ueland announced the agreement in a Capitol hallway shortly after midnight capping days of often intense haggling and mounting pressure. The deal still needs to be finalized in detailed legislative language.""Ladies and gentlemen we are done"" Mr. Ueland said. ""We have a deal.""The economic rescue package would give direct payments to most Americans expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home.One of the last issues to close concerned $500 billion for guaranteed subsidized loans to larger industries including a fight over how generous to be with the airlines. Hospitals would get significant help as well.""After days of intense discussions the Senate has reached a bipartisan agreement on a historic relief package for this pandemic"" said Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R-Ky. a key negotiator. ""It will rush new resources onto the front lines of our nation's health care fight. And it will inject trillions of dollars of cash into the economy as fast as possible to help American workers families small businesses and industries make it through this disruption and emerge on the other side ready to soar.""At the White House on Tuesday even as the public health crisis deepened President Donald Trump expressed eagerness to nudge many people back to work in the coming weeks and held out a prospect based more on hope than medical science that the country could be returning to normal in less than a month.""We have to go back to work much sooner than people thought"" Mr. Trump told a Fox News town hall. He said he'd like to have the country ""opened up and just raring to go"" by Easter April 12. But in a White House briefing later Mr. Trump said that ""our decision will be based on hard facts and data.""Medical professionals say social distancing needs to be stepped up not relaxed to slow the spread of infections. At the White House briefing the public health authorities said it was particularly important for people in the hard-hit New York City metropolitan area to quarantine themselves for 14 days and for those who have recently left the city to do the same.Dr. Anthony Fauci the government's top infectious disease expert said pointedly at the briefing ""No one is going to want to tone down anything when you see what is going on in a place like New York City.""On Capitol Hill five days of arduous talks produced the bill creating tensions among Congress' top leaders who each took care to tend to party politics as they maneuvered and battled over crafting the legislation. But failure was never an option which permitted both sides to mark big wins.Even before the deal was reached news of the likely but elusive agreement had sent the stock market rocketing on Tuesday. The rescue package would be larger than the 2008 bank bailout and 2009 recovery act combined.The package would give one-time payments of $1200 per adult and $500 per child directly to the public.A huge cash infusion for hospitals expecting a flood of COVID-19 patients grew during the talks at the insistence of Sen. Chuck Schumer the Democratic leader while Republicans pressed for tens of billions of dollars for additional relief to be delivered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency the lead federal disaster agency.Democrats said the package would help replace the salaries of furloughed workers for four months rather than the three months first proposed. Furloughed workers would get whatever amount a state usually provides for unemployment plus a $600 per week add-on with gig workers like Uber drivers covered for the first time.""It ensures that all workers are protected whether they work for businesses small medium or large along with self-employed and workers in the gig economy"" Mr. Schumer said.Republicans won inclusion of an ""employee retention"" tax credit that's estimated to provide $50 billion to companies that retain employees on payroll and cover 50% of workers' paychecks. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax.Democrats pointed to gains for hospitals additional oversight of the huge industry stabilization fund and money for cash-strapped states. A companion appropriations package ballooned as well growing from a $46 billion White House proposal to more than $300 billion which dwarfs earlier disasters – including Hurricane Katrina and Superstorm Sandy combined.To provide transparency the package is expected to create a new inspector general and oversight board for the corporate dollars much as was done during the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program bank rescue officials said.Mr. Trump in recent days has sounded a note of frustration about the unprecedented modern-day effort to halt the virus' march by essentially shutting down public activities in ways that now threaten the U.S. economy.Even though the Trump's administration recommended Americans curtail activities for 15 days starting just over a week ago the Republican president said he may soon allow parts of the economy in regions less badly hit by the virus to begin reopening.He continued on that theme Tuesday as he weighed a relaxation of social distancing guidelines after the 15-day period is up. His suggestion that the pandemic could ease and allow a return to normalcy in a mere few weeks is not supported by public health officials or many others in government.On Tuesday top defense and military leaders warned department personnel that the virus problems could extend for eight to 10 weeks or longer. Army Gen. Mark Milley chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said during a Defense Department town hall meeting that the crisis could even extend into July.Mr. Trump has balked at using his authority under the recently invoked Defense Protection Act to compel the private sector to manufacture needed medical supplies like masks and ventilators even as he encourages them to spur production. ""We are a country not based on nationalizing our business"" said Mr. Trump who has repeatedly railed against socialism overseas and among Democrats."
24,What's holding up $1.8 trillion congressional rescue plan?,Andrew Taylor Jonathan Lemire and Lisa Mascard,The Christian Science Monitor,0,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2020/0323/What-s-holding-up-1.8-trillion-congressional-rescue-plan,"Top-level negotiations between Congress and the White House churned late into the night over a now nearly $2 trillion economic rescue package. As the coronavirus crisis deepened the nation shut down and the first U.S. senator tested positive for the disease.As President Donald Trump took to the podium Sunday in the White House briefing room and promised to help Americans who feel afraid and isolated as the pandemic spreads the Senate voted Sunday against advancing the rescue package. But talks continued on Capitol Hill.“I think you'll get there. To me it's not very complicated: We have to help the worker. We have to save the companies"" Mr. Trump said.Later the president suggested the remedies may be more harmful than the actual outbreak vowing to reassess after the 15-day mark of the shutdown. “WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF” he tweeted.Stock markets remain volatile. In Tokyo shares rose 2 percent while in Europe major indexes were down about 4 percent. Goldman Sachs said on Monday it expected global real GDP to contract by about 1% in 2020 on the back of a 24% drop in the United States in the second quarter a whopping two-and-a-half times as large as the previous postwar record Reuters reported.Inside the otherwise emptied out Capitol the draft aid bill was declared insufficient by Democrats who argued it was tilted toward corporations and did too little to help workers and health care providers. Republicans returned to the negotiating table.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin exiting the Capitol just before midnight struck an optimistic note: “We're very close"" he said adding negotiators would work through the night.“Our nation cannot afford a game of chicken"" warned Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R-Ky. his voice rising on the Senate floor Sunday night. His goal is to vote Monday. The Senate will re-convene at 12 noon EST.Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer D-N.Y also sounded an optimistic note.“This bill is going to affect this country and the lives of Americans not just for the next few days but in the next few months and years - so we have to make sure it is good"" he said. '""There were some serious problems with the bill leader McConnell laid down. Huge amounts of corporate bailout funds without restrictions or without oversight - you wouldn’t even know who is getting the money. Not enough money for hospitals nurses PPE masks all the health care needs. No money for state and local government many of whom would go broke. Many other things.""But Senator Schumer said they were making progress in dealing with those issues. ""We're getting closer and closer. And I’m very hopeful is how I’d put it that we can get a bill in the morning.”With a population on edge and shell-shocked financial markets poised for the new work week Washington labored under the size and scope of the rescue package that's more ambitious than any in recent times - larger than the 2008 bank bailout and 2009 recovery act combined.Democrats say the largely GOP-led effort did not go far enough to provide health care and worker aid and fails to put restraints on a proposed $500 billion “slush fund” for corporations. They voted to block its advance.Democrats won a concession - to provide four months of expanded unemployment benefits rather than just three as proposed according to an official granted anonymity to discuss the private talks. The jobless pay also extends to self-employed and so-called “gig” workers.While the congressional leaders worked into the night alarms were being sounded from coast to coast about the wave of coronavirus cases about to crash onto the nation's health system.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio had dire urgent news from the pandemic’s U.S. epicenter: “April and May are going to be a lot worse” he said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”De Blasio all but begged Washington to help procure ventilators and other medical supplies. He accused the president of “not lifting a finger” to help.Mr. Trump urged Congress to get a deal done and during the Sunday briefing responded to criticism that his administration was sluggish to act. He cited his cooperation with the three states hardest hit - New York Washington and California - and invoked a measure to give governors flexibility in calling up the national guard under their control while the federal government covers the bill.But even as Mr. Trump stressed federal-local partnerships some governors including Republican Greg Abbott of Texas expressed unhappiness with Washington's response. The president himself took a swipe hours earlier at Gov. J. B. Pritzker D-Ill. saying that he and “a very small group of certain other Governors together with Fake News"" should not be “blaming the Federal Government for their own shortcomings.""This came as the first senator Republican Rand Paul of Kentucky announced he tested positive for the coronavirus. Paul who is a doctor and close ally of the president said in a tweet he was not showing symptoms and was in quarantine.Senator Paul was seen at a GOP senators' lunch on Friday and swimming in the Senate gym pool on Sunday morning heightening concerns. His office said he left the Senate immediately after learning his diagnosis.A growing list of lawmakers have cycled in and out of isolation after exposure and two members of the House have said they tested positive. Five senators were in self-quarantine Sunday evening and could not vote.In recent days Mr. Trump invoked the Defense Protection Act a rarely used decades-old authority that can be used to compel the private sector to manufacture needed medical supplies like masks and ventilators. Officials said Sunday that it would be used voluntarily and businesses would not be compelled to act.“We are a country not based on nationalizing our business” said Mr. Trump who has repeatedly railed against socialism overseas and among Democrats.Two days after he lashed out at a reporter who asked about his message to frightened Americans Mr. Trump said ""For those worried and afraid please know as long as I am your president you can feel confident that you have a leader who will always fight for you.”But minutes later when he learned that rival Sen. Mitt Romney R-Utah was one of those in isolation he declared ""Romney's in isolation? Gee that’s too bad.""Mr. Trump said he was not being sarcastic.The urgency to act is mounting as jobless claims skyrocket and the financial markets are set to re-open Monday eager for signs that Washington can soften the blow of the healthcare crisis and what experts say is a looming recession. Stock futures declined sharply as Mr. Trump spoke Sunday evening.Officials late Sunday put the price tag of the ballooning rescue package at nearly $2 trillion. That does not include additional measures being taken by the Federal Reserve to shore up the economy.Treasury Secretary Mnuchin who was leading a third day of nonstop talks on Capitol Hill said the plan was meant to prop up the nation’s weakened economy for the next 10 to 12 weeks.Central to the package is as much as $350 billion for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home. There is also a one-time rebate check of about $1200 per person or $3000 for a family of four as well as the extended unemployment benefits.Hospitals Mr. Mnuchin said will get approximately $110 billion for the expected influx of sick patients.The treasury secretary said a significant part of the package will involve working with the Federal Reserve for up to $4 trillion of liquidity to support the economy with “broad-based lending programs.”But Democrats including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have pushed for add-ons including food security aid small business loans and other measures for workers.They warned the draft plan's $500 billion for corporations does not put enough restraints on business saying the ban on corporate stock buy-backs is weak and the limits on executive pay are only for two years.“We're not here to create a slush fund for Donald Trump and his family or a slush fund for the Treasury Department to be able to hand out to their friends” said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. “We're here to help workers we're here to help hospitals.”Mr. Trump said Sunday he wanted to ensure that any company that received public money couldn't use it to buy back their stock and raise its value.The president when pressed by a reporter dodged a question as to whether his own business would seek federal funds.With Sunday's failed vote Senator McConnell angrily blamed Ms. Pelosi who returned to Washington for a top-level meeting saying she “poured cold water” over the draft plan. But any measure from the Senate also needs to pass the House.The details are coming from drafts of both bills circulating among lobbyists but not yet released to the public. They were obtained by The Associated Press."
25,$1 trillion rescue plan; tax filing deadline moved to July 15,Andrew Taylor Lisa Mascaro and Martin Crutsinger,The Christian Science Monitor,0,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2020/0320/1-trillion-rescue-plan-tax-filing-deadline-moved-to-July-15,"Members of President Donald Trump's economic team convene Friday on Capitol Hill to launch negotiations with Senate Republicans and Democrats racing to draft a $1 trillion-plus economic rescue package amid the coronavirus outbreak.It's the biggest effort yet to shore up households and the United States economy as the pandemic and its nationwide shutdown hurtles the country toward a likely recession.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell unveiled the Republican opening offer to pump $1200 direct checks to taxpayers $300 billion for small businesses to keep idled workers on payroll and $208 billion in loans to airlines and other industries.The GOP leader's effort builds on Mr. Trump's request for Congress to ""go big.""""We need to take bold and swift action as soon as possible"" Mr. McConnell said Thursday announcing his plan on the Senate floor.The 247-page McConnell CARES Act puts the leader's imprint on opening talks with Democrats in Congress as lawmakers prepare to work through the weekend to fast-track perhaps the most urgent legislative undertaking since the 2008 financial crisis.The negotiations are certain to encounter difficulties ahead despite the pressure on Washington to act. Mr. Trump's Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and economic adviser Larry Kudlow will meet behind closed doors with Senate leaders. Democrats say the Republican plan does not go far enough and some Senate Republicans object to certain provisions.""We are beginning to review Senator McConnell's proposal and on first reading it is not at all pro-worker and instead puts corporations way ahead of workers"" said a joint statement from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer.The GOP leader's plan aims to shore up households businesses and the health care industry which is bracing for an expected onslaught of patients falling ill from the virus that causes COVID-19.The one-time $1200 stipends would be sent to individuals – $2400 for couples – phased out at income thresholds of $75000 for individuals and $150000 per couple. Additionally there would be $500 payments for each child.Additionally the McConnell bill would provide $300 billion to small businesses with loans that would eventually be forgiven for employers who use them to meet payroll expenses.To shore up industry Mr. McConnell's plan would provide $208 billion in loans and loan guarantees to distressed sectors including $50 billion for commercial airlines $8 billion for air cargo carriers and $150 billion for other eligible businesses but those loans would have to be paid back.Businesses would also be allowed to defer payment of the 6.2% employer payroll tax.The proposal also includes a specific provision to allow the Treasury secretary to ""participate in the gains"" through stock options or other financial instruments of companies that receive federal aid.At the same time caring for the expected surge of sick Americans is a priority for Congress.The McConnell proposal contains a raft of health care provisions – including permanent liability protection for the manufacturers of respirators and other desperately needed medical gear to handle the pandemic.At the consumer level Mr. McConnell's bill would put into federal law the commitment from insurers that coronavirus tests will be cost-free to policy holders. Additionally the bill requires coverage of coronavirus vaccines at no cost to patients.For the health care industry the bill would establish a new Medicare payment for treating COVID-19 patients. It would suspend through the end of this year a 2% Medicare payment cut to providers under previously set budget restraints.Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer said in statement they looked forward to working with Republicans ""in a bipartisan way to deliver for the American people as soon as humanly possible.""The Democratic leaders said however their priority is to ""make sure all workers are protected from the loss of a paycheck or that no family falls into financial ruin because of this pandemic.""The Democratic leaders called on Mr. Trump to ramp up production of medical supplies and rapidly erect temporary field hospitals under new authorities he has invoked in the Defense Production Act.Keeping paychecks flowing for idled workers as jobless claims skyrocket is a top priority for both Republican and Democratic plans emerging from Congress.But how best to send direct payments to Americans – as one-time stipends ongoing payroll support or unemployment checks – is a crucial debate.Democrats have other ideas for ushering aid to Americans by pushing more money into the existing unemployment insurance system. Mr. Schumer called it ""employment insurance"" – which he characterized as ""unemployment insurance on steroids.""Some GOP senators panned the idea of direct one-time checks preferring instead to use the federal dollars to keep workers who are asked to stay home on business payrolls.""What I want is income not one check"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham R-S.C.Meanwhile industries of all kinds are lining up for help. The total price tag is sure to grow beyond $1 trillion lawmakers said.Mr. Trump has already signed into law a $100 billion-plus bill to boost testing for the coronavirus and guarantee paid sick leave for millions of workers hit by it. Earlier Mr. Trump signed an initial $8.3 billion package from Congress.Income tax filing date moved to July 15The income tax filing date has been pushed back from April 15 to July 15 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said. Mr. Mnuchin announced the decision in a tweet Friday saying that at Mr. Trump's direction ""we are moving Tax Day from April 15 to July 15. All taxpayers and businesses will have this additional time to file and make payments without interest or penalties.""At a White House briefing Mr. Trump said the delay on filing and paying taxes until July 15 was done to give taxpayers more time and ""hopefully by that time people will be getting back to their lives.""Mr. Trump said that if people are expecting refunds they should go ahead and file now so that they can get their refunds from the IRS more quickly.The administration had announced earlier in the week that it would delay the payments a move that Mr. Mnuchin said would leave $300 billion in the economy at a critical time.The administration used authority under Mr. Trump's national emergency declaration. The delay is available to people who owe $1 million or less and corporations that owe $10 million or less.It is expected that many states will follow the lead of the federal government and delay their tax filing deadlines as well but that will be a state by state decision. Mr. Mnuchin had said the payment delay could provide $300 billion in temporary support to the economy by giving households and businesses the ability to use money they would have paid to the IRS as financial support to meet other needs during the economic emergency created by the efforts to contain the coronavirus."
26,US senator sold $1.7M in stock right before stock market dive,Mary Clare Jalonick ,The Christian Science Monitor,0,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2020/0320/US-senator-sold-1.7M-in-stock-right-before-stock-market-dive,Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr R-N.C. sold as much as $1.7 million in stocks just before the market dropped in February amid fears about the coronavirus epidemic.Senate records show that Senator Burr and his wife sold between roughly $600000 and $1.7 million in more than 30 separate transactions in late January and mid-February just before the market began to fall and as government health officials began to issue stark warnings about the effects of the virus. Several of the stocks were in companies that own hotels.The stock sales were first reported by ProPublica and The Center for Responsive Politics. Most of them came on Feb. 13 just before Senator Burr made a speech in Washington D.C. in which he predicted severe consequences from the virus including closed schools and cutbacks in company travel according to audio obtained by National Public Radio and released Thursday.Senator Burr told the small North Carolina State Society audience that the virus was “much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history” and “probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic.”Senator Burr’s remarks were much more dire than remarks he had made earlier in the month for Fox News in an op-ed he coauthored with Sen. Lamar Alexander R-Tenn. assuring Americans that the United States was prepared to meet the public threat of the coronavirus. “Thankfully the United States today is better prepared than ever before to face emerging public health threats like the coronavirus in large part due to the work of the Senate Health Committee Congress and the Trump Administration. The work of Congress and the administration has allowed U.S. public health officials to move swiftly and decisively in the last few weeks. ... All of these steps are part of the response framework Congress has put in place to ensure we are prepared for disease outbreaks and other public health threats.” Despite the timing there is no indication that Senator Burr had any inside information as he sold his stocks and issued private warnings to his wealthy donors. The intelligence panel did not have any briefings on the pandemic the week when most of the stocks were sold according to a person familiar with the matter. The person declined to be identified to discuss confidential committee activity.Senator Burr responded to these reports on Thursday by tweeting that Americans were already being warned about the effects of the virus when he made the speech to the North Carolina State Society.“The message I shared with my constituents is the one public health officials urged all of us to heed as coronavirus spread increased” Senator Burr tweeted. “Be prepared.”Senator Burr sent out the tweets before the reports of his stock sales came out. A spokesperson for the senator said in a statement that Senator Burr “has been deeply concerned by the steep and sudden toll this pandemic is taking on our economy” and supports congressional efforts to help the economy. The spokesperson declined to be identified in order to share the senator’s thinking.The North Carolina senator was not the only lawmaker to sell off stocks just before the steep decline due to the global pandemic. Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler a new senator who is up for re-election this year sold off hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of stock in late January as senators began to get briefings on the virus also according to Senate records.In the weeks that followed Senator Loeffler urged her constituents to have faith in the Trump administration’s efforts to prepare the nation.“@realDonaldTrump & his administration are doing a great job working to keep Americans healthy & safe” Senator Loeffler tweeted Feb. 27.The Daily Beast first reported that Senator Loeffler dropped the stock in late January. The senator is married to Jeffrey Sprecher the chairman and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange which owns the New York Stock Exchange.
27,Three questions as Biden effectively locks down nomination, Linda Feldmann,The Christian Science Monitor,0,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/Politics-Watch/2020/0319/Three-questions-as-Biden-effectively-locks-down-nomination,Dear reader:Joe Biden’s sweep of Tuesday’s primaries effectively seals the Democratic presidential nomination for the former vice president. As I write his only opponent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is “assessing” his campaign and is expected to drop out at some point.For now though both candidates are focused on the COVID-19 pandemic and in live-streamed remarks Tuesday night expressed their concerns and aspirations for Americans at this challenging time.Indeed as James Hohmann of the Washington Post writes “many Americans seem far less interested in partisan politics now than the virus’s potential impact on their lives and their livelihoods.”Still it’s an election year - albeit one filled with uncertainty. Will Senator Sanders work hard to unite his army of disappointed followers behind former Vice President Biden in the effort to defeat President Donald Trump? Will the national party conventions take place this summer - or at all? Will the election itself even happen?On the first question Mr. Sanders promised earlier this month to back Mr. Biden if he’s the nominee but the crisis has only highlighted their differences: Mr. Sanders a democratic socialist is focused on protecting low-income Americans while the center-left Mr. Biden projects a more holistic approach.At the same time Mr. Biden has said he’ll adopt plans from both the Sanders and Elizabeth Warren campaigns on education costs and bankruptcy. The Democratic mainstream has most certainly shifted left. Whether that will be enough to energize Sanders supporters remains to be seen.Which brings the discussion back to President Trump. Even if not inspired by Mr. Biden Sanders supporters can be motivated by the “negative partisanship” of voting against Mr. Trump. The decision Thursday by Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard to drop out and endorse Mr. Biden (and not run as an independent as some feared) reinforced Democratic unity.Perhaps the quadrennial conventions won’t be needed to ramp up partisan enthusiasm. As things looks now with all major gatherings off the table for the foreseeable future a convention-less and rally-free campaign may be in our future. The parties may have to find another way to formally nominate their candidates.
28,Combating an ‘infodemic’: When fear and false information go viral,Christa Case Bryant,The Christian Science Monitor,0,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2020/0318/Combating-an-infodemic-When-fear-and-false-information-go-viral,"One thing quarantines can’t stop is the spread of false information and fear on Facebook and other popular platforms. In the world’s first social media pandemic that presents a parallel set of challenges for citizens and leaders alike.Many have found social media an effective tool for rapidly conveying official guidelines and recommended practices as well as for connecting with each other and supporting the most vulnerable in society. But mixed in has been a torrent of misguided advice and inaccurate claims – including from supposedly scientific studies. This false information has amplified concerns in ways that have made it difficult to ascertain clearly the scope of the global health challenge and how best to address it. The director-general of the World Health Organization has called on governments companies and news outlets around the globe to tackle an “infodemic” of fake news which he characterized as being as dangerous as the coronavirus itself. The U.S. State Department’s foreign propaganda-busting center has compiled a report on some 2 million tweets spreading conspiracy theories about the epidemic concluding that at least some of the activity was due to coordinated campaigns involving fake accounts according to The Washington Post. And amid the swirl of dire predictions a microbiology professor in Spain has deemed this a “pandemic of fear.” “Sometimes a crisis can give us a lot of fear but it can also prompt us to think deeper and to think better” says Kristen Lee a behavioral science professor at Northeastern University in Boston who cautions against “hype contagion.”To avoid the sometimes paralyzing effects of fear she advocates limiting social media consumption and finding opportunities to help others and live in a purpose-driven way. “When we’re using our skills resources and capacities to contribute to the betterment of society” Dr. Lee says “that really is known to elevate and protect our well-being through times of difficulty.”Claudio Furlan/LaPresse/APPeople walk past a billboard reading ""Andra tutto bene"" which is Italian for ""Everything will be alright"" in Milan Italy. Amid a nationwide lockdown to slow the spread of the coronavirus Italians are finding ways to come together virtually in solidarity. This week children’s drawings of rainbows are appearing all over social media as well as on balconies and windows in major cities.From “snake-oil salesmen” to Kremlin disinformationCarl Bergstrom a biologist at the University of Washington says half-jokingly that he was “pre-designed” for this crisis with a background in studying novel infectious diseases as well as how information spreads through networks from ant colonies to Facebook.As he’s monitored false information online about COVID-19 he’s seen everything from anti-China conspiracy theories including the intentional development of coronavirus as a bioweapon to “snake-oil salesmen” peddling fake cures. Those cures have included special toothpaste and potions prompting a spoof from comedian John Oliver who offered “Premium Werewolf Solution” for $49.99.One of the challenges of combating false information is the underlying architecture of social media and the algorithms that drive it.“What goes viral doesn’t have a lot to do with what’s true it has to do with what’s shocking” says Professor Bergstrom who commends social media companies for trying to prevent misinformation from spreading on their platforms. “On the one hand kudos to them for doing that. On the other hand the problem exists in an ecosystem of their making.”In addition to the often well-intentioned sharing of unverified information that turns out to be false another threat is organized disinformation campaigns designed to distract distort and deceive.When the crisis ramped up last week there was a four- to five-day window in which official communication channels were relatively unfettered by such campaigns says Marc Ambinder a digital fellow at the University of Southern California studying disinformation and cybersecurity around elections. But he adds if the number of cases spikes “there’s going to be more anxiety and the purveyors of disinformation in this arms race are going to regain their footing very quickly.”The Trump administration has alleged that a foreign disinformation campaign is underway to sow fear. This past weekend the National Security Council tweeted “Text message rumors of a national #quarantine are FAKE. There is no national lockdown.” Governors and mayors have issued similar missives. And the Pentagon has called out China for spreading “false & absurd conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 blaming U.S. service members.”An internal European Union document describes a “significant disinformation campaign by Russian state media and pro-Kremlin outlets regarding COVID-19” in numerous languages designed to “exacerbate confusion panic and fear” and thereby undermine public trust in authorities and national health care systems. Messages in Spanish for example “advance apocalyptic stories blame capitalists for trying to benefit from the virus and emphasise how well Russia and [President Vladimir] Putin are dealing with the outbreak” according to a Financial Times report.Nicholas Christakis a physician and sociologist at Yale who has become a prominent voice on COVID-19 complained on Twitter of having gained the unwanted attention of lots of Russian bots. “Their intent seems to be to waste my time. Their psychological tricks are incredible” he wrote.Toomas Hendrik Ilves the former president of Estonia which is a leader in countering disinformation responded that attempts to disrupt disinform and dismay are par for the course. He tweeted back “No need to interact. Block.”Nicholas A. Christakis✔@NAChristakisEver since I started tweeting useful and accurate information about coronavirus I seem to have attracted the attention of a lot of Russian bots (with 50 followers and nutty twitter streams). Their intent seems to be to waste my time. Their psychological tricks are incredible.149311:45 PM - Mar 15 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy238 people are talking about thisDealing with fear strengthening one anotherIn this turgid information environment it has been difficult for leaders to find “a healthy balance between conveying calm and being frank about troubling facts” as former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr. advised in a Washington Post op-ed last week. Imparting lessons he learned from helping to steer the nation through the 2008 economic crisis he called fear “as big an enemy as the virus itself.”To be sure minimizing or ignoring information from official sources carries its own dangers and there is disagreement about what constitutes an “appropriate” level of fear. Some say fear spurs people into necessary action. But it can also lead to poor decision-making and unnecessary worry and negatively affect one’s health.“After working for 45 years in the field of psychiatry I have seen fear cause a lot of long-term consequences in people’s lives” says Dr. Mary Moller associate professor of nursing at Pacific Lutheran University in Washington and the 2018 American Psychiatric Nurses Association’s Psychiatric Nurse of the Year. “Ultimately over time it can lead to compromising your immune system.”In addition to mental health professionals’ efforts to help people address their fears faith leaders are also pointing seekers to spiritual sources and encouraging them to minister to their neighbors.“There’s not only a physical toll but there’s a psychological emotional and spiritual toll that we need to be aware of and we need to pray through” says Derwin Gray lead elder-pastor of Transformation Church in Indian Land South Carolina citing scriptural promises of reassurance. “When we are serving other people’s needs that’s when we tend to be the most healthy.”Coming together to work through this crisis could be a catalyst for human progress says virologist Anjeanette Roberts who worked on SARS for three years and serves as a research scholar with Reasons to Believe.“It’s the crises that have the ability to bring out the very best in us because it makes us lay aside what we tend to focus on that can divide us” says Dr. Roberts a public advocate of her Christian faith who is deeply concerned about the level of polarization in American society today. “We have gotten really far away from the idea of ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.’”Now with a global health challenge that has neighbors leaning out their windows and singing together younger people going grocery shopping for their older neighbors little kids leaving drawings in every mailbox in their neighborhood and many other examples of people helping each other some see an opportunity not only to survive the crisis but come out stronger for it.Pastor Gray says “I think it’s putting us in a place of saying ‘Wow maybe I do need a hope and a power and a strength and a love that is beyond me.’”"
29,Statehouse stalemate? After three walkouts Oregon rethinks the rules.,Martin Kuz ,The Christian Science Monitor,0,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2020/0318/Statehouse-stalemate-After-three-walkouts-Oregon-rethinks-the-rules,America’s polarized politics can feel so all-consuming that even recent episodes of unity seem as distant as the Bronze Age. Way back in 2011 Democrats and Republicans in Oregon’s House of Representatives held an equal number of seats as a new legislative session began. The 30-30 split led the parties to elect co-speakers and over the next two years the chamber bustled with cooperation.The bipartisan spirit yielded an overhaul of the state’s health care system major reforms to public education and balanced budgets. Lawmakers agreed to redraw the state’s congressional districts for the first time in a half century. Their willingness to work together resulted in a legislative period that Governing Magazine in 2012 described as “among the most productive in Oregon’s history.”“It was the best session” says Kim Thatcher a Republican who was then in her fifth term in the House. “We still had our differences but we worked on issues that built toward common good common goals.”Such comity appears extinct less than a decade later. Last month Ms. Thatcher now a state senator joined her Republican colleagues in both chambers in boycotting this year’s session to prevent Democrats from advancing a climate initiative to cap greenhouse gas emissions. The 35-day term ended in early March with a grand total of three bills passed out of 258 introduced – a period that surely ranks among the least productive in state history.The walkout by Republicans marked their third in less than a year and the second intended to torpedo a climate measure. Political analysts suggest the scorched-earth tactic while achieving its purpose could deepen public cynicism about the legislature at a time of slumping national confidence in democracy. The exigent question before Oregon lawmakers and voters alike is whether they can agree to disagree on policies yet still resolve statehouse gridlock.“Our political system depends on a willingness to compromise” says Peverill Squire a political scientist at the University of Missouri and an expert on state legislatures. “When that disappears nothing gets done and nobody’s happy and ultimately that can damage trust in the institution.”A ploy with “enormous risk”Oregon is one of four states that requires the presence of more than a simple majority of lawmakers to convene the legislature. The state’s constitution defines a quorum as two-thirds of House or Senate members. Democrats own a supermajority in both chambers but fall two seats shy of that threshold in each one.The imbalance of power – a reflection of Oregon’s shift to the left in recent years – leaves Republicans with few options to stop legislation they oppose. At the same time the decision to walk out in February foiled their own agenda and in the session’s aftermath party leaders admitted to misgivings about the ploy.“I do really really really worry people are going to use this every time they don’t get their way” Sen. Herman Baertschiger Jr. the top Republican in the Senate told reporters. “This is not a good way to run a state.”Both parties have staged walkouts in Oregon since the mid-1990s and lawmakers in Indiana and Wisconsin have resorted to similar protests in the past decade. Compared with previous boycotts in Oregon and elsewhere this year’s action went further with its almost complete scuttling of the legislative agenda.The bipartisan support that existed for various bills – including more funding for wildfire preparedness and a sweeping plan to improve forest management – vanished with Republican legislators who fled the state. The full cost of that all-or-nothing approach could come due at the polls this fall.Democratic lawmakers in Indiana walked out in 2011 to stymie Republican efforts to pass a controversial labor bill and other measures. They returned more than a month later after Republicans tabled the labor proposal. But the next year lingering memories of the boycott contributed to Democrats losing nine seats in the House.Senator Baertschiger has announced he will not seek reelection sparing him potential backlash from voters. His fellow statehouse Republicans could face a wider reckoning in November asserts John Farmer Jr. director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University in New Jersey.“Walking out carries enormous risk” says Mr. Farmer a Republican and former attorney general of New Jersey. “Because once you walk out you not only frustrate the will of the supermajority in the legislature but the majority of the state’s constituents.”On the other hand he adds there remains a chance that voters will instead punish Democrats for again pushing the climate initiative this year given the likelihood of another Republican walkout. The failed gamble deprived the majority party of a chance to pursue high-priority initiatives to ease the state’s homelessness crisis and shortage of affordable housing.As Mr. Farmer says “Voters could be thinking ‘We gave you a supermajority and you still couldn’t accomplish what we wanted you to do. We’re going to throw you out.’ ”Finding a solutionOregon Gov. Kate Brown responded to the fruitless legislative session with an executive order last week that establishes strict guidelines for reducing the state’s greenhouse gas emissions. The Democratic governor’s edict contains many of the elements included in the thwarted climate bill opposed by timber trucking and agriculture interests and Republican lawmakers predict industry groups will sue to block state agencies from enacting the order.Whatever legal battles loom after three legislative walkouts in less than a year public support for finding a solution to avert future boycotts appears on the rise.“There’s been some frustration at what’s gone on” says Jim Moore director of political outreach at the McCall Center for Civic Engagement at Pacific University near Portland. “When a session ends with only three bills passed people notice.”Democratic lawmakers have discussed a pair of resolutions to amend the state constitution that could untie the walkout knot. One would lower the minimum number of members needed for a quorum from two-thirds to a simple majority. If passed the measure would go before voters who would decide whether to bring Oregon in line with nearly every other state.Another proposal would retain the two-thirds threshold while changing the calendar restrictions on legislative sessions.The state constitution limits terms to 35 calendar days in even-numbered years and 160 in odd-numbered years. The “calendar days” proviso enables the minority party to in effect run out the session clock by staying away from the statehouse. The resolution would deter walkouts by stopping the clock on days when a quorum fails to gather.The appeal of either proposal to voters remains unclear as fallout from the boycotts recedes behind concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. “People already have short memories” Mr. Moore says “and even more so now.”In January state Senator Thatcher the longtime Republican legislator who has launched a campaign for secretary of state proposed a resolution to abolish the 35-day sessions outright.The party’s boycott ensured the measure’s demise. Nonetheless recalling those long-ago days of 2011 and 2012 Ms. Thatcher favors a return to a time of more collaboration less brinkmanship.“If we’re going to keep having short sessions they should be used only for policy tweaks budget tweaks emergency issues. Save the big heavy policy debates for the longer sessions” she says. Then another possibility occurs to her. “Or maybe voters can bring back more balance to the legislature.”
30,Biden wins big again; few options left for Sanders,Will Weissert and Brian Slodysko,The Christian Science Monitor,0,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2020/0318/Biden-wins-big-again-few-options-left-for-Sanders,"Joe Biden swept to victory in Florida Illinois and Arizona increasingly pulling away with a Democratic presidential primary upended by the coronavirus and building pressure on Bernie Sanders to abandon his campaign.The former vice president's third big night in as many weeks came on Tuesday amid tremendous uncertainty as the Democratic contest collides with efforts to slow the spread of the virus that has shut down large swaths of American life. Polls were shuttered in Ohio and although balloting went ahead as scheduled in the three other states election workers and voters reported problems.Still Mr. Biden's quest for his party's nomination now seems well within reach. His trio of wins doubled his delegate haul over Mr. Sanders giving the former vice president a nearly insurmountable lead. Top Democratic leaders and donors have also increasingly lined up behind Mr. Biden as the best option to square off against President Donald Trump in November.Using a livestream to address supporters from his home state of Delaware Mr. Biden seemed ready to move past the primary. He paid tribute to the Vermont senator for advancing key issues like affordable health care and combating climate change.""Senator Sanders and his supporters have brought a remarkable passion and tenacity to all of these issues. Together they have shifted the fundamental conversation in this country"" Mr. Biden said. ""So let me say especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders I hear you. I know what's at stake. I know what we have to do.""With the exception of North Dakota and the Northern Mariana Islands Mr. Sanders hasn't scored a victory since Super Tuesday on March 3. He made no immediate move on Tuesday to contact Mr. Biden according to people familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak for the candidates. During remarks early in the night Mr. Sanders said little about the future of the race and instead focused on the coronavirus outbreak.President Donald Trump meanwhile formally clinched the Republican presidential nomination after facing minimal opposition.But much of the action was on the Democratic side where higher vote totals in some key states suggested enthusiasm that even the coronavirus couldn't contain. Turnout in Florida's Democratic primary surpassed the 1.7 million who cast ballots four years ago.Mr. Sanders' path to the nomination is quickly narrowing and some Democrats are now calling on him to drop out in the name of party unity. Top advisers have said he's considering whether the political landscape could look different as the virus continues to reshape life across the country.Still the race increasingly favors Mr. Biden. He maintained strength on Tuesday with African Americans and older voters who have been the hallmark of his campaign. He also appeared to chip away at Mr. Sanders' previous advantage with Hispanics that helped him win Nevada and California early in the race.In Florida Latinos made up roughly 20% of Democratic primary voters and they largely sided with Mr. Biden. The former vice president received the support of 62% of Puerto Rican voters and 57% of Cubans according to AP VoteCast a broad survey of primary voters.The public health and economic havoc wreaked by the coronavirus will nonetheless influence how the presidential contest unfolds.Rallies and other big events have been canceled. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez urged states with upcoming primaries to expand vote-by-mail and absentee balloting as well as polling station hours – trying to ensure the primary isn't further hampered going forward.""The right to vote is the foundation of our democracy and we must do everything we can to protect and expand that right instead of bringing our democratic process to a halt"" Mr. Perez said in a statement.But the damage may have already happened.Four states – Louisiana Georgia Kentucky and Maryland – have joined Ohio in moving to push back their upcoming primaries and others may yet do so. That has left the Democratic primary calendar empty until March 29 when Puerto Rico is scheduled to go to the polls. But island leaders are working to reschedule balloting there too.That means there is nowhere for Mr. Sanders to gain ground on Mr. Biden anytime soon even if he could find a way to mount a sudden surge.At least one of Mr. Sanders' top advisers chided party officials for going forward with voting on Tuesday.""The Democratic Party rightly berates the GOP for ignoring scientists' warnings about climate change"" David Sirota tweeted. ""The same Dem Party just ignored scientists' warnings & pushed to continue in-person elections during a lethal pandemic rather than delaying until there is vote by mail.""There were problems across the country on Tuesday. In Illinois for instance there was a push to relocate about 50 Chicago-area polling places after locations canceled at the last minute.Jim Allen a spokesman for the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners said the board asked Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker last week to cancel in-person voting but the governor refused. Mr. Pritzker countered that state law doesn't give him the authority to make the sweeping changes that elections officials wanted.""Let me tell you this: It is exactly in times like these when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else. And if people want to criticize me for that well go ahead"" the governor said.There weren't problems everywhere though. Mel Dockens a old small-business owner voted in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale and said it was a tough choice. But he went for Mr. Biden because he thought Mr. Sanders' progressive views might turn off some Democratic voters.""It's all about electability"" Mr. Dockens said. ""It's not that I don't trust Bernie Sanders but I trust [Biden] a little more."""
31,What's In It For You? $1200 Checks 13 Weeks Of Unemployment Payments And More,DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN,NPR,0,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/25/821514231/whats-in-it-for-you-1-200-checks-13-weeks-of-unemployment-payments-and-more,"By one projection weekly jobless claims could surpass 2 million in this week's report. By another it could pass 3 million. That's staggering when you consider that at the height of the Great Recession initial claims topped out at just shy of 700000.The CARES Act (short for Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act) that Congress had agreed upon as of midday Wednesday is set to provide $2 trillion in economic aid as the nation braces for this massive economic blow.""Nobody thinks legislation can end this. We cannot outlaw the virus. And no economic policy can fully end the hardship so long as the public health requires that we put so much of our commerce on ice"" said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday. ""This isn't even a stimulus package. It is emergency relief.""For households the two main pillars of relief in the bill are direct payments and unemployment benefits. As of late Wednesday afternoon the expanded unemployment benefits were threatening to hold up the bill's passage.According to experts the sizable spending for individuals as laid out in the bill's latest version will help protect Americans from severe economic pain but some question whether it's enough for the long run.Relief checks for most AmericansA lot of the attention is being paid to the one-time checks that households will receive directly from the government.The final version of the bill aims to send a $1200 check to every adult earning up to $75000 — or $2400 for joint tax filers earning up to $150000 — plus $500 for every child they have. Around 90% of households would benefit from the checks according to the Tax Policy Center.The check amounts would be phased out beyond those income limits and no person earning over $99000 (or couple earning over $198000) would receive the benefits. (However unlike earlier versions there are no phase-in amounts; all individuals with incomes up to $75000 will receive the same amount.)What $1200 buysPut into perspective $1200 is a bit more than the median full-time U.S. worker gets per week — $936 as of the end of 2019.It's also a potentially sizable cushion for some households. More than 1 in 10 adults wouldn't be able to cover an emergency $400 expense and an additional 1 in 4 would need to borrow money or sell something according to 2018 data from the Federal Reserve.But what would $1200 cover? We do know that housing is for many households the largest spending category. Median rent in the U.S. in 2017 was $1012 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Median mortgage costs meanwhile were $1513 for households with a mortgage.On average a one-person household bought around $370 worth of food per month in 2018. A three-person household spent around $750 per month. So a $1200 check would go a long way toward purchasing food.Of course household needs differ dramatically by place and size. Median rent in San Francisco is $2200 whereas it is $1091 in Phoenix and $891 in Omaha Neb. And a family needing more space might pay a much higher mortgage or rent than a single person.But the point is that Congress is acting quickly says one political scientist. And these initial rebate checks are a simple blunt way to start helping some households.""We're living in an emergency situation. In an ideal world we would have time to create adjusted cost-of-living amounts for everywhere in the country based on pretty specific data as to what it costs to raise what type of children you know which number of children and which state"" said Amy Castro Baker a professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies basic-income programs. ""We don't have that kind of time. People are losing their houses yesterday.""In short $1200 (or $2400 for a two-adult household) could in the immediate future be useful for a lot of people. But then the crisis could last much longer — some public health experts say the need for social distancing could easily last for months.That's where longer-term measures such as the unemployment insurance measures in this bill will help.Some low-wage workers could get more than their usual earningsThe expansion of unemployment benefits could stand to put even more money in some families' pockets than the stimulus checks. New York Sen. Chuck Schumer has taken to calling it ""unemployment insurance on steroids.""""I think of this thing as a deep response and a broad response"" said Chuck Marr senior director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. While the ""broad"" part is the checks he said ""unemployment is a sort of deep response. People are losing jobs; they're hurt; they need help.""The latest versions of the bill expand unemployment benefits across several dimensions. First the bill would extend regular unemployment benefits to last an additional 13 weeks. In most states laid-off workers can get a maximum of 26 weeks of benefits.The bill would also add four months of $600 weekly payments on top of the usual weekly unemployment checks. That is a large bump compared with usual unemployment benefits. According to the Labor Department the average weekly benefit as of the end of February was about $372.It's also a large increase in benefits compared with those during the Great Recession when the economic stimulus act added $25 to weekly unemployment checks.Altogether an additional $600 on top of those average benefits would equal roughly 100% wage replacement for average workers — meaning some lower-income workers will get more than their usual wages from this expansion.On top of that the latest versions of the bill would expand who can get unemployment to people who wouldn't otherwise be eligible for benefits such as the self-employed and those in isolation or quarantine because of the virus.This expansion of unemployment benefits threatened to hold up the bill's passage Wednesday afternoon as a group of Republican senators objected to the new unemployment provisions.""We cannot encourage people to make more money in unemployment than we do in employment"" South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott told reporters on Capitol Hill on Wednesday.There's also some question as to how much economic pain these proposals wouldn't protect people from. After all the scars from this economic blow could last far longer than the four months that the $600 unemployment bump will last.The package also contains far more than just this assistance for households. There are also loans for small businesses and provisions to make much of that loan money forgivable. The bill also would allow federal student loan borrowers a grace period from making payments until October."
32,Senate Coronavirus Bill Includes $400 Million To Protect Elections,PAM FESSLER,NPR,0,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/25/821521543/senate-coronavirus-bill-includes-400-million-to-protect-elections,"The Senate coronavirus relief bill now under consideration would give states $400 million to protect upcoming elections against the pandemic threat. The money far less than the $4 billion some Democrats had wanted would allow states to expand mail-in and early voting as well as online voter registration. The money could also be used to help secure in-person voting sites.Primaries and other elections have been postponed in more than a dozen states so far because of concerns about the coronavirus. Several states – including Ohio Georgia and West Virginia – have announced that they will send absentee ballot applications to all registered voters so they do not have to vote in person.The package does not require states to offer 15 days of early voting no-excuse absentee voting and other changes some Democrats had sought. Congressional Republicans as well as state officials oppose imposing federal requirements on elections which are traditionally run by the states.""There is no one size fits all approach but instead a 50-state solution"" Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate a Republican and New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver a Democrat wrote Wednesday in an open letter on behalf of the National Association of Secretaries of State. ""We ask Congress to recognize the necessity for flexible funding to meet each of our specific needs.""David Stafford the supervisor of elections in Escambia County Fla. said he was grateful the money had few restrictions. ""Flexibility is the key in this because what works for one state in responding to this current situation is going to be different than other states"" he said.But Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Ron Wyden said in a statement that they will continue to push legislation to require that states make no-excuse mail-in voting available to all voters and to provide more early voting and other options.""While this funding is a step in the right direction we must enact election reforms across the country as well as secure more resources to guarantee safe and secure elections"" they said.The Brennan Center for Justice in New York estimates that at least $2 billion is needed for election offices to respond adequately to the pandemic. This includes the cost of printing and mailing millions of additional mail-in ballots in the coming months. The center estimates that postage alone could run in excess of half a billion dollars."
33,A Grounded Biden Campaign Is Trying To Reach Voters In The Cloud,ASMA KHALID,NPR,0,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/25/820741876/a-grounded-biden-campaign-is-trying-to-reach-voters-in-the-cloud,"Joe Biden is a classic retail politician — a man who loves to shake hands give hugs take selfies and look voters directly in the eye one-on-one. But now he can't do any of those things.Instead because of the coronavirus outbreak his campaign is grounded: no rallies no travel. It's all virtual fundraisers live-streamed speeches remote TV interviews Facebook videos and volunteer Slack channels.Behind the scenes the former vice president spends hours a day on the phone with his public health advisory committee fellow Democratic leaders and economic advisers but the public-facing campaign is now exclusively a TV and digital operation.The coronavirus outbreak has forced the 77-year-old Biden and his campaign to urgently reckon with a new reality in which the internet is the main campaign battlefield — a place where they have often been outdone by rivals but where voters are currently very much a captive audience.The things that will make us successful now are the things that are gonna make us successful in the general. It just means that we need to do them faster"" said Rob Flaherty Biden's digital director.Biden is not officially the Democratic nominee but given his large delegate lead and the momentum from a string of major primary victories before voting was largely suspended he is widely seen as the prohibitive front-runner.Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has not conceded and in fact maintains a robust digital operation through which he's given competing digital appearances in recent days.Sanders is seen as a sort of pioneer in the world of campaign live streaming. Biden was a late adopter.His first virtual town hall suffered a technical glitch preventing most people from watching it in real time. Then last week Biden was slow to reappear on camera after the March 17 primaries doing no TV appearances and just one telephone press conference. The lack of visibility led to some mockery from Sanders supporters and frustration from some allies.During a virtual fundraiser over the weekend one donor asked: ""What I'm concerned about is that we see Donald Trump every day with this crisis giving his press report. And I would just love to see you more. Like how do we get more of you and less of him on our airwaves?""Biden's answer seemed apparent by Tuesday: multiple TV interviews all done through a new in-home studio installed in a rec room at his house in Delaware.But unexpectedly scaling a full digital operation is no easy feat.""I think the next weeks or months however long it is are going to be really challenging for every campaign"" said Teddy Goff digital director for Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign. ""I also think there's a huge opportunity: Everyone in America is sitting in front of their device all day and all night.""The challenge he says is finding the right way to reach voters.""People are going to have to figure out what time people are paying attention to and what channels work best and what are the tactics you can get to get people to tune in"" he said.Beyond the logistical details Goff says there's another hurdle in this moment where everything is overshadowed by crisis: getting a message across. ""People who are not in public office have to figure out how they can contribute effectively to the conversation you know give people news they can use"" he said.Biden's campaign is experimenting trying to figure out how to recreate the feel of retail politics without the crowds. Over the weekend the former vice president popped into a quarantine Instagram party hosted by DJ D-Nice.Fighting on Trump's turfThe campaign sees Facebook as a friendly space. But that's also one of Donald Trump's preferred social media outlets. The president has far more followers with 28 million on his page compared to roughly 1.7 million for Biden. A random Facebook video the president posts can easily receive half a million views.But while Trump's videos might receive a lot of eyeballs often drawn to provocative rhetoric the Biden campaign believes its strength is empathy and explanation. It's taking cues from the unexpected success of a video from early January with Biden delivering remarks about Iran and Trump's actions in the region which received over 600000 views on Facebook.The campaign also pointed to four of its videos in recent days that have over a million views on Twitter including a COVID-19 explainer with Biden adviser and former Obama administration Ebola czar Ron Klain in front a white board — it's received over 4 million views.Biden not known for the massive crowds or internet success of Trump and Sanders seems intrigued by the potential reach.""The irony is — virtual campaigning — I'll probably reach more people than I would out there shaking hands"" he said in an interview with ABC's The View on Tuesday morning.A ground game in the cloudIt's one thing for the candidate himself to continue campaigning and another for his volunteers and organizers to build up a ground organization in key states when they're not allowed to physically knock on doors or meet in large groups.Matthew Plourd a freshman at New York University is part of a student group supporting Biden. His organization had been planning on hosting a debate night watch party and canvassing New Yorkers in Washington Square Park. Since in-person classes have been cancelled he's been at home in Connecticut trying to spread the word via his cellphone and coordinating with other members of the group Students for Biden.""We have a national Slack that we all talk on that we're all fairly active on"" said Plourd referencing the messaging service also used by many businesses.Plourd says the new environment is challenging but he's actually seen social media engagement go up since students have been off campus as internet traffic has surged across the board.""You can attribute that to a lot of things obviously people spending more time on the web while they're at home bored"" he said.Many upcoming primaries are postponed and so phone banking to get out the vote isn't an immediate concern. Volunteers still gather on the video platform Zoom or chat through messaging sites such as Slack as Plourd mentioned; but Biden's campaign views organizing in this moment as a way to create community more than fulfill an immediate campaign need.Bringing voters together while apart""Campaigns are very much social activities for a lot of people"" said Paul Ruiz a volunteer with the Biden campaign in Virginia. Prior to the virus outbreak he held weekly phone banks and watch parties but now he's had to move all of that over to virtual platforms.This past weekend he helped organize a remote phone bank via Zoom. Calling voters via a communal camera he admits can be ""awkward"" so it was less about the actual work of dialing numbers together and more about the camaraderie recreating the casual side-conversations volunteers have when they're making calls in a room together.""The purpose of the Zoom is really to bring everybody together and retain the social element of campaigns"" said Ruiz. ""This past weekend the conversation was on who should be Joe Biden's vice presidential pick.""Phone banking tools already exist online and prior to the pandemic people could already easily access the dial-in logistics from their own homes but Ruiz says they often preferred to come to a phone-banking session so that they could talk to politically like-minded friends.""Online organizing around this sense of building communities and getting those communities to take action that was always going to be the plan"" said Biden digital director Flaherty. ""Now that people are home and looking for connection it means we got to do that sooner.""In other words they are beefing up a digital operation they would need for a general election but they're doing it in a strange moment."
34,Amid Pandemic Crisis U.S. Wages Broader Messaging War With China,FRANCO ORDOÑEZ,NPR,0,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/25/820218457/amid-pandemic-crisis-u-s-wages-broader-messaging-war-with-china,"The United States and China are locked in a struggle over influence and messaging about the coronavirus pandemic even as governments around the world struggle to control the outbreak.This week Washington claimed a small victory.State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus hailed comments by China's ambassador walking back an earlier false claim in Beijing that the U.S. Army had introduced the coronavirus to its epicenter in the Chinese city of Wuhan.Morgan Ortagus✔@statedeptspoxWe welcome Ambassador Cui's comments calling the Chinese Foreign Ministry's statement a “crazy thing” that blamed the U.S. Army for the #coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan. Saving lives is more important than saving face.17989:44 AM - Mar 24 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy842 people are talking about thisHer statement was part of what the Trump administration says is a coordinated effort to push back on a disinformation campaign by the Chinese communist government.A senior administration official tells NPR that the United States has warned the communist government against suppressing accurate information. Trump is sending that message too.""I'm a little upset with China. I'll be honest with you"" Trump told reporters last Sunday charging that Beijing should have alerted authorities earlier and allowed U.S. experts to analyze findings about the coronavirus.The Cold War-like spat has waxed and waned by the day depending on the public remarks of officials in both governments.But the background throughout has been the desire of each power to position itself as the leader of the response. As Trump and aides talked up their discussions with G7 allies China's messaging to Europeans was that their most meaningful support including in the form of aid to European countries hobbled by the outbreak is coming not from the West but the east.As Trump and his aides faulted China's repressive regime for squelching dissent and information Beijing's spokesmen fired right back including with mockery and with false allegations such as the ""Army"" claim.For some specialists imposing a geostrategic superstructure onto a public health crisis in this way is counterproductive.Bonnie Glaser a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies says the blame game has become a distraction from the real work that needs to take place.""At this point it seems to me to be quite a waste of energy for the U.S. and Chinese governments to be focused on that question when they should be working hard on protecting their own citizens contributing where they can to help other countries around the world that are very ill prepared to deal with this virus"" Glaser said.A tale of two systemsIn the telling of Trump and some Republican supporters the pandemic is the fault of an oppressive Chinese Communist Party that pressured underlings and suppressed free expression so much that the virus raged for too long within China with too little warning for the world.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo complained to reporters that disinformation about the virus — which he said was coming from China Russia and Iran among other apparent sources — hurt public health efforts and corroded trust.The Trump administration isn't casting blame for the virus but it does want to ensure that accurate data sets are shared with public health officials who continue to fight the spread he said.Tara O'Toole a former undersecretary for Homeland Security under President Obama said she thought finger pointing is counterproductive. But she did agree that information is critical in a global era that makes epidemics likelier and deadlier.Outbreaks such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome H1N1 influenza and Zika are happening because of expanding trade and travel patterns.""These epidemics are going to keep coming"" said O'Toole who is now executive vice president at In-Q-Tel a venture capital firm closely linked to the national security establishment.""We have that to get much better at handling them. So understanding what really happened from whence these viruses originate and how to fight them is important for the whole world at the same time"" she said.At the same time if the coronavirus crisis has underscored the new risks associated with a closely connected globe some insiders also say it has exposed specific challenges associated with the bilateral dynamic between the U.S. and China.Tim Morrison who formerly led biodefense issues at the National Security Council in the Trump administration said the crisis has exposed the critical American dependence on Chinese manufacturing including of medical supplies and specialized respirator masks that are now scarce.Trump's polices already had complicated the economic relationship between China and the U.S. before the coronavirus disaster — and Morrison said the crisis now will force Washington to try to evolve that relationship again to stanch Chinese production of so many vital products.""One of the tough choices we have to make is we are going to have to figure out how to uncouple or decouple our pharmaceutical our health care commodity supply chain from China because we have seen the bulk of it move to China"" said Morrison who is now a fellow at the Hudson Institute.The problem – Morrison warns – is China is in control of these and other vital products which might give it a veto over access to them.The United States and the West grew to depend on Asia as a reliable manufacturer of nearly everything but for Morrison and other skeptics the question posed by the outbreak is whether Washington can live in a world in which its supplies are at Beijing's mercy.Beijing touts its own leadershipChina's leaders reject these kinds of charges but they have embraced the battle with America over global messaging.In the view from Beijing quick and stringent action made possible by China's unique system quashed the virus.President Xi Jinping already has taken what amounted to a victory lap through Hubei Province where the coronavirus outbreak originated and pointed to China's success in flattening its curve of new infections after a broad crackdown there.China is one of only two countries so far along with South Korea that have proceeded up and then down its curve of infections. New cases continue growing everywhere else.Official messaging by spokesmen such as Hua Chunying of the foreign ministry also has embraced what China calls the aid it has given to Italy the European epicenter of the pandemic and China's preparedness for global leadership.Hua's posts also have become a meta-commentary about the messaging war itself including with links to stories about the American desire to criticize Beijing.""Saving lives is more important than saving face! Be honest and responsible!"" Hua wrote.China's global messaging is not only deliberate but focused: Twitter is banned inside the people's republic; the intended audience for these messages are outsiders and nations such as those in Europe that China's leaders have selected.Reverberations within the U.S.American officials' complaints about Chinese communists' repression have become muddled and intermingled with what critics call racist or ethnocentric language including that used by Trump himself.But if the United States won a minor victory in the messaging war this week so in this context did China.After a stream of news conferences in which Trump insisted upon using the term ""Chinese virus"" the president ditched that phrase on Monday.Trump hasn't abandoned his complaint about how much information he says China's government concealed about the early phase of the coronavirus outbreak but he did abandon the phrase ""Chinese virus.""The president told Fox News in an interview on Tuesday that he didn't regret using that term — ""but I decided we shouldn't make any more of a big deal out of it."""

The way the two countries responded however was very different.South Korea quickly got tests out which is being credited with helping flatten the country's curve of its coronavirus outbreak; the United States moved far more slowly taking weeks to ramp up testing.Now the United States has tested more than 300000 people government officials touted Tuesday noting it had passed South Korea in the raw number of tests conducted.""In a short period of time we've done more testing than South Korea"" President Trump said on an appearance on Fox News Tuesday. Trump added ""We're going up proportionally very rapidly.""But South Korea has a population of just 51 million people; the United States has 327 million.At about 300000 tests in each country that means South Korea has tested 1-in-170 people; the United States: 1-in-1090.That's more than six times less per capita than South Korea."
36,House Lawmakers Weigh Voting By Proxy To Maintain Social Distancing,CLAUDIA GRISALES,NPR,0,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/24/820943132/house-lawmakers-weigh-voting-by-proxy-to-maintain-social-distancing,"As the impacts of coronavirus spread among its own membership House lawmakers are weighing alternatives to a longtime tradition to in-person voting as they near a potential major vote on a new emergency bill.Among the top considerations: proxy voting. A new House Rules Committee plan rolled out this week suggests that maybe the preferred route if members want to skip out on in-person votes.""There is currently no perfect solution to allow absent Members to vote on the floor"" the new 23-page report says. ""However proxy voting is likely the best of the options available under the circumstances.""Proxy voting which would allow one member to submit votes on behalf of many of their colleagues has precedent before congressional committees. The plan would need significant buy-in from Democrats and Republicans but could have the best shot at broad support.The House last met on Saturday March 14 to approve a second wave of funding to respond to the coronavirus crisis. Hours later two members fell sick from the illness which led to self-quarantines for nearly a dozen more members.The House since left for a recess that has been extended with calls urging leadership to consider options such as remote voting — a move congressional leaders have long resisted.The House Rules Committee said technology and security requirements for remote voting would take extensive time to implement and couldn't be installed in time for the next House vote.However alternatives such as proxy voting could be implemented quickly. Another option — unanimous consent — has the most precedent on the House floor the committee said. It was also used during the 1918 pandemic.Unanimous consent is traditionally used as a verbal OK on the House floor to approve noncontroversial legislation. But all of the chamber's more than 430 members would have to agree — a very tall order for the House.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi says unanimous consent could be a possibility to approve a $2 trillion emergency aid bill if it gains approval in the Senate and moves to the House.""For right now we're just working very hard to get unanimous consent so we can get this bill done and then consider what the options are later"" Pelosi said on MSNBC on Tuesday."
37,Pelosi Says There Is 'Real Optimism' Over Coronavirus Financial Package,SUSAN DAVIS KELSEY SNELL CLAUDIA GRISALES,NPR,0,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/24/820629162/pelosi-says-there-is-real-optimism-over-coronavirus-financial-package,"Updated at 1:27 p.m. ETA Senate agreement on a third wave of emergency funding to address the coronavirus could be ""hours"" away House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Tuesday as Republicans and Democrats seemed close to bridging disagreements that have stalled a deal on the approximately $2 trillion package.""I think there is real optimism we could get something done in the next few hours"" Pelosi said in an interview on CNBC.She said she was pleased by the plan's new provisions such as new oversight of funds that could be distributed to larger industries hit hard by the pandemic and support to local and state governments.She said Democratic negotiations have also made progress in blocking moves to fund corporate buybacks CEO pay and other concerns.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor that negotiators were in the process of working out a few remaining issues which he expects will be resolved within hours.Among the changes he said Democrats have secured is a major expansion of the Unemployment Insurance program. Schumer said he expects the bill will provide four months of full salary payments for people who lose their jobs because of the coronavirus.""What it says is if you lose your job in this crisis you can be furloughed by your employer"" Schumer said. ""You stay on that employer's work list. If you have health benefits with that employer. you can keep getting them. But and most importantly the federal government will pay your salary your full salary for now four months.""The proposal would allow more people to qualify for unemployment including those who are furloughed freelancers and other contract or gig employees according to a Democratic aide familiar with the negotiations. It would work by increasing the benefit by $600 a week for four months on top of the weekly rate states give as a base for unemployment assistance.The plan would expand existing unemployment by 13 weeks meaning people who are nearing the point where they would max out their access to the program would have their time extended the aide said.The potential for a deal was good news for U.S. stocks that have been battered by the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up nearly 10% at noon.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R-Ky. echoed the optimism saying he believes a deal can be reached Tuesday.""We're on the 5-yard line. It's taken a lot of noise and a lot of rhetoric to get us here"" he said. ""If we act today what Americans will remember and what history will record is that the Senate did the right thing.""Earlier Pelosi acknowledged there were some details to hammer out but said they aren't ""deal-breakers"" and include a call for new worker protections and expanded medical leave.""I think we are getting to a good place if they stay there — the problem is it moves"" she said of the legislation's changes. She said she hopes the House could approve the bill under unanimous consent but if that's not possible they can call members back to amend the Senate bill or pass their own proposal and go to conference to hammer out a final bill.""The easiest way to do it is for us to come to put aside some of our concerns for another day and get this done"" Pelosi said.However she said an ultimate deal is within reach.""We think the bill has moved sufficiently to the side of workers"" Pelosi said. She later added ""I think we are on a good track.""Tuesday's optimism was in sharp contrast to Monday's back-and-forth in the Senate. House Democrats had introduced their own proposal which a House Democratic aide said was valued at $2.5 trillion and focused on boosting health care access unemployment insurance the health care industry and payments to workers.McConnell had blamed Democrats on Monday for delaying progress on the bill even as Democrats continued to negotiate with White House officials.The Senate majority leader called for the Senate to support a GOP-drafted bill that includes expanded unemployment insurance aid for small businesses and loans for large corporations.""The American people have had enough of this nonsense.

38,Trump Sets Easter Goal For Reopening American Economy,PHILIP EWING BARBARA SPRUNT,NPR,0,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/24/820774378/trump-id-love-for-u-s-to-be-opened-up-by-easter-amidst-pandemic-response,"Updated at 7:35 p.m. ETIn his Tuesday afternoon briefing with the coronavirus task force President Trump couched earlier comments about the need to reopen the U.S. economy within weeks emphasizing that the decision would ultimately be data driven and made in consultation with public health experts.The president said he still wants Americans working again by Easter Sunday something he first said during a virtual town hall with Fox News earlier in the day. But he was much more circumspect over whether that would be possible from a medical standpoint.His previous comments about reopening the economy prompted alarm among public health experts across the country who said it's far too early. Trump seemed to much more carefully toe the line during his briefing as he talked about ""carefully and responsibly reopening the country.""""I want to assure Americans that we have a team of public health experts ... also economists and other professionals working to develop a sophisticated plan to reopen the economy as soon as the time is right one based on the best science the best modeling and the best medical research there is anywhere on earth"" he said.Trump stressed that this is a ""medical crisis — this isn't a financial crisis.""In the Fox News TV special earlier Tuesday Trump said he ""would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter.""That's April 12 within the timeline of ""weeks"" that Trump said he hopes is appropriate for curtailing the social distancing isolation and other measures that officials have outlined to slow the spread of the coronavirus — but that have also paralyzed the economy.During the briefing officials also recommended that people who have recently left the New York City metro area should self-quarantine for the next 14 days to ensure the virus doesn't spread.The rate of infections inside the U.S. has not stopped climbing — by Tuesday afternoon there were more than 50000 confirmed cases nationwide according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University — and Trump's April 12 target date is far sooner than other milestones set by officials across the country.The District of Columbia has closed its schools through April 24 for example; schools in Virginia won't reconvene at all for the rest of this academic year.Trump and Vice President Pence have talked up what they call the need for the U.S. to reset in stride as military commanders might say — to continue some mitigation measures to constrain the pandemic but also permit some businesses to reopen.""You can destroy a country this way by closing it down"" Trump said in the Fox special on Tuesday.The president and vice president framed one focus for the upcoming months on the most vulnerable populations particularly older people with preexisting medical conditions.Under this construction life might shift away from keeping everyone apart to permitting more people to leave their homes and return to work. For the time being Trump said Americans might still be discouraged from shaking hands and other such activity. ""We can socially distance ourselves and go to work"" he said.At the same time as Pence described it the national response would shift from one based on dispersing everyone to defending the elderly although it isn't clear whether public health officials agree or what new steps that might require.Supply updateDuring the task force briefing Pence also spoke about FEMA's effort to identify personal protective equipment and ventilators.As of Tuesday FEMA is distributing 7.6 million N95 respirator masks more than 14 million surgical masks and has already shipped 73 pallets of personal protective equipment to New York Pence said.Pence also reflected on what he called an ""inspiring"" response of businesses around the country who are mobilizing on the production of critical supplies.""We see industry stepping up"" Pence said.""We heard the McDonald's is now offering curbside delivery to truckers who are unable to use the Drive-Thru to pick up a Big Mac.""Pence also said he's been in talks with Tim Cook of Apple whose company is donating 9 million N-95 masks to health care facilities across the country and to the national stockpile.Partway through isolationThe United States is nine days into a 15-day period of White House guidelines to ""slow the spread"" of the virus. When that ends the administration will begin to assess whether to recommend more isolation and mitigation — or to permit some people to work or travel as Trump has suggested.It isn't clear what metrics the White House might use when making that assessment and the challenge of moving out of this isolation phase is compounded by the unequal affliction of the coronavirus across the country.Washington state California and New York state have been hit particularly hard but aren't moving through their rates of infection at the same rate.Dr. Deborah Birx leader of the White House's coronavirus response task force says Washington state is about two weeks ahead of New York for example.The White House has acknowledged that many of the important upcoming decisions about the pandemic belong to governors or local officials. Trump and Pence have come under pressure however to at least give broad expectations about when life can start to get back to normal.In recent days the president has taken on board the idea that too much isolation and too much mitigation could be too ruinous for the economy saying the ""cure"" can't be worse than the disease.""We have a pent-up energy that's going to be unbelievable"" Trump said.The president said he wants to be mindful about the need to balance public health interests with the desire to reopen America for business but he also suggested that public health officials might be too conservative.""I'm sure we have doctors who say 'Let's keep it closed for two years' "" Trump said. ""No we've got to get it open — our people want it open and that's the way this country was built.""Trump appeared in a separate interview on Fox on Tuesday and described a scene he had imagined in which millions of worshippers were able to attend Easter services next month.""Wouldn't it be great to have all of the churches full?"" Trump said noting that churches have been forced to move online because of social distancing guidelines.""Online is never going to be like being there"" he said. ""You're going to have packed churches all over our country. I think it would be a beautiful time.""Call for consensus on legislationTrump and Pence called for Congress to complete work on the relief and stimulus legislation that has been under negotiation for the past several days but they also faulted Democrats for what they called opportunism about the bill.""All of a sudden they started to throw the Green New Deal stuff in — 'we want green energy' "" Trump said.The president dislikes wind turbines after a dispute over the prospect that they might be installed near a golf course he owns in Scotland and Trump suggested on Tuesday that Democratic support for wind energy might have caused him to reject some of the proposals in the bill.""They had things in there that were terrible — windmills all over the place ... windmills that kill the birds and ruin the real estate right?"" Trump said.Washington must focus on ""the workers"" the president said. ""Workers first.""Trump said in his second interview on Fox that he wasn't concerned about the costs associated with what could be a $2 trillion stimulus package because he considered that to be an investment.""It's not really spending because a lot of it is helping companies"" through loans he said. ""It's loaded to save corporations"" he said specifically mentioning Boeing.""They're going to pay that back"" he said noting that some may pay by giving the government some equity and also by repaying with interest.""We're going to get stock for the taxpayers of our country"" Trump said."

""And I think in any time we face a situation like that there's going to be kind of an explosion in information. And not all of that is going to be credible and accurate information.""Part of the blame for the ease with which rumors and bad information spreads is due to social media Webb says.""So many people rely on it to communicate with friends and family members. And it's for many people a primary source of information"" he says. ""But at the same time we know that social media can also be bombarded with inaccurate information.""Swimming with the sharksSome of the misinformation that spreads in times of crisis is less than harmful.There were rumors claiming sharks were swimming in the streets during Hurricane Florence — perhaps the inspiration for recent false claims that dolphins were spotted frolicking in the canals of Venice because the water was now clean due to a coronavirus-related lack of boat traffic.It's not clear where much of this material originates although Trump administration officials have blamed foreign governments.""What we know — whether it's Russia or whether it's other cyber actors... [is] they like to sow discord on any controversial issue"" Wolf said on another Fox show. ""So it doesn't just have to be elections. It can be any issue. And we're seeing that now with the coronavirus.""Trump himself was angered that a spokesman for China's foreign ministry falsely alleged that the U.S. Army had introduced the coronavirus to Wuhan its original epicenter in China.Webb isn't convinced much of misinformation that spreads in crises has sinister origins saying much of it ""stems from some inconsistent messaging that's coming out about the virus. And I think that inconsistency is really happening at all levels.""FEMA he says is ""trying to reduce some of those inconsistencies and also reduce some of the confusion and ambiguity"" with its website.Hucksters and flimflamA related problem: In a crisis there are always those who try to illegally cash in.Another myth that FEMA is rebuking holds that the government is currently mailing out $1000 checks to Americans. Although members of Congress are debating relief legislation the particulars aren't yet final.FEMA says: ""The U.S. government is not mailing checks in response to COVID-19 at this time. Anyone who tells you they can get you the money now is a scammer.""Attorney General William Barr vowed at the White House on Monday that the Justice Department would crack down on coronavirus scammers.That followed action by the department to shut down a website that was offering what it called a vaccine kit — a fraud. Although early clinical tests are underway today there is no vaccine.The Justice Department alleged that the operators of the website were running a wire fraud scheme to profit off of the fear around the COVID-19 pandemic. A federal judge in Texas has granted the department's request for the website to be temporarily blocked as the case proceeds.NPR's Ryan Lucas contributed to this report."
40,FACT CHECK: Trump Compares Coronavirus To The Flu But It Could Be 10 Times Deadlier,DOMENICO MONTANARO,NPR,0,https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/24/820797301/fact-check-trump-compares-coronavirus-to-the-flu-but-they-are-not-the-same,"In arguing for returning the country to some kind of normal sooner rather than later President Trump noted that 36000 people on average die from the flu each year.""But we've never closed down the country for the flu"" the president said during an appearance on Fox News on Tuesday. ""So you say to yourself 'What is this all about?' ""But the two really can't be compared. They are very different and present different kinds of dangers. Here's how they are different per a story done four days ago by Pien Huang a reporter on NPR's Science Desk who covers global health and development:1. COVID-19 is novel or new. That means there's no vaccine and it's unclear how it will manifest;2. This strain of coronavirus appears to infect two to 2.5 people versus 1.3 with the flu so coronavirus seems to be about twice as contagious as the flu;3. Some 20% of coronavirus patients are in serious enough condition to go to the hospital 10 times the number who wind up in the hospital because of the flu;4. Hospital stays for the coronavirus are twice as as long as for the flu;5. About 8% of people get the flu every year. Some estimates are 25% to 50% possibly up to 80% could get the coronavirus without drastic actions being taken by individuals states and municipalities and the federal government;6. The coronavirus could be 10 times deadlier than the flu — about 0.1% who get flu die. It's estimated that about 1% of those who have gotten coronavirus have died from it;7. There are treatments for the flu. There are no approved treatments for the coronavirus despite the president's optimism for certain drugs which are untested for coronavirus to this point; and8. The flu tends to wane in warm weather but it's too soon to count on that for coronavirus which is thriving in warm tropical places.One of the people advising the president has already argued that this is not a good comparison to make.""I mean people always say 'Well the flu does this the flu does that' "" Dr. Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said two weeks ago during a hearing before the House Oversight and Reform Committee. He added ""The flu has a mortality rate of 0.1%. This has a mortality rate of 10 times that. That's the reason I want to emphasize we have to stay ahead of the game in preventing this.""In that same hearing by the way Fauci also noted that H1N1 flu which was a pandemic in 2009 was far less lethal than even the seasonal flu. Trump has criticized the Obama administration for its response to H1N1 when he os criticized for his response to the coronavirus."
41,U.S. Senate passes $2 trillion bill for 'strange and evil' coronavirus crisis,Richard Cowan David Morgan Patricia Zengerle,Reuters,0,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-congress/u-s-senate-passes-2-trillion-bill-for-strange-and-evil-coronavirus-crisis-idUSKBN21C1C0,WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Wednesday unanimously backed a $2 trillion bill aimed at helping unemployed workers and industries hurt by the coronavirus epidemic as well as providing billions of dollars to buy urgently needed medical equipment.After bitter negotiations the deeply divided Senate came together and passed the bill by a 96-0 vote which sent the massive stimulus package to the House of Representatives for a vote on Friday.President Donald Trump whose top aides helped negotiate the bipartisan measure promised to sign it into law as soon as it reaches his desk. “I will sign it immediately” Trump told reporters on Wednesday.The rescue package - which would be the biggest ever passed by Congress - includes a $500 billion fund to help hard-hit industries and a comparable amount for direct payments of up to $3000 apiece to millions of U.S. families.The legislation will also provide $350 billion for small-business loans $250 billion for expanded unemployment aid and at least $100 billion for hospitals and related health systems.Senate leaders noted the historic nature of the challenge posed by the coronavirus which the Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called “a strange and evil disease.”The package is intended to flood the economy with cash in a bid to stem the impact of an intensifying epidemic that has killed more than 900 people in the United States and infected at least 60000.Only two other nations China and Italy have more coronavirus cases and the World Health Organization has warned the United States looks set to become the epicenter of the global coronavirus pandemic.Top aides to Trump and senior senators from both parties announced that they had agreed on the unprecedented stimulus bill in the early hours of Wednesday after five days of talks.But it was delayed by criticism from both the right and left on Wednesday pushing the final vote on passage almost another full day.The U.S. Capitol Building as seen ahead of a vote on the coronavirus (COVID-19) relief bill on Capitol Hill in Washington U.S. March 25 2020. REUTERS/Tom BrennerSeveral Republican senators had insisted the bill needed to be changed to ensure that laid-off workers would not be paid more in unemployment benefits than they earned on the job. However an amendment that would have changed the unemployment provision failed just before the Senate approved the measure.There had been criticism of the bill from the most progressive wing of the Democratic-led House. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez called it “a historic corporate giveaway” on Twitter.HOUSE VOICE VOTE ON FRIDAYHowever House leaders hoped the bill would pass by voice vote on Friday without representatives having to return to Washington. Bringing more than 400 lawmakers from as far away as Hawaii and Alaska would be difficult because a few are in self-quarantine and several states have issued stay-at-home orders.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she hoped the bill would pass quickly and that Congress would pass further legislation if necessary to ease the crisis going forward.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had criticized the bill saying the $3.8 billion allocated to his state would not cover tax revenue it will lose from reduced economic activity. New York accounts for roughly half of all U.S. coronavirus cases.Pelosi expressed sympathy but wanted the rescue package to move on. “We (Congress) do have to do more but that would be no reason to stop this step that we are taking” she told CNN.The stimulus package follows two others that became law earlier this month. The money at stake amounts to nearly half of the $4.7 trillion the U.S. government spends annually.Slideshow (16 Images)Investors were cheered by the news of the deal. On Wall Street the benchmark S&P 500 .SPX rallied for a second straight day closing up 1.15%.“Our nation obviously is going through a kind of crisis that is totally unprecedented in living memory” Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said shortly before the vote on passage.McConnell also announced that after passing the bill the Senate would leave Washington and be in recess at least until April 20. He said he would give senators 24 hours notice if they needed to come back to Washington for another vote before then.Missing from Wednesday’s votes was No. 2 Senate Republican John Thune who said in a statement he did not feel well when he woke up on Wednesday and decided to take a charter flight home to South Dakota “out of an abundance of caution.”Thune did not say whether he had coronavirus symptoms although he said he was not advised to self-quarantine.Another Republican senator Rand Paul announced on Sunday he had tested positive for the illness and a handful of others have self-quarantined after being exposed to Paul or others who have had it.
42,Biden calls Trump's Easter back-to-business goal 'catastrophic',Trevor Hunnicutt,Reuters,0,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-biden/biden-calls-trumps-easter-back-to-business-goal-catastrophic-idUSKBN21C3B2,(Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said on Wednesday that potential efforts by President Donald Trump to re-open American businesses in time for the Easter holiday could be “catastrophic.”The governors of at least 18 states including New York and California have issued stay-at-home directives affecting about half the U.S. population and shuttering many businesses in a costly effort to slow the deadly pathogen’s spread.Trump on Tuesday told reporters he would like to see businesses opening their doors again by Easter which will be celebrated on April 12. “I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter” he said on Fox News Channel.Biden the front-runner for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in the November election said a quick return to normalcy could backfire.“Now he’s suggesting he wants to get the country back opened by Easter” Biden told reporters on a video conference warning that it was an arbitrary or symbolic timeline.“It would be a catastrophic thing to do for our people and for our economy if we sent people back to work just as we were beginning to see the impact of social distancing take hold only to unleash a second spike in infections” Biden said. “That’d be far more devastating in the long run.”Biden has been critical of Trump’s response to the coronavirus saying that a delayed effort to scramble tests and medical equipment meant Americans would be hit harder and take longer to recover. On Tuesday he said on MSNBC that it “would be a real resurrection” to see American businesses re-open by Easter.Biden also called on businesses and investors to be guided by “the science of medicine” and “not the science of Wall Street” as they weigh what path is best for the economy.Trump and his coronavirus team on March 16 put in place recommendations for people across the country to cut down social and professional interactions for 15 days in a bid to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Public health experts have said the timing for ending such orders must be flexible and based on medical research.

Mark Meadows (R-NC) walk to a meeting during negotiations on a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) relief package on Capitol in Washington U.S. March 24 2020. REUTERS/Al DragoA report commissioned by House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi threw cold water on the idea of voting remotely saying it did not have confidence in the security of systems that could allow its members to vote from outside of the Capitol building.Remote voting “would raise serious security logistical and constitutional challenges” said a report released late Monday by the majority Democratic staff on the chamber’s rules committee.Congress is currently struggling to agree to a nearly $2 trillion economic rescue bill in response to the coronavirus’ impact. Two members of the House and one senator have tested positive for the virus and several other lawmakers are in self-isolation.Pelosi a Democrat and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell a Republican have publicly dismissed the idea of remote voting. But a growing number of lawmakers have urged them to think again noting the dangers of jumping on planes to congregate in large numbers in defiance of health guidelines.Democratic Representatives Eric Swalwell and Katie Porter urged the change in a Monday letter signed by dozens of other lawmakers. In the Senate the number two Democrat Dick Durbin and Republican Rob Portman have introduced legislation for voting remotely in a crisis.“We’re hoping to work with the parliamentarian and officers of the Senate to come up with something that is bipartisan makes sense and protects the integrity of voting on the floor of the United States Senate” Durbin said Tuesday.The coronavirus has already diminished the ranks of the Senate’s Republican majority reducing their leverage as they negotiate the coronavirus package. With five Republican senators either sick or in quarantine their majority of 53-47 has shrunk to 48-47.The House is currently not in session and its members are spread across the United States but it will be required to vote on the coronavirus package if and when it passes the Senate. The House report said the likely best way to do this would be by voice vote or “unanimous consent” a procedure usually reserved for non-controversial proposals.That step was used during the 1918 flu pandemic.Then there is the question of how Congress will operate going forward. A prolonged recess could leave much of the field to Republican President Donald Trump as the coronavirus crisis continues to play out in the coming weeks and possibly months.The House report said one option might be proxy voting in which an absent member gives a present member their proxy to cast a vote for them. But it said there could also be constitutional challenges to this.

46,U.S. lawmakers nearing deal for massive aviation sector bailout: sources,David Shepardson Tracy Rucinski,Reuters,0,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-airlines/u-s-lawmakers-nearing-deal-for-massive-aviation-sector-bailout-sources-idUSKBN21B2LS,WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers are nearing agreement on a $61 billion rescue package for the aviation sector that would include $25 billion in payroll grants for passenger airlines weathering a sharp falloff in travel demand amid rising coronavirus outbreaks three people briefed on the matter said.FILE PHOTO: American Airlines passenger planes crowd a runway where they are parked due to flight reductions made to slow the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) at Tulsa International Airport in Tulsa Oklahoma U.S. March 23 2020. REUTERS/Nick Oxford/File PhotoThe deal which still needs final approval from lawmakers is also expected to include $4 billion in grants for cargo carriers and $3 billion for contractors like caterers to cover payroll costs as well as another $29 billion in loans.The package follows a forceful push by airlines and unions that any aid include grants rather than just loans as in a preliminary Republican proposal envisioned over the weekend.Airlines have warned that without cash grants they could be forced to lay off hundreds of thousands of people as U.S. travel demand has collapsed leaving the airlines without trained staff to jump-start their operations and the economy once demand returns.The aviation package would be part of a $2 trillion U.S. coronavirus economic stimulus package that lawmakers have been debating.Airline finances have become increasingly stretched as planes fly nearly empty and more people cancel flights than book new ones. S&P downgraded Delta Air Lines’ (DAL.N) credit rating to junk on Tuesday.“The action by S&P underscores the need for swift relief for airline employees that is currently being considered by the government” a Delta spokesman said.Airlines’ argument that grants rather than loans were essential to keep workers on the payroll won the strong backing of House Democrats who proposed $40 billion in cash grants on Monday.In a last-ditch effort airlines offered to keep all workers on board until at least Aug. 31 if they received the grants. That date may be extended by a month in the final bill said one of the three people familiar with the matter.Airlines previously agreed to forgo stock buybacks and dividends and limit executive compensation if they won cash grants. It is unclear if U.S. Treasury will be able to demand equity as a condition of the assistance.U.S. airline stocks were up sharply on Tuesday afternoon on optimism a deal was near. American Airlines Group Inc (AAL.O) shares were up 30% at $13.32 Delta Air Lines (DAL.N) jumped 15.8% United Airlines (UAL.O) rose 20.4% and JetBlue Airways Corp (JBLU.O) was up 27.7%.Other airlines around the world contemplating months without flying have also said they need the support of their governments to survive.

That was less than 24 hours after he and more than 400 other members of the House of Representatives crowded into the chamber to pass a sweeping coronavirus aid package.Representative Ben McAdamsThe Utah Democrat said on March 18 that he had the virus also having developed symptoms on March 14. In a statement on Tuesday the 45-year-old said he was hospitalized and doctors were monitoring his occasional need for oxygen.WHO IS SELF-QUARANTINED?Republican Senators Mitt Romney and Mike Lee said on Sunday they would self-quarantine after having spent time with Paul.Romney said on Tuesday that he had tested negative for the virus but would stay in quarantine. His wife Ann has multiple sclerosis.At least four other senators previously self-quarantined. They are Republicans Cory Gardner Lindsey Graham Rick Scott and Ted Cruz. All have since returned to public life.On Wednesday Republican Senator John Thune returned to his home in South Dakota on a chartered airplane after waking up feeling ill. Thune’s office said doctors encouraged him to continue “self-monitoring” but that self-quarantine was not necessary.Democratic Senator and former presidential contender Amy Klobuchar said on Monday her husband 52-year-old John Bessler had the virus and was in the hospital but she was not at risk because she had not seen him for two weeks.

49,Forget politics. Majority of Republicans Democrats now agree coronavirus is 'serious threat': Reuters/Ipsos poll,Chris Kahn,Reuters,0,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-poll/forget-politics-majority-of-republicans-democrats-now-agree-coronavirus-is-serious-threat-reuters-ipsos-poll-idUSKBN21C02T,NEW YORK (Reuters) - Seven in 10 Americans now consider the coronavirus pandemic to be “a serious threat to me and my family” according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll that shows how wide bipartisan segments of the country feel their lives have been turned upside down by the health crisis.The March 18-24 poll released on Tuesday found that 68% of U.S. adults agreed that the virus was a serious existential threat up 14 percentage points from a similar poll that ran last week. This includes majorities of Democrats and Republicans whites minorities young old urban suburban and rural residents.The findings reveal how the United States which for years has been sharply divided politically over almost every major issue has come together on at least one topic. Just last week 63% of Democrats and 49% of Republicans said they considered the coronavirus to be a personal threat; now 76% of Democrats and 63% of Republicans feel the same way.Americans continue to be divided over their trust in President Donald Trump and the federal government’s efforts to control the spread of coronavirus however.Fifty-three percent of Americans say they think the federal government is doing a good job responding to the outbreak which is up 3 points from last week. Another 41% said they do not think the government is doing a good job.Trump’s overall approval numbers did rise slightly to 44% over the past few weeks but at 4% it was a modest rise for a president confronting a national crisis. Former President George W. Bush’s approval rating shot up by 39 points to 90% in the days following the Sept. 11 2001 attacks according to Gallup polling service.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted after many Americans have seen their lives transformed almost overnight as health officials struggle to contain the virus. Nearly 50000 people are known to have been infected with COVID-19 in the United States and more than 600 people have died.There are now cases in all 50 states and the rapid spread of the illness combined with the lack of testing kits and other protective equipment has led many states and communities to shutter non-essential businesses require residents to stay at home and ban large gatherings.The online poll of 4428 U.S. adults showed just how much people’s lives have changed over the last few weeks.The poll found that 33% now think it is “very” or “somewhat” likely that they will be infected with the virus within the next year up 5 points from last week.More than half of the country - 53% - say the coronavirus has directly impacted their place of business up 7 points from last week. And 40% believe that the virus will have a “long-term negative impact” on the economy.Among those parents who have children at home 52% are now keeping their kids out of school because of the coronavirus up from 37% last week.Sixty-seven percent of Americans say they are now washing their hands more frequently which is up 7 points from last week and 61% are practicing “social distancing” by avoiding physical contact with others up 10 points from a week ago.One out of three Americans say they are now avoiding public transportation and one in three say they have canceled or changed their travel plans to avoid the virus. About 24% said they are now working from home up 8 points from last week.Still a sizable minority of Americans appear to disbelieve warnings from public health officials about the seriousness of the outbreak.Roughly one in five Americans strongly agreed that people are panicking unnecessarily that the virus is mostly a problem for people who live in urban areas and that the crisis has been exaggerated by the media.About one in 10 said they have not altered their daily routine in any way in response to the coronavirus.When it comes to the economy American opinion is sharply divided along party lines with 66% of Republicans saying that it is still going in the right direction and 68% saying they think the coronavirus will have only a short-term impact.Among Democrats 74% think the economy is on the wrong track and 57% believe the virus will have a long-term economic impact.A children's playground is closed with caution tape amid the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in Seattle Washington U.S. March 24 2020.

No one has said ‘no.’”
51,More questions and answers about the coronavirus checks,NAOMI JAGODA,The Hill,0,https://thehill.com/policy/finance/489762-more-questions-and-answers-about-the-coronavirus-checks,Americans are keenly interested in the cash payments included in the coronavirus relief bill that is soon expected to become law.Under the bill millions of households will receive rebates in the amount of $1200 per adult and $500 per child. The amounts phase out for individuals making more than $75000 and married couples making over $150000.The Senate passed the bill late Wednesday and the House is expected to pass it on Friday. Trump is expected to sign the legislation.The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in an analysis released Thursday that the rebates will reduce federal revenue by $292 billion over a decade with all of the revenue loss occurring in fiscal years 2020 and 2021.Many people are facing financial challenges as a result of the coronavirus and have questions about whether and how they will receive a check. The Hill answered several frequently asked questions about the checks on Wednesday. Here are answers to additional questions.Will people have to pay taxes on the money when they file their tax returns next year?No. The money is not counted as taxable income. It’s treated as a fully refundable tax credit against your 2020 taxes meaning that you get the money even if you don’t have any tax liability.Can people get checks even if they haven’t filed a tax return in recent years?In cases where people haven’t filed tax returns but receive Social Security benefits or railroad retirement benefits the IRS can look at statements about those benefits to help get the checks to those people.For people who have not filed a 2018 or 2019 tax return and do not receive Social Security or railroad retirement benefits there is an incentive to promptly file a tax return to ensure that the IRS can reach them to distribute the money to them this year. People who do not file tax returns are typically low-income. For example the IRS requires married couples with both spouses under 65 to file returns for 2019 if their gross income was at least $24400. That threshold is raised to $27000 in cases where both spouses were 65 or older. Social Security benefits often aren’t included in gross income.Are immigrants eligible to receive the checks?They are if they have a Social Security number. A Republican aide to the Senate Finance Committee noted in a call with reporters Wednesday that Green Card holders qualify for work-eligible Social Security numbers.Are college students eligible to receive the checks?If college students are at least 17 years old and are claimed as a dependent on their parents’ return their family would not receive any payment amount for them. A college student who filed their own return and was not claimed as a dependent on their parents’ return would qualify for the rebates.I made $85000 last year. How much money will I receive?For a single tax filer the rebate amount reduces by $5 for every $100 of income over $75000. So a single person with no children who had adjusted gross income of $85000 in 2019 and has already filed their 2019 tax return would receive $700.Keep in mind that phase-out of the credit is based on people’s adjusted gross income which does not include income put into pre-tax accounts such as traditional 401(k)s. As a result someone with an annual salary of $85000 and no other income would have adjusted gross income of less than $85000.How can people who recently moved ensure they get their checks?If you received a refund in 2018 or 2019 via direct deposit to your bank account and you did not change your bank account when you moved you should be able to receive your rebate via direct deposit.Tax experts said that they think it would be helpful for the IRS to provide guidance for taxpayers who have moved or have new bank accounts since they filed their most recent tax return.Under the bill the IRS has to send a notice to a taxpayer’s last known address within 15 days of distributing a payment. The notice should provide information about the payment amount the method used to make the payment and an IRS phone number to report failures to receive the payment.How are check amounts impacted if someone has a child in 2020?Tax experts said that since advanced payment amounts are based on taxpayers’ 2018 or 2019 returns people who have children in 2020 would receive payments this year that don't take into account the new children. However the rebates are credits against 2020 taxes so new parents will get the additional credit reflecting their children when they file their 2020 tax returns next year.What are areas where IRS guidance might be helpful?The coronavirus relief bill is not yet law and the IRS has yet to provide information about how it plans to implement the provision about the rebates. On the IRS’s coronavirus landing page the agency is telling people not to call it right now and to check back for updates at a later point.Tax experts are hoping that the IRS issues guidance to clarify issues about eligibility when taxpayers’ situations differ in 2018 2019 and 2020 as well as guidance about which non-filers now need to submit a tax return in order to receive a payment.
52,Overnight Defense: Pentagon grapples with coronavirus outbreak | Aircraft carrier docks in Guam after more sailors test positive | Army hospitals to reach NY on Friday,ELLEN MITCHELL ,The Hill,0,https://thehill.com/policy/defense/overnights/489761-overnight-defense-pentagon-grapples-with-coronavirus-outbreak,"Happy Thursday and welcome to Overnight Defense. I'm Ellen Mitchell and here's your nightly guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon on Capitol Hill and beyond. CLICK HERE to subscribe to the newsletter. THE TOPLINE: A U.S. Navy aircraft carrier where nearly two dozen sailors have reportedly tested positive for the coronavirus will pull into port in Guam while everyone on board is tested for the virus the Navy's top civilian said Thursday.""We found several more cases on board the ship"" acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said at a Pentagon briefing. ""We are in the process of testing 100 percent of the crew of that ship to ensure that we're able to contain the spread of whatever might have occurred there on the ship.""But I also want to emphasize that the ship is operationally capable and can do its mission if required to do so"" he continued. ""So the ship is pulling into Guam. It will be pierside. No one on the crew will be allowed to leave anywhere into Guam other than on pierside.""New cases: Modly said at the briefing that eight sailors aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier had tested positive and were flown off the ship as was reported Wednesday evening.But The Wall Street Journal reported shortly after the briefing wrapped that at least 23 sailors aboard the ship have now tested positive for the virus.In a statement Thursday afternoon Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday said ""additional positive cases"" had been discovered without specifying the number adding that ""we expect additional positive tests.""""We are taking this threat very seriously and are working quickly to identify and isolate positive cases while preventing further spread of the virus aboard the ship"" Gilday said. ""We are confident that our aggressive response will keep USS Theodore Roosevelt able to respond to any crisis in the region.""Ship details: The ship holds a crew of 5000 sailors as well as dozens of fighter jets and other types of aircraft.The carrier had been operating in the Philippine Sea and the decision to dock it in Guam effectively sidelines what officials consider a major source of America's power projection.The carrier was last in port 15 days ago in Danang Vietnam. Officials have previously said the coronavirus cases may not necessarily be tied to the port visit since aircraft regularly land on the ship bringing in new people from outside the command.What we know about the sailors: Modly said all the sailors who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 are experiencing mild symptoms.""The sailors who have been flown off the ship are currently doing fine. None of them have been required to be hospitalized because their symptoms are very mild"" he said. ""They're aches and pain and those types of things sore throats but nothing that required hospitalization. So they are in quarantine now on Guam.""He also said there is limited capacity to conduct coronavirus tests in labs on board the carrier without flying the tests to outside labs. There are about 800 testing kits aboard the ship with more being flown there today he added.In all Modly said 104 active-duty sailors 23 civilians 16 dependents and 19 contractors have tested positive in the Navy. ARMY HOSPITALS TO REACH NYC FRIDAY: Two Army field hospitals sent to New York will be reach the city on Friday and be set up to treat non-coronavirus patients at the Javits Center starting Monday according to the Army's top general.The service's 531st Hospital from Fort Campbell Ky. and the 9th Hospital from Fort Hood Texas are expected to set up at the Manhattan location over the weekend bringing with them the equipment and personnel to staff 284 beds Army Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville told reporters at the Pentagon on Thursday.FEMA will provide beds and some equipment while the deployed hospitals are bringing roughly 650 personnel and their own equipment as well. The Army does not need to use tents as the medical facility will be set up within an already existing structure McConville said. Meanwhile in Seattle: The Army has also deployed to Seattle another 600 personnel with the 627th Hospital from Fort Carson Colo. which arrived on Wednesday evening.Army personnel ""are coordinating with state and local authorities and conducting a site survey of the CenturyLink Field and a state fairground"" to decide where to place the 248 beds they will support McConville said. Retired personnel wanted: To gain more help with the missions in New York and Washington state the Army has reached out to retired personnel with medical expertise to see if they would return to the service as volunteers McConville said.  But efforts 'insufficient': The Pentagon has scrambled in recent weeks to support state and federal efforts to quell the spread of COVID-19 while also keeping its forces and civilian personnel safe.Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Wednesday ordered a stop to all troop movement overseas for 60 days and raised the military's health protection level to its second-highest setting for all military installations globally.But a recently released order from Army headquarters has stated that ""mitigation measures taken by the Army to blunt the spread of COVID-19 have proven insufficient.""""COVID-19 continues to spread geographically as the number of infected persons continues to rise"" according to the order.""Additional measures and actions are required to protect the force from further spread of COVID-19.""The Army has 288 confirmed cases of the coronavirus -- roughly half of total cases in the military -- including 100 soldiers 64 civilians 65 dependents nine cadets and 50 contractors. PENTAGON GRAPPLES WITH CRISIS: The U.S. military is grappling with the coronavirus pandemic as service members seek to provide aid and protect themselves from infection.The Department of Defense is engaging in a balancing act deploying field hospitals to different cities facing severe outbreaks while scaling back operations elsewhere. Military leaders said Thursday that 280 service members tested positive for COVID-19 and thousands of others in the U.S. and abroad are being monitored for potential exposure.While the number of service members with the virus is relatively low the military has still imposed tight restrictions as a precaution scaling back on training new recruits closing in-person recruiting centers postponing major military exercises with allies and limiting travel.Military leaders and experts both say the Pentagon could take other measures if the virus spreads further among service members raising questions about whether readiness could be affected.""If this pandemic continues at the scale and scope of what some are predicting over time you could start seeing an impact on readiness ... But nothing to which I fear impacts our mission readiness to conduct our national missions"" Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Monday.Predictions: Top military officials have predicted the outbreak could last months as the number of impacted service members rises.""I think we need to plan for this to be a few months long at least and we're taking all precautionary measures to do that"" Esper said Tuesday during a virtual town hall meeting.The Pentagon on Wednesday also reported its first positive case of a personnel member who works inside the building becoming infected with COVID-19 according to Defense One.A contractor for the Defense Security Cooperation Agency on Saturday became the first military personnel to die as a result of the virus the Pentagon announced Sunday."
53,US now leads the world in known coronavirus cases,PETER SULLIVAN ,The Hill,0,https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/489760-us-now-leads-the-world-in-known-coronavirus-cases,"The United States now has the most known coronavirus cases of any country in the world passing Italy and China.The U.S. had 82404 cases as of Thursday evening according to data from Johns Hopkins University vaulting to the top spot amid ramped up testing.The milestone is a foreboding distinction for the United States setting off alarms that the epidemic continues to get worse in the country.Experts have raised warnings that the U.S. trajectory is continuing to climb. The U.S. had more than 14000 new cases on Wednesday according to a New York Times tracker and the number of new cases announced each day continues to climb.Jeremy Konyndyk a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development wrote on Twitter that the U.S. case trajectories are ""alarming.""He added that the distribution of cases around the U.S. is also concerning in contrast to China which imposed a stringent crackdown to keep cases largely confined to Hubei province where the outbreak began.“China had a bonfire in Hubei but was stamping out sparks everywhere else” he wrote. “We've now got a bonfire in NYC and campfires almost everywhere else - and all still shooting out sparks.”A study from the University of Washington on Thursday warned that between 38000 and 162000 people could die in the United States in the next four months from the virus and that hospital capacity could be overwhelmed as soon as the second week of April.The worsening situation comes as President Trump has expressed eagerness in recent days to ease up on measures that have closed businesses and urged people to stay at home. Experts are urging the president not to ease up on those restrictions yet warning the crisis could get even worse.Trump asked about the milestone for the U.S. on Thursday said it reflected increased testing and questioned China’s numbers.“I think it's a tribute to the testing” he told reporters. “We're testing tremendous numbers of people.”“I'm sure you're not able to tell what China is testing or not testing I think that's a little hard” Trump added.The spike in cases in the United States also comes as testing improves so the country is better able to identify cases that previously went undetected.The Trump administration has taken intense criticism for the extremely slow rollout of tests in the initial weeks of the outbreak. The situation has been improving recently as more private labs have come on line to do mass testing though problems remain.“The rise of COVID cases in US is unrelenting” tweeted Ashish Jha director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. “A sign that we had many more un-identified cases while we couldn't test...and a lot of community transmission still. Long way to go turn this around.”"

The ship is expected to dock in New York on Monday roughly a week ahead of schedule after it had to undergo repairs.""I’ll kiss it goodbye"" Trump said during a coronavirus briefing on Thursday. ""It’s in Virginia as you know and I will go and we’ll be waving together because I suspect the media will be following.""The trip to Norfolk will be Trump's first time leaving Washington D.C. in a little over two weeks. He has remained largely hunkered down in the White House as the virus has spread across the country.Multiple White House officials and lawmakers Trump has been around have self-quarantined after coming into contact with individuals with the virus.The USNS Comfort will be loaded up with critical supplies and medical professionals as it sails to its destination in New York. The ship will be used to treat patients who are not infected with coronavirus to create additional hospital space for those patients in the city.Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-N.Y.) and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio have warned that the city's hospitals will soon be at capacity with coronavirus patients and a New York Times story published Wednesday illustrated how some facilities are already struggling with overcrowding because of the pandemic. There are more than 82000 cases of coronavirus in the U.S. as of early Thursday evening and more than 1100 Americans have died of the disease. Nearly 300 of those deaths have come from New York City.Another Naval hospital ship the USNS Mercy has been dispatched to Los Angeles."
55,EPA suspends enforcement of environmental laws amid coronavirus,REBECCA BEITSCH,The Hill,0,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/489753-epa-suspends-enforcement-of-environmental-laws-amid-coronavirus,The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a sweeping suspension of its enforcement of environmental laws Thursday telling companies they would not need to meet environmental standards during the coronavirus outbreak.  The temporary policy for which EPA has set no end date would allow any number of industries to skirt environmental laws with the agency saying it will not “seek penalties for noncompliance with routine monitoring and reporting obligations.”Cynthia Giles who headed EPA’s Office of Enforcement during the Obama administration called it a moratorium on enforcing the nation's environmental laws and an abdication of EPA’s duty. “This EPA statement is essentially a nationwide waiver of environmental rules for the indefinite future. It tells companies across the country that they will not face enforcement even if they emit unlawful air and water pollution in violation of environmental laws so long as they claim that those failures are in some way 'caused' by the virus pandemic. And it allows them an out on monitoring too so we may never know how bad the violating pollution was” she wrote in a statement to The Hill.The EPA has been under pressure from a number of industries including the oil industry to suspend enforcement of a number of environmental regulations due to the pandemic.“EPA is committed to protecting human health and the environment but recognizes challenges resulting from efforts to protect workers and the public from COVID-19 may directly impact the ability of regulated facilities to meet all federal regulatory requirements” EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler said in a statement. In a 10-page letter to EPA earlier this week the American Petroleum Institute (API) asked for a suspension of rules that require repairing leaky equipment as well as monitoring to make sure pollution doesn’t seep into nearby water.Other industries had also asked to ignite the “force majeure” clauses of any legal settlements they had signed with EPA allowing for an extension on deadlines to meet various environmental goals in the face of unforeseen circumstances.But Giles and others say the memo signed Thursday goes beyond that request giving industries board authority to pollute with little overnight from the agency. “Incredibly the EPA statement does not even reserve EPA's right to act in the event of an imminent threat to public health” Giles said. “Instead EPA says it will defer to states and ‘work with the facility’ to minimize or prevent the threat. EPA should never relinquish its right and its obligation to act immediately and decisively when there is threat to public health no matter what the reason is. I am not aware of any instance when EPA ever relinquished this fundamental authority as it does in this memo.”The memo says companies should try to minimize “the effects and duration of any noncompliance” with environmental laws and should also keep records of their own noncompliance along with identifying how the coronavirus was a factor.Critics say it's not unreasonable to refrain from environmental enforcement on a case-by-case basis when companies are unable to comply with the letter of the law but many were alarmed by the breadth of Thursdays memo.“It is not clear why refineries chemical plants and other facilities that continue to operate and keep their employees on the production line will no longer have the staff or time they need to comply with environmental laws” Eric Schaeffer a former director of civil enforcement at EPA who is now with the Environmental Integrity Project wrote in a letter signed by a number of environmental groups in anticipation of the memo.The letter writers also criticized the requests from API arguing nearby communities would face prolonged exposure to a number of air and water pollutants that might be expelled through oil production – something they say would have “a very specific impact on public health and safety.”The diminished compliance requirements for industry comes as EPA has refused to budge on deadlines for comments as they proceed with a number of deregulatory actions.Environmental and public health groups had argued that those with science and health backgrounds who would normally weigh in on such regulations have been pulled into the coronavirus fight leaving them unable to divert their attention.“The Environmental Protection Agency has not shown the same concern for the impact the coronavirus has had on the ability of community and public interest groups to respond to various proposals to weaken environmental standards” Schaeffer wrote in the letter.But EPA has argued exceptions were not needed.“We’re open and continuing our regulatory work business as usual” an EPA spokesperson told The Hill in a statement. “As regulations.gov is fully functioning there is no barrier to the public providing comment during the established periods.”
56,EPA watchdog to review pollution plans after threat to withhold California highway funding,REBECCA BEITSCH,The Hill,0,https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/489746-eps-watchdog-to-review-pollution-plans-at-center-of-agency-threat,"The Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) internal watchdog will review the agency’s methods for regulating states’ air pollution following threats by Administrator Andrew Wheeler to withhold highway funding from California if they did not update their plans.The evaluation from EPA’s Office of Inspector General spurred by a request from lawmakers  will focus on State Implementation Plans (SIP) used by the agency to ensure states are meeting air quality standards.But plans that would otherwise draw little attention beyond EPA circles were brought to the spotlight through the ongoing battle between the Trump administration and California.In September Wheeler wrote state leaders saying they owed the agency an urgent turnaround on a backlog of air pollution plans.“Since the 1970s California has failed to carry out its most basic tasks under the Clean Air Act. California has the worst air quality in the United States” Wheeler wrote adding that the state has 130 outdated plans across various regions some of which date back decades.He later floated withholding billions in federal highway funds.“We certainly want to avoid these triggers but our foremost concern must be ensuring clean air for all Americans” Wheeler wrote.Wheeler’s letter came just days after President Trump announced he would revoke the waiver that allows California to set tougher emissions standards for vehicles--something California has argued is necessary to fight its air pollution.Two days after threatening to withhold funding based on the SIPs Wheeler sent another letter saying the state is ""failing to meet its obligations” on sewage and water pollution.The review from OIG asks a number of questions about SIPs including why states may face delays in getting EPA approval.An EPA spokesperson said the agency is aware of the audit and will comply with requests."

MLB and Fanatics will cover all costs associated with the endeavor they said.“We hope this effort can play a part in coming together as a community to help us through this challenging situation” MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement.Fanatics will produce up to 1 million masks and gowns and distribute them throughout Pennsylvania New Jersey and New York the latter of which has been the epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S.The company is making its first batch of masks and gowns using materials typically used to make jerseys for the Philadelphia Phillies and New York Yankees. Other team jersey materials will be featured as production expands.Thursday was originally scheduled to be MLB's Opening Day but the start of the season has been delayed due to the virus.There are more than 80000 cases of coronavirus in the U.S. as of early Thursday evening and more than 1100 Americans have died of the disease.

Chief of Space Operations Gen. John Raymond tweeted Thursday thanking those involved in the project.The launch deemed mission essential went ahead Thursday despite the coronavirus outbreak that has infected at least 280 U.S. troops and disrupted training exercises overseas deployments and other military activities.The Lockheed Martin-built AEHF satellites are replacing the older Milstar constellation of military communication satellites. The sixth AEHF is the last one in the $15 billion program with the Air Force having launched the other five before the Space Force’s creation.The Space Force was created in December with the signing of the annual defense policy bill.Its establishment fulfilled a top priority for President Trump since he first floated the idea in 2018 and turned it into a reliable applause line at his campaign rallies.Though Trump coined the name Space Force the idea for a separate branch of the military for space originated as a bipartisan House idea in 2017.The new service is aimed at protecting U.S. assets in space such as satellites from earthly threats including U.S. adversaries Russia and China."
59,Travel industry hails REAL ID extension says may need to be longer,ALEX GANGITANO ,The Hill,0,https://thehill.com/news-by-subject/transportation-infrastructure/489739-travel-industry-hails-real-id-extension-says,The U.S. Travel Association applauded the administration for delaying the enforcement date of REAL ID requirements which the group said would have likely caused greater economic uncertainty but cautioned the extension may need to be longer.Americans will now have until Oct. 1 2021 to get Real ID Act compliant identification the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced on Thursday which will be needed to board commercial flights enter federal buildings or gain access to American nuclear plants.“We applaud the administration for recognizing the challenges enforcing REAL ID requirements on travelers would present to what we hope will be a full and speedy economic recovery. We believe implementing REAL ID enforcement prior to full recovery would severely delay or reverse the travel industry’s ability to recover quickly from the coronavirus crisis” U.S. Travel CEO Roger Dow wrote in a letter to DHS acting Secretary Chad Wolf. If REAL ID were implemented today an estimated 67400 travelers would be turned away at airport security checkpoints on the first day and more than 471800 within the first week according to a new analysis compiled in part by U.S. Travel. But Dow also called for a further extension for more time for Americans to recover from the coronavirus pandemic.“Over the next 18 months people will be focused on building their lives back not going to the DMV. The economic damage of coronavirus is already massive and as we move toward a recovery phase it would be awful if the REAL ID deadline hits and creates yet another obstacle to people traveling” U.S. Travel CEO Roger Dow said in a statement on Thursday. The REAL ID compliance rate was only at 35 percent as of February according to the letter.The letter also noted that the struggling travel industry will cost the economy $910 billion from a $355 billion decline in direct travel spending due to the coronavirus pandemic. It also estimates that 5.9 million travel industry jobs will be lost before May.President Trump recommended delaying the enforcement date earlier this week to ease crowding at Department of Motor Vehicle offices telling reporters he would postpone it until October 2020.

A trade feud between Saudi Arabia and Russia has led oil to drop to its lowest level in nearly 20 years.But efforts to boost the industry by filling the U.S. petroleum reserve failed to get funding in the latest stimulus bills.The low prices are likely to have reverberations elsewhere in the market.Electric vehicle (EV) sales were down last year a trend IHS expects to continue in the short term.“We expect EV sales to stagnate in 2020 and likely into 2021” the group wrote. “Global climate ambitions however are unlikely to be downgraded and will continue to support the path ahead for EVs over the longer term.”"

62,Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro other top officials charged in US drug trafficking inquiry,Kevin Johnson,USA Today,0,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/26/venezuela-president-nicolas-maduro-charged-drug-trafficking-inquiry/2914758001/,"Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro was charged with federal drug trafficking crimes as part of a far-reaching U.S. investigation involving prosecutors in New York Washington and Miami officials said Thursday.Attorney General William Barr announced the extraordinary action Thursday saying charges were filed against more than a dozen other current and former Venezuelan officials including the country's Supreme Court chief justice and the minister of defense.The years-long investigation federal authorities said revealed a government immersed in ""corruption at the highest levels.""Maduro's government Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said ""betrayed the Venezuelan people … to line their pockets with drug money.""The four-count indictment against Maduro was unsealed in New York and named Diosdado Cabello Rondón head of Venezuela’s National Constituent Assembly; Hugo Armando Carvajal Barrios former director of military intelligence; and Clíver Antonio Alcalá Cordones a former general in the Venezuelan armed forces.“The scope and magnitude of the drug trafficking alleged was made possible only because Maduro and others corrupted the institutions of Venezuela and provided political and military protection for the rampant narco-terrorism crimes described in our charges"" Berman said. Maduro and other officials ""expressly intended to flood the United States with cocaine in order to undermine the health and well being of our nation."" Assistant Attorney General Brian Benczkowski chief of the Justice Department's Criminal Division said the charges show that the Maduro regime was ""propped up by a sham judiciary and a corrupt military"" adding that the country's defense minister authorized regular and enormous shipments of cocaine destined for the U.S.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro ""corrupted the institutions of Venezuela and provided political and military protection for the rampant narco-terrorism crimes"" Manhattan U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman says.In conjunction with the Justice Department action the State Department announced a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction of Maduro and up to $10 million for other Venezuelan officials named in the indictment.“These individuals violated the public trust by facilitating shipments of narcotics from Venezuela including control over planes that leave from a Venezuelan air base as well as control of drug routes through the ports in Venezuela” Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.The payments are offered through the State Department’s Narcotics Rewards Program. For more than two decades according to federal prosecutors Maduro and other top leaders managed a criminal enterprise known as the Cartel de Los Soles (Cartel of the Suns) that conspired with Colombia's leftist guerrilla group known as the FARC to ship tons of cocaine to Central America and the USA.According to court documents the cartel not only sought to enrich its members and bolster its political clout but also to exact maximum harm on the USA by expediting cocaine shipments to American users.Maduro and his alleged conspirators prosecutors asserted ""abused the Venezuelan people and corrupted the legitimate institutions of Venezuela"" from the judiciary and intelligence agencies to the legislature and military.As the cartel's leader Maduro arranged for ""multi-ton"" shipments of FARC-produced cocaine directed the cartel to provide military weapons to the Colombian revolutionary group and used them to train a separate militia that functioned as ""an armed force"" for the cartel.The legal action against Maduro ratchets up tensions with Venezuela where the United States and more than 50 other countries have long called for Maduro's ouster and thrown their support to Juan Guaido as the country's leader.. Guaido has staunch support from the Trump administration and other top U.S. officials.Barr who announced the charges during a virtual news conference necessitated by travel and social distancing restrictions linked to the coronavirus pandemic said the timing of the announcement had been somewhat complicated by the virus.The attorney general however said the onset of the global health crisis was probably ""a good time to rid the country of this corrupt cabal.""""Hopefully the Venezuelan people will see what's going on and gain control of their country"" Barr said.Asked about the likelihood of obtaining Maduro's arrest Barr said ""We do expect to gain control of these defendants."""

The sharp shift in economic output could hit California hardest among all states. “This is really going to be a recession unlike anything we have ever seen before” said Dr. Mark Duggan a Stanford University economist and director at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. “Usually with recessions” he explained “it’s somewhat gradual. This will be just an instantaneous change in the economy.”Already nationwide unemployment claims have exploded past previous records. New data from the U.S. Labor Department shows a historic 3.28 million new initial applications filed last week — a twelvefold increase from the week before. The last record set in 1982 was 695000. Some officials have raised concerns that unemployment could surpass the 2008 Great Recession — or worse the Great Depression. U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin cautioned lawmakers last week that if drastic actions aren’t taken the nation could see 20% unemployment.But Newsom insists the nation's most populous state — with the fifth-largest economy in the world — is well-positioned to weather the storm. Armed with $21 billion in reserves and a strong safety net already in place the governor remains confident that the state is ready for the recession.The road to recovery however could be rocky. California’s underfunded unemployment insurance program has been a problem for decades and only regained solvency in 2018. The state's economic resilience also will come down to revenue. California's budget relies on taxes from stock market investment wins more than most. While the market rallied on Thursday in anticipation of the historic stimulus bill that is expected to pass Congress the coming recession could just as quickly send stocks spiraling again. Now that the markets are taking investors for a ride a sizable chunk of California’s revenue is also on the rollercoaster. Compared to other states California may need more help from the federal government for both response to and recovery from the disaster and is already expected to be among the first to begin borrowing especially to help cover unemployment benefits.Newsom who waived the one-week waiting period in place before the crisis said this week that California's unemployment insurance claims have already passed the 1 million mark.The U.S. Labor Department report shows the state had the largest increases in initial claims with rates rising faster than the country at large and the numbers are more than 13 times higher than they were two weeks ago.Before the crisis the state averaged 2500 claims a week — but for the week ending March 21 more than 186800 new claims were filed. The UCLA Anderson Forecast which revised its quarterly estimates for the first time in its 68-year history last week projected that California's reliance on tourism would make it particularly vulnerable in the coming recession.Economists predict that more than 280000 payroll jobs will be lost as a result more than a third from the leisure hospitality transportation and warehousing sectors. A new report from the Economic Policy Institute a nonprofit nonpartisan think tank paints an even bleaker picture projecting 604741 jobs will be lost in California by this summer.  The state’s underfunded unemployment insurance system will not be able to sustain the need for long at least not on its own.“The unemployment insurance program in California is in the worst state of any in respect to its reserves” Duggan says. For decades analysts have cautioned that California needs to shape up its beleagueredunemployment insurance fund. U.S. Labor Department reports from the past two years deemed California's fund was the least solvent state in the nation. An EDD report issued October 2019 shows the fund ended a nine-year insolvency in 2018 with $2.3 billion left over at the end of the year and was projected to end 2019 with $3 billion. That's a narrow margin for a fund that pays out roughly $5 billion in good years. The report states that ""the current financing system does not allow for sufficient fund reserves to be built up during better economic conditions.""More:Unemployment funds were in trouble before coronavirus. Now claims are sky high.California has long struggled with underfunding unemployment insuranceLast month U.S. Department of Labor listed California as one of six states that would not be able to handle unemployment increases on its own. Duggan said California likely won’t make it to the end of this year on its own coffers.“[California] made some questionable choices for how [they] finance unemployment insurance” he said. “We will be the first state going to the federal government and asking for money for our unemployment insurance.”The system is designed so that taxes collected from employers during a strong economy can sustain the surges in unemployment when things take a turn. But in the late '90s California got stuck in a political standoff between businesses and labor unions and opted to increase its benefit rates without raising the taxes needed to pay for the increase. The state still levies unemployment taxes on only the first $7000 of each employee’s annual wages — the minimum allowed by the federal government.Unemployment claims are soaring in California.“It is extremely insufficient"" economist Ken Jacobs chair of UC Berkeley’s Labor Center said. ""That was clear after the Great Recession"" he explained adding that the state quickly went into the red and had to borrow from the federal government. ""Changes weren’t made then. They need to be made now."" When the economy recovered California continued paying interest on its $10 billion federal loan out of the general fund but the principal was paid back by employers with higher taxes. That created an increasingly difficult environment to make long-term changes to the system.“[Employers] have been willing to do the payback afterward rather than being willing to raise the rates"" Jacobs added.The state Employment Development Department has conceded that it is ill-equipped to handle a recession. In the last report issued at the end of 2019 the EDD wrote that it weathered nine years of insolvency until 2018.In good times the fund pays out roughly $5 billion a year. This year it will need to pay significantly more. To put it into context before the pandemic hit the EDD projected roughly 836000 applications in 2020. In just the first two and a half months of the year Californians had already submitted more than 1 million claims. It’s not just financing that is posing a problem. The rapid change caused by this crisis left little time for the EDD to bolster its staffing. Already the agency is struggling to keep up and quickly process all the claims.While the EDD is rushing to staff up California Labor Secretary Julie Su has directed the department to streamline the process and is bolstering the agency's workforce with staff from other departments and enlisting the help from recent retirees while the office continues to work around the clock.  In the short term Californians can still expect to get their benefits and the state’s system will be shored up by the federal government. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act signed into law on March 18 could funnel roughly $120 million to the state for unemployment insurance. It also adds an extra 13 weeks to federally funded benefits. A separate stimulus bill which passed the U.S. Senate on Wednesday night could also add $600 to state benefits for up to four months which otherwise fall between $40 and $450 a week. Even with the added help California's program is likely to fall into the red. “We will be borrowing from the federal government and the federal government will be borrowing a lot too” Duggan said. “The federal government doesn’t have to run a balanced budget like the states do so the federal government can throw more weaponry than California can. I think the two working together will be really important.”California could lose revenue on capital gainsEven well-funded unemployment systems are not intended as a long-term solution and typically provide only a fraction of pay a person would otherwise have gotten from their normal job. The real resilience test will come down to revenue and the state's ability to get the economy back on track.In a report published last week by the nonpartisan California Legislative Analyst’s Office analyst Gabriel Petek emphasized that it’s too early to know for sure how badly the budget will fare but that the pandemic — and the economic uncertainty it causes — will “significantly affect California’s near-term fiscal outlook.”One issue is the state’s close financial ties to the stock market.California taxes capital gains or the positive amounts investors earn as regular income. That means when investors take a hit so does state revenue.In the governor’s $222.2 billion budget proposal released in January officials projected the price level for the S&P 500 stock index — which measures the market performance of 500 listed companies in the United States to gauge the overall health of the stock exchanges — would stay pretty flat. But after a slight upward swing late last year and into January the markets plummeted this month.Petek said by the office’s preliminary analysis that means several billion dollars less will flow into state coffers than what was initially projected in the Newsom's budget. That revenue crunch is further complicated by the “suddenness of the pullback in activity across wide swaths of the economy"" Petek wrote. The timing is tricky as the emergency response falls just weeks ahead of the deadline for the governor’s May budget revise. Along with a two-month extension given to taxpayers who can now file through July 15 that “will further complicate the task of developing revised revenue estimates” the government will have to significantly change legislative priorities presenting new “logistical challenges” Petek wrote.The constitutional deadline to pass the budget is June 15 and amid so much uncertainty righting the ship won’t be easy — especially with an extended need for emergency spending.It’s not all bad news out of the analyst's office though.Analysts have left room for the possibility of a “V-shaped recovery” where financial activity spikes back to normal levels just as rapidly as it sank with the help of state and federal stimulus. California was after all on good footing going into the crisis. In recent years the state prioritized paying down its debt and stashed surplus cash in its rainy day fund.“We were in a good place in a number of areas” said Jacobs. “There are resources to be able to respond and that’s central to being able to keep things going — being able to keep safety net programs going and respond to the emergencies” he said. “That is very big.”California Gov. Gavin Newsom speaks to reporters about the state’s response to the coronavirus during a news conference in Sacramento Calif. Newsom a Democrat who leads the nation’s most populous state has won praise from both sides of the aisle for his approach to the crisis though he’s been less aggressive than some other governors and local leaders.Newsom echoed this point during a March 15 news conference assuring the public that he is confident in the state’s position despite the uncertainty that lies ahead.“We’ve never been in a better position to weather a recession” Newsom said explaining that his team has projected a three-year $70billion reduction in revenue and a $40 billion reduction in the general fund.“We are better position I think than the vast majority of states in the country” he added saying that he expects federal support and the state’s ability to quickly change spending priorities to play a big role. California has had to maneuver around recessions in the past — and even rewrote its budget three times during the 2008 financial collapse. The ability to bounce back will likely hinge on just how long it takes to contain the virus. Economic systems can sustain short periods of shock and as Christopher Thornberg founder of Beacon Economics told Politico regions tend to recover quickly from natural disasters.  “It’s spending delayed not spending canceled” Thornberg said likening four weeks of coronavirus shut down to a hurricane. “But to be clear if this goes 40 weeks California is not in a good position” he added. “Our revenue system in the state is so hypersensitive to shifts in capital gains that if the stock market really did stay down where it is right now we’re going to take a massive hit.”Emergency managers are finding however that this disaster poses new problems.“We are in response mode right now and we are going to be in response mode for many months” said Samantha Montano an expert in emergency management whose debut book “Disasterology” is forthcoming. She noted that the coronavirus emergency is unusual compared to other disasters because it's not geographically isolated and that it is expected to stretch over a longer period of time. “Usually you are looking at a response that lasts a couple of days — or a couple of weeks at most” she adds. “To have this really long period of response which looks a lot different than moving into a period of recovery to be activated to that extent is really unprecedented.”The feds will need to play a big role As in most disasters California will look to the federal government for help. Newsom has already requested $1 billion from Trump to help finance his response efforts.The president has also made two declarations and both will provide much-needed resources for the state to take on this crisis. First on March 13 he declared a national state of emergency. He also granted Newsom’s request to declare a major disaster for California on March 22. New York and Washington also have been granted declarations.California and other states and territories that receive the declarations can bill some of their emergency expenses to the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency. Typically the state is expected to cover 25% of the expenses with the remaining 75% covered by the federal government. FEMA staff are also deployed to disaster areas and affected businesses can qualify for low-interest loans from the federal Small Business Administration.But it is still unclear just how much money California will get.In recent years the federal government has sought to limit the burden it shoulders especially facing increasingly expensive disasters. FEMA has floated a policy that would require states to have disaster deductibles to curb federal expenses.Sometimes though FEMA reimburses states for more. The process is murky and complicated — and adds even more uncertainty to an already financially precarious situation. Jacobs said the extent that the federal government decides to support California will determine just how economically devastating this disaster will be.“If the federal government doesn’t step in in a very big way right now — not just with general stimulus but with targeted support for workers and small businesses that are directly affected —we could see a very changed economy coming out on the other side” he said adding that he thinks the Newsom administration’s response has been impressive so far. “There are clearly things the state can and should be doing but we really will need the federal government to step up in a big way.”Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi D-California is pictured delivering a statement ahead of early Saturday's coronavirus aid package deal.On Wednesday the Senate passed a historic $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill hoping to curb the expected economic contraction caused by the outbreak. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R-Ky. likened the spending to ""a wartime level of investment for our nation."" The House is scheduled to vote on Friday and is expected to quickly send it on to the president to sign. If the bill passes Americans could soon will be getting direct payments from the federal government. Most individuals making under $75000 will receive $1200 with an additional $500 per child. Married couples earning $150000 or less would receive $2400. Those in higher income brackets will receive less with a hard-stop for anyone earning above $99000 or married couples with combined salaries above $198000.The bill also provides about $350 billion in new aid to small businesses $500 billion for corporations $100 billion in direct assistance to hospitals and roughly $150 billion for state stimulus. On Wednesday Newsom announced that California would receive $10 billion from Congress in state block grants. About $5.5 billion of that would go toward statewide efforts with the remainder going directly to cities and counties. “This bill will be very helpful and is very timely"" Newsom said as the state prepares to allocate billions to secure the safety of the people of California. Trump has wavered on his approach to the crisis— vacillating between assuring the public that the outbreak will quickly be contained and cautioning Americans that the country may have to undergo long-term distancing to stop the spread.This week he called for the country to reopen by Easter — April 12 —oft repeating that he doesn't want the ""cure"" to be worse than the disease.Public health officials warn that prematurely lifting social distancing orders could raisethe death toll considerably and will do little to stave off recession as the economic effects will magnify if outbreak explodes. Newsom has chosen a different path for the state of California telling residents that the next 8-12 weeks will be crucial to containing the virus. His stringent orders to remain at home he stressed will limit the most devastating consequences that could come from this outbreak. ""This is a dynamic situation"" he said during a livestreamed press conference conceding that he and Trump ""are moving in a different direction."" But he emphasized that in conversations and with the ""significant support and resources"" promised by the president suggest ""an understanding of the unique situation the state is in."""
64,Coronavirus cases continue to climb in military as all sailors on USS Theodore Roosevelt to be tested,Tom Vanden Brook,USA Today,0,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/26/coronavirus-navy-test-all-sailors-roosevelt-cases-grow/2920634001/,"WASHINGTON – Cases of coronavirus multiplied rapidly aboard the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt on Thursday as 15 more sailors tested positive prompting testing for all 5000 sailors aboard according to Navy and Defense officials.The Navy first reported Tuesday that three sailors had tested positive and been airlifted to a hospital in the Pacific. Five more sailors were diagnosed on Wednesday. By Thursday as the ship docked in Guam for a scheduled visit that number had jumped to 23 sailors according to a Defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly.""We expect additional positive tests and those sailors who test positive will be transported to the U.S. Naval Hospital Guam for further evaluation and treatment as necessary"" Adm. Michael Gilday chief of naval operations said in a statement. ""During the port visit base access will be limited to the pier for Roosevelt's sailors. No base or regional personnel will access the pier.""Military readiness:Coronavirus forces cuts to training recruiting creating strainsThe Naval Hospital Guam in Agana Heights on Thursday March 26 2020.None of the sailors so far have been hospitalized or are seriously ill Gilday said.Across the military officials scrambled Thursday to corral the virus before it rampages through the ranks and limits the Pentagon's ability to meet challenges from adversaries. Cases of COVID-19 continued to rise on Wednesday reaching 574 cases among troops their families and civilian employees the Pentagon reported. That compares with 415 on Tuesday an increase of 38%.Lt. Gen. R. Scott Dingle the Army surgeon general told reporters Thursday that he was ""absolutely concerned"" that coronavirus could damage the military's readiness to accomplish its missions. By Thursday afternoon the Army had counted 100 soldiers with coronavirus according to Gen. James McConville the Army chief of staff. Concerned that it could spread further McConville on Wednesday ordered the Army's fast-reaction forces to comply with the Health Protection Condition Delta its strictest measure. That keeps soldiers at home limiting them to essential trips such as the grocery store and pharmacy. The concept he said was to create a ""safety bubble"" around soldiers most likely needed for combat missions.Throughout the Army major training exercises have been canceled and social distancing is being implemented. Doing so should limit spread of the virus and allow the Army to return to more normal operations by summer Dingle said. Back in Guam the Roosevelt and its crew will be confined to the pier during their visit. Deep cleaning of the ship is underway and testing has begun for each sailor.Gilday made clear that the Roosevelt remained capable of its missions which in the Pacific include deterring aggression from North Korea and matching the strength of Chinese naval forces.""We are confident that our aggressive response will keep USS Theodore Roosevelt able to respond to any crisis in the region"" Gilday said."
65,Coronavirus stimulus package: Who will get $1200 checks and when will they be sent out?,Michael Collins,USA Today,0,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/26/coronavirus-americans-start-getting-stimulus-checks-three-weeks/5078658002/,WASHINGTON – The checks are coming.One-time payments of up to $1200 should start going out in the next three weeks to most Americans who file individual tax returns Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says. Those who file joint tax returns will get up to $2400.The payments are part of a $2 trillion recovery package negotiated by the White House and congressional leaders to help Americans – and the economy – bounce back from the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. The Senate passed the package Wednesday and the House is expected to approve it Friday.The payments will be sent via direct deposit to Americans who already have provided the Internal Revenue Service with their bank account information. For those who haven’t the checks will be mailed.Some tax experts question whether the government will be able to meet its three-week timeline for distributing the checks. The wait may be longer for Americans who will get their checks through the mail said Kyle Pomerleau of the American Enterprise Institute.“It’s going to take longer for the IRS to process (physical checks) print them and send them” Pomerleau said.Stimulus package:How a divided Congress united behind a $2 trillion package to confront the coronavirus crisisU.S. Treasury checksSo how much money should you expect?It depends on how much you’ve earned in the past two years.If you've already filed your 2019 taxes the IRS will use those returns to determine your rebate. If not your 2018 returns will be used to calculate your check.Individuals with an adjusted gross income of $75000 or less will be eligible for up to $1200 ($2400 for joint tax returns) and $500 for each qualifying child. Those with little or no tax liability will get at least $600 ($1200 for joint returns.)Investment opportunity:Plan to save that upcoming stimulus check? You might want to investThe payments will start to phase out for Americans who earn more than $75000 or $150000 for a joint return. The amount you receive will be decreased by 5% of the amount your income exceeds $75000. For example a single person with an $85000 salary would get $700 after subtracting 5% of $10000 or $500.The payments will phase out completely for single filers with incomes exceeding $99000 $146500 for head of household filers with one child and $198000 for joint filers with no children.You don’t have to apply to receive the money. If you’ve filed income taxes in the past two years you will automatically get a check.Another bonus? The checks aren’t taxable.

The president said expanded testing capabilities will allow the administration to coordinate with the country's patchwork of health officials to target counties that continue to pose risks of spreading the virus. Through ""surveillance testing"" he said health officials will categorize these counties as ""high-risk medium-risk or low-risk."" ""There is still a long battle ahead but our efforts are already paying dividends"" Trump wrote. ""As we enhance protections against the virus Americans across the county are hoping the day will soon arrive when they can resume their normal economic social and religious lives."" Trump has said he'd like to see the country ""back to work"" by Easter Sunday April 12 as fallout over the spread of the coronavirus continues to cripple the U.S. economy. The president has suggested that harder-hit areas would remain under White House coronavirus task force social distancing guidelines while other regions could resume public life. But the president's strategy appears at odds with dozens of state and local officials who continue to implement more stringent orders to stay at home or close nonessential businesses amid the outbreak. Some governors have indicated they only plan to lift some of those restrictions when health officials say it's safe to do so. ""You can't put a timeline on saving people's lives"" Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan told reporters Wednesday. The Republican governor who chairs the National Governors Association added: ""We're going to make decisions based on the scientists and the facts.""Trump participated in a video teleconference call with the country's governors and Vice President Mike Pence earlier on Thursday.

House Democratic leaders said last night they would pass it on Friday morning.The House Speaker also laid out her priorities for another coronavirus bill:A ""better definition of who qualifies for family and medical leave.""Stronger OSHA protections.Shoring up pensions.Increased SNAP benefits.More money for state and local governments including Washington D.C.Increased coverage for testing doctor's visits and treatments after a doctor's visit for coronavirus.""There’s so many things we didn’t get in any of these bills yet in the way that we need to"" she said.- Nicholas Wu and Maureen GroppeTrump campaign seeks to block political ad critical of coronavirus responsePresident Donald Trump's re-election campaign has sent a cease-and-desist letter to a pro-Democratic political action committee over an ad that attacks his response to the spread of coronavirus though the Super PAC says it will continue sponsoring the spot.Priorities USA Action Fund put up the ad entitled ""Exponential Threat"" which replays Trump comments downplaying the coronavirus threat in January and February even as the number of cases and deaths in the United States rose.In its letter of complaint the Trump campaign says the ad is ""false misleading and deceptive"" in implying that the president described the virus itself as a ""hoax.""""The facts show beyond reasonable doubt that he was talking about the Democrats' politicization of the outbreak when he used the word 'hoax'"" the letter said.Patrick McHugh executive director of Priorities USA said a pro-Trump Super PAC is also threatening his organization and that they and the Trump campaign ""are resorting to desperate threats to keep Americans from hearing the truth about his failed COVID response"" that has put all Americans at risk.""The ads are still running and Priorities USA will continue ensuring voters hear the truth"" McHugh said.The pro-Trump groups would have to go to court to get the ads stopped.- David JacksonMnuchin: unemployment numbers 'aren't relevant'Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is downplaying record-setting jobless claims recorded last week saying employment will bounce back after the threat of the coronavirus passes.“To be honest I think these numbers right now aren’t relevant whether they’re bigger or smaller in the short term” Mnuchin said in a telephone interview on CNBC.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif. delivers a statement at the U.S. Capitol on Monday.Mnuchin who represented the White House in negotiations on a massive stimulus deal the Senate passed Wednesday spoke shortly after the Labor Department announced the number of jobless claims filed the week ending March 21 hit 3.3 million – a record-shattering number.The overall unemployment rate – which has hit record lows recently and was expected to be a major plank in President Donald Trump's re-election bid – is also expected to soar in the coming weeks and months.In his CNBC interview Mnuchin predicted that businesses will start re-hiring as the epidemic passes thanks in part to the $2 trillion stimulus bill now pending in Congress.Gary Cohn the former director of the National Economic Council under Trump appeared to hit Mnuchin for his use of the term ""relevant.""""The 3+ million unemployment claims were expected but are very relevant"" Cohn tweeted. ""Each represents a dire situation.""Cohn like Mnuchin urged the House to pass the stimulus bill that includes aid to the unemployed and ""get it distributed immediately.""- David JacksonPentagon: coronavirus cases increase 38% Cases of COVID-19 continued to rise on Wednesday reaching 574 cases among troops their families and civilian employees the Pentagon reported Thursday. That compares with 415 on Tuesday an increase of 38%.Troops had the largest share of cases with 280 ill with the disease. Its spread among the ranks prompted Defense Secretary Mark Esper late Wednesday to halt travel for all troops and their families for 60 days essentially ordering them to shelter in place. The order will affect about 90000 troops whose deployments and moves to new posts will be postponed.Wednesday also saw the first case of COVID-19 inside the Pentagon the headquarters of the U.S. military. A Marine tested positive for the coronavirus and his workplace was sanitized by a dedicated team. Pentagon officials are determining the Marine’s contacts with others.At sea the Navy is dealing with an outbreak on the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt. On Tuesday three sailors tested positive for the virus and were flown from the ship which is operating in the Pacific. Five more sailors were found infected on Wednesday and they too were airlifted to a military hospital. Navy officials are tracing their contacts among the 5000 sailors aboard the Roosevelt.- Tom Vanden BrookTrump G-20 leaders hold video conference on coronavirusPresident Donald Trump and other leaders of the Group of 20 nations – the G-20 – met by video conference Thursday to discuss some kind of global response to the coronavirus pandemic.World Health Organization Director General Tedros Ghebreyesus was scheduled to address the group about the need to finance and produce more personal protection equipment like masks and gloves for besieged medical workers across the globe.The event was closed to the press.The current G-20 chairman King Salman of Saudi Arabia said he called the ""virtual summit"" to work on a ""global response"" to the outbreak.""As the world confronts the COVID-19 pandemic and the challenges to healthcare systems and the global economy we convene this extraordinary G20 summit to unite efforts towards a global response"" he tweeted before the meeting. ""May God spare humanity from all harm.""The conference came a day after another international economic group – the Group of Seven industrialized nations or G-7 – failed to agree on a joint statement about coronavirus.The reason: U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo insisted on referring to the epidemic as the ""Wuhan virus"" saying China has a special responsibility to address the impact of the disease because it started in that country. Other G-7 members called the designation needlessly provocative.- David JacksonPelosi's 80th birthday comes ahead of big House voteHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi celebrated her 80th birthday Thursday getting ready to shepherd the biggest economic bill in history through the U.S. House she leads. The Senate version of the coronavirus relief bill turned out to be 880 pages long presumably a coincidence and not a tribute.Eighty years ago news of her birth the daughter of a first-term Baltimore congressman also made headlines in the local press. It was a time though that any thoughts of a political dynasty focused on her five older brothers not on the only girl in the family. “It’s a Girl for the D’Alesandro’s” The Baltimore News-Post headline declared over a four-column photo at the top of the front page that showed the swaddled newborn only hours after she was born at the city’s St. Joseph Hospital. The Baltimore Sun took a more political tilt: “Tommy D’Alesandro Announces Another Sure Vote – It’s a Girl.” The Baltimore Guide offered a prediction that in retrospect seems practically prescient. “D’Alesandro Will Find New Boss in First Daughter” it said adding “We predict that this little lady will soon be a ‘Queen’ in her own right.”- Susan PageSenate passes coronavirus package. House to vote FridayThe Senate passed a $2 trillion economic rescue package – the largest such measure in U.S. history – just before midnight on Wednesday in response to the coronavirus outbreak. The measure now heads to the House which is expected to vote on the measure Friday. ""Congratulations AMERICA!"" President Donald Trump tweeted after the measure was approved in a 96-0 vote following days of heated debate. Two earlier efforts to introduce the initial version of the bill failed to make it to a final vote before Democrats agreed to the current package. Trump plans to sign the bill once it clears the House where Majority Leader Steny Hoyer D-Md. said it is expected to pass when the body reconvenes at 9 a.m. EDT on Friday. The third and largest economic aid package out of Congress since the coronavirus outbreak began includes one-time payments of $1200 to individuals making less than $75000 as well as $500 per child $367 billion for small businesses more than $130 billion toward the health care system expanded unemployment benefits and $500 billion in loans for ailing industries. Full text:The $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill releasedThe virus has spread to all 50 states and the U.S. now trails only China and Italy in confirmed cases which now number nearly 70000. One thousand people have died as of Thursday morning but that number is expected to rise in the coming days and weeks. Businesses across the country have shutdown in an effort to stop the spread of the virus. The aid package aims to lift some of the burden on small businesses that are fighting to avoid collapse amid the crisis and the workers who won't be collecting paychecks. A Labor Department report on Thursday will reveal the number of people who filed for unemployment benefits after the outbreak.– William CummingsFed chairman: 'We may well be in a recession'Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the economy may be in recession as a result of the coronavirus pandemic but has potential to rebound depending on how quickly the virus is contained.During an interview with NBC's Today show Powell said the economy was in a strong position before the COVID-19 outbreak spread in the United States citing 50-year lows in unemployment.""We may well be in a recession"" said Powell during the interview but added this recession is different from normal and there is nothing ""fundamentally wrong"" with the economy.""This is a situation where people are being asked to step back from economic activity close their businesses stay home from work"" said Powell. ""In principle if we get the virus spread under control fairly quickly then economic activity can resume and we want to make that rebound as vigorous as possible.""- Brett Molina"
67,Americans divided on Trump coronavirus response as president's approval rating climbs polls find,William Cummings,USA Today,0,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/26/trump-coronavirus-response-polls/2914418001/,"WASHINGTON – Americans are divided on President Donald Trump's response to the coronavirus outbreak which has killed more than 1000 in the U.S. and caused economic devastation according to recent polls. A Reuters/Ipsos online survey of more than 4000 Americans found 49% approve of Trump's handling of the COVID-19 crisis while 44% disapproved.Those results largely fell along party lines. Republicans approved of the president's response 83%-13% while Democrats disapproved 71%-24%. Independents were split 43%-43%. An Economist/YouGov poll also found that 49% approve of Trump's management of the outbreak with 44% saying they disapprove. And as with the Reuters poll the opinions largely fell along party lines.Eighty-nine percent of registered Republicans said they approved of Trump's response while only 7% said they disapproved. Among Democrats 74% said they disapproved while 21% approved. Independents were divided: 42% approved and 45% disapproved. Live updates:House ready to OK $2 trillion coronavirus package on Friday after approval by SenateTrump's opponents have sharply criticized the president's handling of the outbreak which now has grown to about 70000 confirmed cases in the U.S. They argue that the administration should have pushed for tests to be available sooner and that federal agencies should have been preparing for an outbreak earlier. The president on the other hand has given himself high marks for his response particularly his decision to shut down travel from the area of China where the virus first appeared. He said that move saved thousands of lives. The Reuters and Economist polls contrasted with other recent surveys that appeared to show voters were rallying behind the president amid the crisis. A Gallup poll released Tuesday found 60% of Americans thought Trump was doing a good job of dealing with the pandemic while 38% disapproved. And an ABC News/Ipsos poll released Friday found 55% approved of Trump's response a 12-percentage-point improvement over the week before. $1200 checks help for businesses:Here's what's in the historic stimulus package for coronavirusLike the other polls the Gallup results fell along party lines but the survey found that Trump's job approval rating jumped 8 percentage points among independents and 6 points among Democrats from its previous poll. Gallup noted that was unusual for the president and attributed that climb to a ""rally effect"" often seen when the nation is in crisis.And Trump's overall job approval rating has climbed in other polls as well. According to RealClearPolitics his average approval rating is at 47% the highest level of his presidency. Similarly the polling site FiveThirtyEight has him at approval levels close to those he enjoyed during his first months in office. If Trump's approval is rising because of a ""rally effect"" it is modest compared with the rise in support for other recent presidents dealing with crises. After the Sept. 11 2001 terror attacks President George W. Bush's approval rating spiked 35 percentage points according to Gallup. ""There is a rally effect happening but the rally is extraordinarily weak compared to other modern presidents"" Larry Sabato the director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics told USA TODAY.""Incredibly Trump still hasn’t crossed the 50% mark in job approval – a much more important measure than public views about Trump’s handling of the pandemic. Why is that? Americans either love Trump or hate Trump and the vast majority will never change their evaluation.""And Trump still slightly trails the likely Democratic nominee former Vice President Joe Biden in a general election matchup according to the polls. The Reuters survey found Biden leading Trump 42%-36% in a hypothetical matchup (8% were undecided). The Economist poll found Biden ahead 46%-42% in a hypothetical matchup. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was done March 18-24 with a margin of error of plus or minus 1.7 percentage points. The Economist/YouGov poll was done March 22-24 with a margin of error of 3.2 percentage points. The Gallup poll was taken March 13-22 with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points."
68,How a divided Congress united behind a $2 trillion package to confront the coronavirus crisis,Ledyard KingChristal HayesCourtney Subramanian,USA Today,0,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/26/coronavirus-how-divided-congress-united-behind-2-trillion-stimulus/5079083002/,"WASHINGTON – Congress could not have been more fractured after last month’s bitterly partisan impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.Prospects that Republicans and Democrats could work together on anything of substance seemed far-fetched especially given the simmering feud between Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif.Then the coronavirus showed up on America’s doorstep.A bipartisan spirit – borne of necessity – emerged. Within weeks congressional leaders working hand-in-hand with administration officials forged a deal on a historic federal response to a pandemic that has killed hundreds walloped the economy and derailed America’s daily routines.Late Wednesday the Senate voted 96-0 to pass a $2 trillion relief package that would provide checks of up to $1200 for most adults give billions in potentially forgivable loans to small businesses and rescue the battered airlines industry. The House is likely to take the bill up Friday and pass it.Weeks after slamming Democrats for impeaching Trump Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the overwhelming passage of the coronavirus relief bill Wednesday a ""proud moment"" for the U.S. Senate.""If I were writing your headline I’d say the Senate has pivoted from one of the most contentious partisan periods in the nation’s history to passing this rescue package (unanimously) all in one quarter of this year"" he told reporters. It ""says a lot about the United States Senate as an institution our willingness to put aside our differences to do something really significant for the country.""Coronavirus live updates: Half of New Yorkers could face infection; details coming on $2 trillion stimulus; Prince Charles sickCollege debt:Student loan borrowers will see coronavirus relief from wage garnishments collectionsHow were lawmakers able to – mostly – set aside partisan differences so quickly? They had no choice said Sen. Marco Rubio R-Fla. who joined others in comparing the virus’ devastation to war.“It really is important for us to realize not just for this bill but moving forward that there's no such thing as an outcome here that's good for half of us and bad for the other half” he said on the Senate floor Wednesday. “There is no possible political victory here. None.”Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R-Ky. left and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer D-N.Y. were able to work together on the federal coronavirus response.Compromise was complicated by the hostility between Pelosi and Trump (neither has spoken to the other since mid-October when she upbraided him in a White House meeting over his Syria policy.).Negotiations weren't helped when the virus began infecting members of Congress and forced social distancing in a Capitol known for glad-handing and face-to-face discussions. Nearly three dozen House and Senate lawmakers and even more staff have self-quarantined either because they tested positive for COVID-19 or said they'd been exposed to it.Seeing members fall victim to the virus or its consequences might have reinforced the urgency. The White House sidestepped political friction by appointing Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin as the unassuming and affable point person on negotiations.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin helped in negotiations over the coronavirus legislation.Mnuchin and Pelosi spoke frequently this month as they crafted a smaller relief package that promised free coronavirus testing to all Americans and guaranteed two weeks of sick leave for workers affected by the crisis.As soon as that passed Mnuchin returned to the Capitol for round-the-clock negotiations with Senate leaders Mitch McConnell R-Ky. and Chuck Schumer D-N.Y. on the sweeping $2 trillion stimulus.When Mnuchin spoke from the podium at a White House news conference Wednesday he not only thanked his political ally McConnell but also Schumer ""for the enormous bipartisan support we have"" for the bill.That night in the same chamber that voted almost entirely along party lines last month to acquit the president at his impeachment trial much of the discussion was about the remarkable act of unity that produced the sweeping compromise and its overwhelming approval by the Senate.""Representatives from both sides of the aisle and both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue have forged a bipartisan agreement in highly partisan times with very little time to spare"" Schumer said before the vote. ""Its been a long hard road with a remarkable number of twists and turns but for the sake of millions of Americans it will be worth it.”Pelosi who described her relationship with Mnuchin as ""professional"" and ""respectful"" has worked with him on other big deals including a two-year extension of the debt limit and spending caps in July. Rep. Peter Welch D-Vt. said the Treasury secretary “has been very cooperative” with Democrats.The result of the bipartisan partnership was a bill so expansive it carries a price tag more than half the $3.5 trillion the IRS was expected to collect in tax revenue this year.At roughly $2 trillion the measure has something for almost everyone in Congress a legislative bromide that helped soothe partisan heartburn for all but those lawmakers who still fret about the soaring federal debt.Park closures:These national and state parks are closed amid coronavirus outbreakRoyal mess:Prince Charles' coronavirus diagnosis is a huge deal for Brits the monarchy. Here's why.Democrats won protections for workers students facing college debt defaults and low-income families at risk of eviction. Republicans secured lifelines for airlines small businesses and other industries rocked by the economic fallout. Both sides liked the idea of direct payments to help constituents back home.Among the provisions:$1200 cash assistance for individuals $2400 for married couples and $500 for each eligible child. This money would be available within three weeks of the bill's passage for all U.S. residents with an income up to $75000 including those with no income or who depend on Social Security.Unemployment insurance benefits would be expanded increasing the maximum benefit by $600 a week for up to four months. Benefits would be available to workers who are part-time self-employed or part of the gig economy. People who are still unemployed after state benefits end could get an additional 13 weeks of help.More than $100 billion for hospitals and medical centers to handle surging caseloads.Food assistance programs would get a boost as would programs to help low-income households avoid eviction and a program to improve internet access in rural areas.Small businesses would have access to a nearly $350 billion loan program to cover monthly expenses such as payroll rent and utilities. The loans would not have to be repaid if businesses maintained their workforce.Tax credits for companies that keep on workers despite a significant loss of revenue.A financial lifeline to the hardest-hit industries including passenger and cargo airlines. Another pot of money would be available to help other businesses for a combined $500 billion.$150 billion to help state and local governments which have had major unanticipated expenses while losing revenue.""Whether it is enough or whether it is a mere bandage depends on how long the pandemic will last"" said Peter Koveos a professor of finance at Syracuse University’s Whitman School of Management. ""It gives people some hope and the revelation that the government still functions. We will pay for this later but the cost will be even greater if we do nothing now.”"
69,Feds to expand home confinement for elderly inmates to avoid larger coronavirus outbreak,Kevin Johnson,USA Today,0,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/26/feds-expand-home-confinement-elderly-inmates/2916853001/,"Attorney General William Barr has directed federal prison authorities to begin identifying more elderly and medically compromised inmates for home confinement to avoid a larger outbreak of the coronavirus inside the agency's 122 institutions.Barr's directive comes as lawmakers and civil rights advocates have urged the Justice Department in recent days to reduce the number of vulnerable prisoners who would be most at risk of infection inside the nation's largest detention system.As of Thursday officials reported that six inmates and four staffers have been infected with the virus. Barr said that one of the inmates a prisoner in Louisiana was in critical condition. Barr acknowledged that there were rising ""concerns"" for the plight of the 170000 federal prisoners and the 36000 staffers who are in regular and close contact with the inmates everyday.While the attorney expressed confidence in the agency's capacity shield prisoners from disease he said ""there are some at-risk inmates who are non-violent and pose minimal likelihood of recidivism and who might be safer serving their sentences in home confinement rather than in BOP facilities.""This photo taken on February 13 2019 shows a view of the United States Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility also known as the ADX or ""Supermax"" in Florence Colorado.Describing the risk of a prison outbreak to ""a fire in a dry barn"" some conservative groups including the American Conservative Union had called on the president to intervene. The groups urged the president to issue an executive order allowing the elderly and non-violent offenders who have served two-thirds of their sentences to complete their terms at home. President Donald Trump said Sunday that the administration had been considering such a move. Barr's directive the first indication that the government had put a plan in motion.“We commend the Department of Justice and federal Bureau of Prisons for heeding the call of public health experts and working to reduce the federal prison population"" Kanya Bennett senior legislative counsel for the ACLU. ""Everyone agrees that the very nature of the criminal legal system puts vulnerable populations at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19.”  Jessica Jackson chief advocacy officer for the REFORM Alliance which supports prison reduction efforts said the attorney general's directive could ""save lives.”“Protecting vulnerable incarcerated people from exposure to COVID-19 is not just good for their safety but also for others behind bars and correctional staff who are at risk of spreading the disease back into their communities"" Jackson said. The attorney general said there were about 10000 prisoners 60 or older. But decisions on release could be complicated as about 40% of those are serving terms for violent crimes and sex offenses and who would not be eligible for release under terms of Thursday's directive. In a letter earlier this week to Barr and Bureau of Prisons Director Michael Carvajal a group of senators led by Charles Grassley R-Iowa and Richard Durbin D-Ill. urged the government to begin moving the elderly and terminally ill from custody.""Conditions of confinement do not afford individuals the opportunity to take proactive steps to protect themselves and prisons often create the ideal environment for the transmission of contagious disease"" the senators wrote. ""For these reasons it is important that consistent with the law and taking into account public safety and health concerns that the most vulnerable inmates are released or transferred to home confinement if possible.""Federal prison officials who earlier this month halted all visitation said Tuesday that they will now quarantine all new prisoners for 14 days in a further effort to limit the virus' spread.While the federal government was just launching its effort to reduce the prison population local and state governments have been releasing waves of prisoners from its jails and prisons to reduce the risk of infection and create additional space to quarantine infected prisoners.The largest such effort was underway in New Jersey where hundreds of prisoners were expected to exit county jails this week under an order issued by Supreme Court Chief Justice Stuart Rabner. The ACLU estimated that the New Jersey releases could reach 1000."

71,House Ponders How to Pass Stimulus Without Spreading Coronavirus,Natalie Andrews,The Wall Street Journal,0,https://www.wsj.com/articles/house-ponders-how-to-pass-stimulus-without-spreading-coronavirus-11585245569,WASHINGTON—House leaders are working on a plan to pass the largest stimulus package ever moved through Congress without convening the full 435-member body in an effort to avoid spreading the novel coronavirus and sickening more members.The House is expected to consider the bill on Friday giving lawmakers time to review the $2 trillion legislation and return to Washington. Congress’s attending physician has cautioned members to use extreme care and deliberation when deciding whether to travel.The bill which passed the Senate late Wednesday is the largest economic-relief package in history and will extend aid to many struggling Americans through direct payments and expanded unemployment insurance which also cover freelance and gig workers. It will give loans and grants to businesses refill drained state coffers and send additional resources to sapped health-care providers.The risk of contagion has prompted Congress to examine its own voting and social practices which often put members in physical proximity. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D. Calif.) plans to hold a voice vote on the legislation on Friday which won’t require all members to be present. Both Mrs. Pelosi and President Trump said they expected the measure to be easily approved.“It will pass” she said Thursday. “It will pass with strong bipartisan support.”Mr. Trump credited the stimulus package for a surge in U.S. stocks this week saying economic uncertainty remained in the U.S. “but we’ve come a long way.”“We’re doing a really good job in terms of running this whole situation having to do with the virus” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House he and his administration were “doing a good job keeping very important people informed.”“There was a great fear” Mr. Trump said. “And a lot of good things are happening.”In a caucus call Thursday afternoon Democratic leaders leaned on lawmakers who could safely travel to do so to ensure there are enough votes to pass the bill as long as it wouldn’t jeopardize the health of members or their families.“Millions of Americans are waiting” for the help the bill could bring Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D. Md.) said on the call according to a Democratic aide.The House is expected to convene at 9 a.m. on Friday and debate the bill for two hours. Should a lawmaker use a procedural maneuver that requires a roll-call vote House Democrats could move the vote to Saturday to allow more members to travel to have a quorum the aide said.The office of Mr. Hoyer (D. Md.) sent a message to lawmakers Thursday encouraging those who won’t be in Washington to record video statements so they can express their views remotely. The statements will be shared on social media and on C-Span.House Sergeant at Arms Paul D. Irving and Brian Monahan Congress’s attending physician on Thursday directed lawmakers who aren’t involved in the floor debate to stay in their offices until the vote is called. They will be required to use hand sanitizer when entering and departing the chamber. Lawmakers were also cautioned against using elevators and told that no guests would be allowed.The Senate passed the legislation unanimously 96-0 late Wednesday night. Four Republican senators were out due to illness or exposure to coronavirus showing how lawmakers are being affected by the pandemic even as they pass legislation to combat it.Two House members have also tested positive for the virus and at least two others are awaiting results of Covid-19 tests after falling ill. Many lawmakers are in self-quarantine either after experiencing symptoms themselves or because of known exposure to someone who was sick.One of those members Rep. Ben McAdams has been reliant on oxygen support for his recovery. In a text-message interview from the hospital the Utah Democrat urged his colleagues from both parties to support the legislation while also counseling lawmakers to use caution.
72,Trump Administration to Issue Guidelines for Classifying U.S. Counties by Coronavirus Risk,Rebecca Ballhaus,The Wall Street Journal,0,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-to-issue-guidelines-for-classifying-areas-by-coronavirus-risk-11585248715,WASHINGTON—The Trump administration is planning to issue guidelines categorizing counties across the nation as high-risk medium-risk or low-risk to help state and local authorities decide whether to bolster or relax social distancing measures intended to combat the novel coronavirus.In a letter to governors on Thursday President Trump said the administration’s growing testing capabilities would enable it to publish in consultation with public-health officials and scientists criteria for classifying counties by risk in the hopes that some parts of the country may be able to return to work sooner than others.“This new information will drive the next phase in our war against this invisible enemy” he wrote. “As we enhance protections against the virus Americans across the country are hoping the day will soon arrive when they can resume their normal economic social and religious lives.”The letter to governors which the White House published after Mr. Trump spoke with governors on a teleconference Thursday afternoon comes as the president has expressed an increasing interest in reopening the economy in the coming weeks.In a briefing later Thursday Mr. Trump said he intended to start the process of relaxing social-distancing guidelines “pretty soon” and said the administration might tailor guidelines to specific parts of the country.“Our people want to go back to work. I’m hearing it loud and clear from everybody” he said. “They don’t want to sit around and wait.”Ambassador Deborah Birx special representative for global health said the administration wants to use a “laser-focused approach” to its social-distancing guidelines but said it needs “very clear data” at the state and county level to be able to do so. She declined to give a timeline for when she expected to have that level of data. Vice President Mike Pence moments later said advisers planned to present data to the president this weekend but didn’t offer specifics.Earlier this week the president said he hoped to have the economy “just raring to go” by Easter which falls on April 12 just under a month after the administration first issued its social-distancing guidelines. Public-health experts including some in the president’s own administration say it will take far longer—possibly months—before it is safe for the nation to return to work.On Wednesday Mr. Trump said in a briefing that “large sections” of the country could return to work far sooner than others though he pledged not to do anything “rash.” The president is also limited in his authority to reopen the country as the most severe restrictions on businesses have come from governors not the federal government.One major hurdle for the administration as it seeks to relax social-distancing guidelines in certain parts of the country: its ability to conduct enough testing to track the virus’s path. After initial delays the U.S. has seen a sharp uptick in the level of testing in recent days but its per capita rate of testing still falls far behind other countries that have been successful at clamping down on the virus’s spread according to publicly available data.The U.S. has so far conducted more than 400000 tests in a population of more than 320 million according to administration officials. To categorize every county’s risk level the country would need to ramp up testing on a much greater scale. There are 3141 U.S. counties and county equivalents according to the Interior Department’s U.S. Geological Survey.The pandemic also has struck U.S. counties unevenly. New York County which comprises the New York borough of Manhattan has more than 21000 confirmed cases more than a quarter of the national total while many counties have no cases at all.On Wednesday the president said he doesn’t see the value in testing broad swaths of the population.“If you’re saying we’re going to test 350 million people... we don’t have to test the entire state in the Middle West or wherever they may be. We don’t have to test the entire state” Mr. Trump said. “I think it’s ridiculous. We don’t have to do it.”In recent days White House advisers and public health experts have floated proposals that could allow Americans in some places to go back to work. Those include workplace testing of employees and intensified contact tracing to curb the spread of the infection according to people familiar with the planning. Their goal is to release a plan before Easter.Public-health experts said the president’s interest in relaxing social-distancing guidelines for some parts of the country and not others could make it harder to combat the virus’s spread. The U.S. because of its decentralized structure of government and health-care systems has faced greater hurdles than some Asian countries in implementing rigorous measures to test and quarantine citizens. Leaving social-distancing guidelines to governors’ discretion could result in a patchwork effort to contain the virus.One risk of opening up some parts of the country but not others is that in the absence of any domestic travel restrictions those from more infected areas will be able to continue traveling freely to other areas with fewer cases. The Trump administration earlier this week urged those leaving New York to self-isolate for 14 days but such guidelines are not being strictly enforced.Dr. Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease said Thursday that the U.S. “can start thinking about getting back to some degree of normality when the country as a whole turns that corner.”In an interview with NBA star Stephen Curry Dr. Fauci said that before measures can be relaxed “you need to see the trajectory of the curve start to come down.”In a CNN interview on Wednesday evening Dr. Fauci again suggested it wasn’t realistic to offer a date by which the nation would reopen.“You don’t make the timeline the virus makes the timeline” he said. “If you keep seeing this acceleration it doesn’t matter what you say. One week two weeks three weeks—you’ve got to go with what the situation on the ground is.”
73,Relief Package Would Limit Coronavirus Damage Not Restore Economy,Kate Davidson and Josh Mitchell,The Wall Street Journal,0,https://www.wsj.com/articles/relief-package-would-limit-coronavirus-damage-not-restore-economy-11585215006,WASHINGTON—The $2 trillion emergency relief package approved by the Senate would help stabilize the coronavirus-battered economy—but likely isn’t enough to bring it back to health.Preliminary data suggest that the U.S. economy is already shrinking as businesses close and unemployment soars. The depth of the economic decline in the coming months will depend on how quickly Washington can deliver checks to cash-strapped households and businesses as well as whether a treatment is found and how soon shutdowns are lifted economists saidIf passed the new law would provide loans and other disbursements to a wide swath of the economy including direct payments to Americans and loans to large and small companies. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D. Md.) the House majority leader said late Wednesday that the House would consider the stimulus bill on Friday. President Trump has said he would sign it immediately.“As big as this is you’ll never look back on this and say ‘We went too big.’ You’ll look back and say ‘What did we miss?’” said Diane Swonk chief economist at Grant Thornton.At more than 9% of gross domestic product the measure is larger than the three major packages enacted to counter the 2007-09 recession said Ernie Tedeschi an economist at Evercore ISI. Even so more will be needed he said.“The scale of the problem is accelerating and it’s moving faster than fiscal policy makers are acting” Mr. Tedeschi said.Economists at Moody’s Analytics predict the bill would limit the drop in second-quarter GDP to 17% at an annual rate. Without the legislation it would have fallen at a nearly 30% rate they estimate. For the year as a whole Moody’s expects output to decline by 2%.The measure provides for one-time payments of $1200 each to many Americans plus $500 per child with assistance limited to certain income levels. It expands unemployment insurance and includes $349 billion in loans to small businesses to help them pay workers and cover expenses.Another $500 billion would be available to the Treasury Department to make or guarantee loans to larger corporations including airlines either directly or through lending facilities established by the Federal Reserve.“All of these different measures are meant to plug the holes in the boat if you will as opposed to trying to speed things up” said Wells Fargo economist Michael Pugliese.Plugging the boat will take time. Trump administration officials said they hope to begin making the first payments to households within a few weeks. During the last downturn it took more than two months.“A lot of families and businesses can know that help is on the way” said Jason Furman a Harvard University economics professor and former chairman of President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers. “Hopefully they can hang on until the help gets there but the help is not going to come overnight.”Payments to households estimated to total $300 billion would likely come in waves first to people whose information the government already has such as federal benefit recipients and people who file regular tax returns. Harder to reach may be the most vulnerable: people who don’t file taxes because their income is too low.The payments might be delayed by the burden they place on an underfunded Internal Revenue Service with a workforce strained by the pandemic and unable to staff taxpayer assistance centers.Potentially one of the most helpful pieces of the bill economists said is a broad expansion in unemployment insurance. The measure would extend benefits to gig economy workers and freelancers and would increase current unemployment assistance by $600 a week for four months.A new program launched under the Small Business Administration would also take time to distribute $350 billion in loans to companies with fewer than 500 employees. Employers that keep paying workers through the downturn could have the loans forgiven.Once the program is established the SBA would then have to assess the eligibility of borrowers. Firms would need to prove the size of their workforce and their previous payroll expenses to determine loan sizes.Policy makers will probably revisit the programs later in the year to determine whether they have done enough.“The number of people that are hurt will be hurt longer than this package will last” said Ms. Swonk of Grant Thornton.Particularly concerning is the impact on state budgets later in the year Ms. Swonk said. The bill provides additional money to states for expenses related to the coronavirus but that might not be enough.A sharp rise in unemployment could cost states billions in lost revenues and higher benefits spending forcing them to scale back budgets for the next fiscal year and weighing on economic growth.“You don’t want to have this major setback just as you’re starting to ramp up” Ms. Swonk said.
74,Trump’s Popularity Ticks Up During Coronavirus Crisis,Aaron Zitner,The Wall Street Journal,0,https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-popularity-ticks-up-during-coronavirus-crisis-11585252376,ASHINGTON—More Americans are taking a favorable view of President Trump’s leadership as he navigates the novel coronavirus pandemic with some measures of support hitting or tying all-time highs.Approval of Mr. Trump’s handling of the outbreak has risen by 8 percentage points in weekly Economist/YouGov surveys over the course of March standing at 49% in a poll that ended Tuesday with 44% disapproving.Gallup surveys found Trump’s overall job approval rating at 49% in a survey that ended Sunday tying a record high he had hit earlier this year as the Senate took up impeachment. The president’s job approval rose to 45% its highest mark since early 2017 in a Pew Research Center survey released Thursday. An average of polls by Real Clear Politics finds Mr. Trump’s approval rating at 47% at or near a high with just under 50% disapproving.Americans typically rally behind their president during a national crisis.In this case some surveys find Americans optimistic but not fully confident the administration can navigate the crisis. Some 20% of respondents who said they approved of Mr. Trump’s handling of the outbreak in the latest Economist/YouGov poll were also “uneasy’’ or “not sure’’ when asked if he could “deal wisely’’ with the problem.“When you’re in the middle of a crisis there’s a willingness to take a step back from prior personal views and give the president an opportunity—any president not just Trump’’ said David Winston a Republican pollster and strategist.Other than the core supporters of each party he said “Americans are not thinking politically. They feel personally threatened and this is not a political dynamic.’’ For now he said Americans may support Mr. Trump while making no change in their broader political outlook or voting decisions.Stanley Greenberg a Democratic pollster described the boost in Mr. Trump’s ratings as modest. “It’s an uptick when it should be the country embracing him. ... He has not rallied the country’’ Mr. Greenberg said.Some polls support the idea that Mr. Trump’s higher approval ratings are not changing underlying views of him or his re-election at least so far.The president’s expected Democratic challenger Joe Biden has led Mr. Trump by about 4 percentage points in test match-ups through March in Economist/YouGov polling at the same time views of Mr. Trump’s work on the coronavirus issue brightened. Some polls have shown a wider margin. Mr. Biden led by 9 points in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey earlier this month.In an earlier era—from the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941 through the terror attacks of Sept. 11 2001—presidents received a boost of 10 points or more in their approval ratings amidst crises Gallup polling has found. President Kennedy’s rating jumped by 13 points during the Cuban missile crisis as did President Carter’s rating just after American hostages were seized in Iran. In both cases the boost lasted for months.Increased partisanship has made such spikes less common as presidents now win little support from members of the opposing party. Gallup reports that the biggest increases for President Obama and Mr. Trump were 7 percentage points—for Mr. Obama after U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden in 2011 and for Mr. Trump after a government shutdown ended in 2019.
75,Powell Says Economy May Be in Recession Virus Will Dictate Timetable,Nick Timiraos,The Wall Street Journal,0,https://www.wsj.com/articles/powell-says-economy-may-be-in-recession-virus-will-dictate-timetable-11585222769,Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy “may well be in a recession” but that the central bank is taking unprecedented action to help ensure economic activity can resume as soon as the coronavirus pandemic is under control.“The virus is going to dictate the timetable here” Mr. Powell said in a rare television interview on NBC’s “Today” show Thursday morning. “The first order of business will be to get the spread of the virus under control and then resume economic activity.”Mr. Powell said he expected economic activity to decline “pretty substantially” in the second quarter. The Fed’s job now he added is to make sure businesses of all sizes can have a “bridge” of support including through emergency lending programs the Fed has been rolling out so that the economy can recover faster.Fed officials are trying to prevent firms from losing access to funding which could then snowball turning what is shaping up to be a severe synchronized global recession into a full-bore depression.The Fed has slashed its benchmark rate to zero and unveiled a series of programs to boost lending. By Friday it will have also purchased nearly $1 trillion in Treasury and mortgage securities over the past two weeks.“Where credit is not flowing we have the ability in this unique circumstance to temporarily step in and provide those loans and we will keep doing that aggressively and forthrightly as we have been” said Mr. Powell.The Trump administration and Congress agreed Wednesday to provide $454 billion in additional funds for the Treasury to bulk up existing or new Fed lending facilities including programs to support small-business lending and shore up financing markets for state and local governments.“When it comes to this lending we’re not going to run out of ammunition. That doesn’t happen” Mr. Powell said.Mr. Powell said it was possible that for every dollar in support for lending that the Fed receives from the Treasury it could extend up to $10 in new loans. That means the latest legislation which has passed the Senate but not the House of Representatives could enable more than $4 trillion in lending programs.So far the Treasury has committed $50 billion to five separate Fed lending facilities by using an obscure pot of money available to the Treasury secretary called the Exchange Stabilization Fund that doesn’t require congressional approval.Mr. Powell said the timing of when economic activity can resume should be dictated by public-health experts. “This is a unique situation. It’s not like a typical downturn” he said. “We’ve asked people to step back from economic activity really to make an investment in our public health.”
76,What’s in the $2 Trillion Senate Coronavirus Bill,,The Wall Street Journal,0,https://www.wsj.com/articles/whats-in-the-2-trillion-senate-coronavirus-bill-11585185450,The $2 trillion emergency aid bill is nearing the finish line in Congress as lawmakers moved to cushion the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. The Senate passed the legislation Wednesday night and the House is set to take it up Friday. Here is a look at the major pieces of the package and how households and businesses are set to benefit based on where the legislation stood late Wednesday.We’ve broken it into four parts: the top lines households and workers business and banking and personal finance and taxes.THE TOP LINES• $250 billion to make unemployment insurance available to more categories of workers and to extend the duration of benefits to 39 weeks from the 26 weeks typical in most states. It would also provide an extra $600 a week for four months.• $301 billion in direct payments to households.• $349 billion in loans to small businesses with the amount spent on payroll rent or utilities converting into grants that don’t have to be repaid.• $500 billion for loans loan guarantees or other aid to businesses states and municipalities—including the possibility that the government will take direct equity stakes in distressed companies. Of the total $29 billion is set aside for cargo and passenger airlines and $17 billion is for businesses deemed critical to national security such as Boeing. The remaining $454 billion would go to backstop losses in lending facilities established or expanded by the Federal Reserve.• $32 billion in grants to cover wages at passenger air carriers cargo air carriers and contractors.• $150 billion in direct aid to states distributed according to population size. A municipality could apply to receive aid directly reducing the amount available to the rest of the state.• $221 billion in a variety of tax benefits for businesses including allowing businesses to defer payroll taxes which finance Medicare and Social Security for the rest of the year. It would also temporarily allow businesses to claim deductions using today’s losses against past profits to claim quick refunds for cash infusions.• $340 billion in supplemental spending which includes $117 billion for hospitals and veterans’ care. It also includes $25 billion mostly for public transit to make up for revenue lost because of dwindling ridership.HOUSEHOLDS AND WORKERSChecks to individualsThe bill provides for direct payments of $1200 to adults and $500 per child to American households structured as tax refunds to allow the Internal Revenue Service to distribute the funds quickly. There is no provision for future direct payments in the event the economic disruption lasts into the later spring. The direct grants are phased out for upper income brackets starting with $75000 of individual income. The grants aren’t available at all for example for individuals without children making more than $99000 and married couples without children making more than $198000. —Siobhan HughesUnemployed workersThe deal would extend the duration of jobless benefits to 39 weeks from 26 available in most states and includes a $600-a-week increase for the first four months with the bonus payment available through July 31. These benefits would be extended to contract workers freelancers and other nontraditional workers who lack benefits in some states. The aim is to replace lost wages as completely as possible. —Siobhan HughesGig workers and freelancersThe bill expands some benefits and grants to independent contractors such as Uber drivers and freelance film editors that normally go only to employees or small businesses. For example it extends unemployment benefits to self-employed workers including independent contractors freelancers and other nontraditional workers who are unemployed partially unemployed or unable to work because of Covid-19. It includes a $600-a-week increase on top of current levels of unemployment benefits for four months. Independent contractors also can apply for the $349 billion for small businesses and for $10 billion set aside for emergency EIDL—economic injury disaster loan—funds which are normally available only to a narrower category of small businesses. —Lauren WeberBUSINESS AND BANKINGAirlinesFor passenger airlines the bill includes $25 billion in direct funding for worker salaries and benefits as well as up to $25 billion in loans and loan guarantees. The bill hews to what airlines had been asking for. Carriers had lobbied aggressively for direct grants rather than just loans warning that without an immediate infusion of cash they would have to make sharp job cuts. “This is not a corporate bailout; it’s a rescue package for workers” Sara Nelson president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA said.The bill also includes $3 billion in assistance to keep paying contract workers that provide airline catering baggage loading ticketing and check-in and other services at airports. Cargo airlines will be eligible to receive $4 billion in loans and guarantees and $4 billion in payroll assistance.In exchange for the payroll grants carriers must agree not to furlough lay off or cut pay for employees until Sept. 30. Assistance also hinges on companies agreeing not to buy back shares or pay dividends and to limits on executive compensation.The package also allows the Transportation Department to direct airlines to maintain specific flights based on their schedules on March 1 before carriers had instituted the deepest cuts to their flying. This would include services to rural communities and to support delivery of health-care-related cargo. —Alison SiderAuto industryThe closure of nearly all of the country’s assembly plants has forced thousands of manufacturers throughout the industry’s supply chain into a sudden cash crunch. The bill’s authorization of up to hundreds of billions of dollars in loans should help. “If not for that I would foresee quite a bit of bankruptcies” said Jeremy Rice automotive practice lead at accounting firm Mazars U.S.A. One omission: Industry lobbyists have asked to push back implementation of the new North American trade deal which will require adjustments to manufacturing footprints for some cars to still qualify for duty-free status. As of now that deal is still set to enter into force on June 1. —Ben FoldyBanksThe bill delays implementation of a new accounting rule that would have required banks to sock away reserves for any estimated loan losses all at once instead of spreading them out over the life of the loan. FDIC Chairman Jelena McWilliams and others had expressed concern that the rule would tie up funds banks could otherwise lend to struggling consumers and businesses.The bill gives the office of the comptroller of the currency the authority to allow banks to make loans that would typically trip up size restrictions. Smaller community banks with less than $10 billion in assets get more lending flexibility through a higher maximum leverage ratio and more wiggle room if they exceed it.Banks will also get more leeway on how they account for troubled consumer loans allowing them to work with struggling borrowers who have fallen behind on their payments —David BenoitBoeingBoeing Co. stands to have access to $17 billion in loans and loan guarantees for “businesses critical to maintaining national security” according to congressional officials and a senior aviation industry executive closely tracking the legislation. The Chicago aerospace giant had sought at least $60 billion to be shared with suppliers and the broader aerospace manufacturing sector. It wasn’t immediately known how much of the overall stimulus funds could benefit Boeing’s commercial arm and its suppliers.Part of the $17 billion can be directed at defense contractors and their suppliers many of whom also work on commercial programs industry executives said.A Boeing spokesman declined to comment midday Wednesday while the legislative process remained under way.Taxpayer-funded loans would come with various conditions including restrictions on stock buybacks and dividends and layoff prohibitions for six months. The assistance could also allow the U.S. treasury secretary to take an equity stake in government loan recipients. —Andrew Tangel and Doug CameronEnergyThe bill contains no major provisions to specifically aid the U.S. energy industry. Beleaguered U.S. oil producers had sought a range of remedies including preferential tax treatment direct subsidies and a $3 billion purchase of oil by the federal government for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The renewable energy industry had sought extensions to tax provisions that would have helped wind-and-solar developers secure valuable tax credits even if there were construction delays. Industry officials expressed disappointment. Democrats were unwilling to support what they considered to be bailouts and Republicans balked at supporting renewables say energy industry analysts. —Christopher M. MatthewsFarmersThe bill directs more than $48 billion to agriculture and nutrition programs helping cushion the blow for producers reeling from the latest in a string of hits to the U.S. farm economy as prices sank for corn soybeans wheat and cattle. “Our markets have been very depressed such that it’s questionable whether a person can make a living at these levels” said Illinois grain farmer Paul Rasmussen 68.The law designates $14 billion to replenish the Commodity Credit Corp. a Depression-era program designed to stabilize farm incomes and $9.5 billion to support producers of specialty crops livestock and dairy as well as those who supply farmers markets restaurants and schools.Kate Leone of Feeding America a nationwide network of 200 food banks said the group was grateful for the bill’s support of food banks but disappointed that participants in the nation’s food stamp program wouldn’t see increases in their benefits. —Jesse Newman and Kirk MaltaisHealth industryThe stimulus package adds $27 billion to an emergency fund that could give a boost to dozens of projects by pharmaceutical companies and academic groups developing drugs and vaccines against coronavirus. The emergency fund received a smaller amount of funding under a coronavirus response act signed earlier in March. There is no Covid-19 vaccine but dozens are in development.The package allows the government to take steps to ensure that products developed with the emergency funding will be “affordable in the commercial market” but that these steps shouldn’t delay development of the products.The bill also includes provisions to increase reporting of potential shortages from drug manufacturers and companies that make active pharmaceutical ingredients which are the building blocks of prescription drugs. Many of these raw materials are produced overseas and drawn more attention during the virus outbreak. Companies that make respirators and other medical devices would be required to report to the federal government potential supply chain interruptions. —Peter Loftus and Jared S. HopkinsHotelsThe hotel industry last week asked the White House for a $150 billion financial-aid package targeted specifically for hospitality companies. What it got instead from the stimulus bill is a patchwork of loans grants and tax help much of it through the $350 billion in loans and grants for small businesses. The majority of U.S. hoteliers qualify as businesses with fewer than 500 employees making less than $35 million in annual revenue.The lodging industry even scored a victory in getting language in the Senate bill that defined each individual hotel as its own business. Hotel owners with several properties had been concerned that they would not qualify as a small business because taken together all their properties would have pushed them over the current Small Business Administration’s definition.The federal boost in unemployment insurance will help the many hotel employees who have been furloughed across the U.S. Larger hotel companies can apply for loans through the Treasury Department’s economic stabilization fund. But few in the lodging industry expect travel to bounce back by late spring or even soon after. —Craig KarminMovie theatersFor larger movie theaters many of which are expected to stay closed as long as government guidance limits the number of people who can gather in one place the stimulus bill’s loan guarantee fund could help pay leases or mortgages that are still due for the closed operations or pay suppliers with bills for everything from popcorn to custodial supplies said Patrick Corcoran spokesman for the National Association of Theatre Owners trade group.Small and midsize chains are more likely to take advantage of the bill’s provisions for small businesses especially those looking to compensate workers not collecting a paycheck with the theater closed. A majority of the sector’s 150000 workers in the U.S. are hourly wage employees Mr. Corcoran said. —Erich SchwartzelMusicThe music industry stands to benefit from the bill’s provisions that expand unemployment and small-business loans to independent contractors and sole proprietors. Now session musicians songwriters and gig workers at venues and on tours that were postponed or canceled will be eligible to apply for such benefits. Charitable organizations affiliated with the music business could also receive grants from the new funding for the National Endowment of the Arts.“This is a huge lifeline for musicians right now” said Mitch Glazier chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America a trade organization that lobbied on behalf of some 40 music industry companies. “For an independent contractor to get full unemployment benefits during a time of no work is the difference between them being able to stay a musician or not.” —Anne SteelePostal ServiceThe financially strained U.S. Postal Service is getting a $10 billion Treasury loan to help the mail carrier during the pandemic. That should be welcome news for Amazon.com Inc. United Parcel Service Inc. and to a lesser extent FedEx Corp. which rely on postal workers for last-mile delivery in certain places.The Postal Service is only allowed by law to raise its net debt by $3 billion a year so the bill loosens that restriction. But it does come with some strings attached. Mainly the Postal Service can only use the financing for operating expenses and not to pay down outstanding debt. The bill also requires the Postal Service to prioritize medical shipments and allows temporary delivery points to protect workers and recipients of mail. —Paul ZiobroPrivate-equity fundsPrivate-equity firms will likely find it a challenge to get access to stimulus funds. Based on available details of the stimulus package private-equity-owned businesses wouldn’t be explicitly barred from receiving assistance. But government lending requirements could prevent them from unlocking the aid say lawyers lobbyists and regulatory experts. In most cases “I don’t think they should be thinking of this federal money as a savior” said Howard Glazer a partner at Ropes & Gray LLP who advises private-equity firms. —Chris CummingRailroadsNational passenger railroad Amtrak secured about $1 billion to cover revenue losses related to the coronavirus. The railroad industry won enhanced unemployment benefits that account for its workers not being covered under traditional state-run unemployment programs. Railroad workers instead receive unemployment benefits under a program administered by the Railroad Retirement Board. The bill removes a seven-day waiting period to collect unemployment and provides $50 million to cover the benefits tied to that waiver. It also provides $425 million to double biweekly unemployment payments to $1200 through July. —Paul ZiobroRetailersRetailers hastened a correction that was already in the works to a drafting error in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that required them to expense property improvements over 39 years instead of in the first year as was initially intended. Because of the mistake retailers along with restaurants and hotels that made such improvements over the past two years overpaid their taxes by as much as $30 billion according to David French the National Retail Association’s senior vice president of government relations. The bill will allow that money to flow back to these companies. But the aid is far short of what designer Tory Burch and other retail CEOs had lobbied for including direct cash infusions so that they can continue to pay workers while stores are closed rent relief and the waiver of duties and tariffs. —Suzanne KapnerRestaurantsRestaurant owners were encouraged that a range of operations were set to be eligible for small-business loans. Previous versions of the loan provision had capped the employee head count at 500 smaller than many franchised operations trade groups said. Now most franchisees should qualify for the program they said.“It’s a pretty huge win for franchisees across the board” said Matthew Haller senior vice president for government relations at the International Franchise Association.Mitch Cohen owner of three Jersey Mike’s Subs shops in Suffolk County N.Y. said the stimulus could help keep his business afloat if it gets to business owners soon. “How fast are the funds going to come to the front lines that’s the next concern” said Mr. Cohen. Brandon Robertson a Kansas-based owner of nine KFC restaurant locations said his biggest hope is to get funding to keep all 140 of his employees. “We don’t want to have to start over” said Mr. Robertson a franchisee of the Yum Brands Inc. division. —Heather HaddonSmall businessesThe deal would allow businesses and nonprofits with up to 500 workers in a single location to apply through qualifying banks for loans backed by the Small Business Administration. The loans would convert into grants that don’t have to be repaid for amounts spent on items such as payroll rent or utilities with the grants reduced when workers are laid off. The loans would be capped at $10 million and cover wages up to $100000 a year. —Siobhan HughesTechTech companies didn’t see much direct assistance from the proposed funding bill though hosts for home-sharing giant Airbnb Inc. would be eligible for small business loans and unemployment insurance. Drivers and food-delivery workers for companies such as Uber Technologies Inc. and DoorDash Inc. though considered independent contractors qualify for unemployment benefits under the proposed legislation. Some tech firms even fear being left out. The draft legislation around loan guarantees for small- and medium-size businesses could cut out small technology companies and other startups funded by venture capital partnerships.Equipment makers though not a direct beneficiary of handouts still cheered the funding package particularly for helping to keep their struggling customers afloat and supporting small and medium-size businesses. Todd Thibodeaux president and CEO of CompTIA the Computing Technology Industry Association said it was vital for the industry since much of the IT sector is made up of companies with fewer than 100 employees. —Preetika RanaPERSONAL FINANCE AND TAXESBankruptcyThe law ensures that people who file for bankruptcy don’t have to use stimulus checks to repay past debt and it extends the time that bankrupt people have to repay a portion of their debt as a condition to getting a fresh start. The current repayment time limit is five years; the bill extends the repayment time frame to seven years. —Katy Stech FerekCredit reportingConsumers who fall behind on their debt payments won’t necessarily take a hit on their credit reports. The bill requires lenders that allow struggling consumers to defer or skip loan payments to report the borrowers as current on their payments even if they are not. Most consumers who were behind on their debts before the coronavirus crisis will continue to be reported as delinquent. —AnnaMaria AndriotisMortgagesThe bill requires companies that service federally backed mortgages to grant a forbearance of up to 360 days to borrowers who say they have been harmed by the coronavirus outbreak. ervicers are prohibited from initiatiSng foreclosure and processing foreclosure-related evictions for 60 days beginning March 18. Owners of multifamily properties can request a forbearance of up to 90 days during which tenants cannot be evicted for nonpayment of rent or other fees —Orla McCaffreyRetirementThe law temporarily loosens the rules on hardship distributions from retirement accounts giving people affected by the crisis access to up to $100000 of their retirement savings without a 10% penalty. The law doubles the amount 401(k) participants can take in loans from an account for the next six months to the lower of $100000 or 100% of the account balance. (IRAs don’t permit loans.) For retirees the law suspends for 2020 the mandatory distributions the government requires most to take from tax-deferred 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts starting at either age 70½ or age 72. —Anne TergesenStudent loansThe law would allow most Americans with federal student loans to suspend their monthly payments through Sept. 30 2020 without any interest accruing. It would also enable employers to make tax-exempt contributions toward their workers’ student-loan payments. —Josh MitchellTaxesPeople who don’t itemize their deductions would be able to claim up to $300 for charitable contributions. Businesses get the ability to apply losses from 2018 2019 or 2020 to past years’ profits and claim refunds. Restaurants and retailers would benefit from the fixing of a mistake in the 2017 tax law that curbed their depreciation deductions on renovations.Employers would be able to defer paying their share of 2020 payroll taxes. They could then make half of those payments in 2021 and the other half in 2022. In addition the bill creates a new tax credit for retaining employees that’s aimed at companies that are too large to benefit from the small-business assistance elsewhere in the bill. Those employers would be able to get a tax credit equal to 50% of payroll. That is limited to $10000 per employee per quarter and for employers with more than 100 employees it is available only to those companies and nonprofits that had their businesses limited or closed by government actions. —Richard Rubin

The number of patients plummeted.Now the clinic located in the California county with the most deaths from the new coronavirus can’t persuade their immigrant patients who call in with cold symptoms to get examined.“We get patients who call and say I’m a bit sick but I’d rather stay home than come in” said Ranjani Chandramouli the clinic’s medical director. “They’re afraid.”Public-health officials say a Trump administration policy meant to discourage immigrants from using public-health resources is deterring people from getting medical treatment for fear of hurting their immigration status making it harder to test and treat possible cases of the new coronavirus.Anita Monoian chief executive of Yakima Neighborhood Health Services a network of clinics in Yakima County Wash. one of the states at the center of the outbreak said she fears warnings about that policy could overshadow what her patients are now hearing about the virus.“If you’re fearful you’re not likely to come in for something you think is a routine sore throat or cough” Ms. Monoian said. “Why would you risk it?”The administration policy known as the public-charge rule makes it tougher for immigrants to become permanent residents if they have used forms of public assistance including Medicaid. The administration has said the policy is necessary to prevent immigrants from becoming dependent on the government and more recently has framed it as a safeguard to ensure American hospitals aren’t overwhelmed with uninsured patients as they respond to Covid-19 the illness caused by the coronavirus.The rule is “critical to defending and protecting Americans’ health and its health-care resources” read a recent bulletin from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services the Department of Homeland Security agency that handles green-card applications.The policy isn’t designed to affect most of the nation’s 11 million unauthorized immigrants who aren’t eligible to enroll in most benefits—programs like Medicaid only become available five years after an immigrant has become a permanent resident—and in any case have no pathway to apply for legal status.But in its own analysis of the policy’s impact the government predicted that concern and misinformation around the new policy could prompt many immigrants including legal residents to disenroll themselves or their U.S. citizen children from health benefits fearing they would bring themselves unwanted attention from immigration authorities.In a proposed version of the rule published in 2018 DHS listed widespread withdrawal from public benefits as one of the rule’s primary economic benefits. The agency predicted the policy would save the government some $2.3 billion a year with at least 324000 people withdrawing from benefit programs. Almost none of those people it said would be directly subject to the rule but they were likely to change their behavior nonetheless.DHS also listed potential consequences of the policy’s chilling effects in the final published version of the rule including “increased prevalence of communicable diseases including among members of the U.S. citizen population.”“When the Trump administration pushed the public-charge rule it did so knowing that immigrants would be discouraged from getting care“ said Andy Slavitt who headed the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services during the Obama administration. ”A public-health crisis reveals how unwise this is.”Medical and public-health officials attempting to trace the spread of the disease are concerned cases will remain invisible to them should immigrants decide not to seek care for symptoms they don’t believe are life-threatening.“We are worried some people might not be seeking care until they really crash and then it might be too late” said Matthew Kusher clinical director at Plaza del Sol family health center in Queens N.Y. which treats primarily Latino and Asian immigrants. The center he said is getting pummeled with coronavirus cases each day.Dr. Kusher said his staff has attempted to explain to patients and their communities that coming to the center which receives funding from the federal government won’t place them in danger. But “people are wary. They believe they are having their names placed in a registry” he said.U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement last week appeared to ease its hard line saying it wouldn’t target nonviolent immigrants for the duration of the coronavirus crisis. The government also encouraged immigrants to seek treatment saying in a bulletin that medical treatment or preventive services wouldn’t now be considered in an immigrant’s green card application—if the applicant noted it.President Trump said at the White House coronavirus briefing Sunday that he wanted anyone regardless of immigration status to be tested without fear of consequences. “Yes we will test that person because I think it’s important that we test that person” he said.But Ken Cuccinelli a top Homeland Security official said on Twitter last week that ICE would continue to prioritize arresting and removing criminals and others who pose a threat just as it always has. “That does not mean that no other removable aliens will in fact be removed but during the current public health situation removals will be done in such a way as to minimize the exposure of our agents and of the removable aliens we are encountering” he wrote.Public-health officials said the government’s assurances came too late to reverse the deterrent effect of its earlier hard-line statements.“The patients we serve aren’t news junkies like the rest of us are” said Ms. Monoian. “When we’re talking to them and they have a sore throat or a cough the fear factor of public charge is going to slow them down from coming in.”
78,Record Rise in Unemployment Claims Halts Historic Run of Job Growth,Eric Morath Jon Hilsenrath and Sarah Chaney,The Wall Street Journal,0,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-long-run-of-american-job-growth-has-ended-11585215000,WASHINGTON—A record 3.28 million workers applied for unemployment benefits last week as the new coronavirus hit the U.S. economy marking an abrupt end to the nation’s historic decadelong run of job growth.The number of Americans filing for claims was nearly five times the previous record high. The surge was for the week ended March 21 and could rise further. Pennsylvania Ohio and California were among 10 states reporting more than 100000 claims leaving unemployment systems overloaded.Millions of U.S. businesses have announced layoffs or furloughs as their cash flows dry up. Several state and local authorities have ordered nonessential businesses to close in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic bringing the great American job machine to a sudden halt.Until March U.S. employers added jobs for a record 113 straight months causing payrolls to grow by 22 million. In the process millions of people—including low-wage hourly laborers disabled people minorities former inmates and others—found work. The unemployment rate which was 3.5% in February had been at levels not seen since the 1960s. Wages started to accelerate in the last two years after lagging during the early stages of the expansion that followed the 2007-09 recession.The strong labor market kept the U.S. economy humming for a decade—straight through a European debt crisis Japan’s tsunami a Chinese economic slowdown a domestic manufacturing slump volatile energy prices and a global trade war.And then in a matter of days it stopped.Millions of Americans already fearful the new coronavirus could infect them or their families now have two new worries: When will the job machine start again? And can they hold out until it does? Much will depend on how long the virus crisis lasts and whether federal and state unemployment insurance programs can adapt quickly to fill the immense gaps building in household cash flows until the virus recedes.“We haven’t seen this big of a free fall before” said Keith Hall former director of the Congressional Budget Office and adviser to President George W. Bush. “Not even during the Depression…It’s really like an instant Great Recession.”Mr. Hall said the jobless rate in the coming months could approach the 20% that some economists estimate occurred during the Depression. Northern Trust Chief Economist Carl Tannenbaum said if half the workers in hard-hit industries such as restaurants retail and personal services are laid off the unemployment rate could rise 10 percentage points to more than 13%. That is well above the post-World War II record high of 10.8% at the end of the 1981-82 recession.The number of jobless claims filed last week in Pennsylvania increased by 363469 to 378908 with 5.8% of the labor force seeking assistance.Those figures didn’t capture everyone seeking assistance. Denzel Buie said he was stymied by crashing websites and unending phone-call waits when attempting to file a claim. The 25-year-old was laid off from his union construction job on March 20 when local authorities shut down projects including the welding and wall building he was doing at Swarthmore College in Pennsylvania. At the start of last week the state ordered restaurants and bars to shut down.The increase in claims last week was 17 times higher than the previous record one-week jump. In recessions claims gradually rise allowing states to shift resources. Now more claims were filed last week than for all of April 2009 the peak month for job loss during the 2007-09 recession.Mr. Buie said his layoff was a serious blow to his family which includes a 3-year-old daughter. His wife a secretary was laid off a week earlier when the allergist’s office where she worked suspended operations.“It’s not like I can go get another job” Mr. Buie said. “It was a massive layoff—the entire construction industry in Philadelphia shut down. All I can do is stay home and pray I don’t get sick because if I go to the hospital that’s another bill.”Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine mandated bars and restaurants to close dine-in services on March 15. The state had 187784 new jobless claims last week.Pennsylvania and Ohio provided an estimated number of claims the only two states to do so according to the Labor Department. A department analyst said the estimates were likely due to the high-volume of claims received.Job losses swept across the nation hitting states with varying mandates for social distancing. California with tough restrictions had 186809; Texas with less had 155657; while New Jersey had 155454.In Rhode Island 6.4% of the labor force—nearly 1 in 15 workers—sought benefits the highest share in the country. The state’s governor announced that effective Tuesday March 17 there would be “no on-premise food consumption” at restaurants bars and coffee shops.In Nevada nearly 6% filed claims. The initial wave of layoffs hit the hospitality restaurant and tourism industries—the lifeblood of Las Vegas—hardest. Casinos closed March 17.The claims data likely don’t fully capture the severity of the layoffs. Workers aren’t required to file for claims the week they are let go. If a person is ill or busy caring for children or family members they may put off filing for benefits especially if the process requires a lengthy wait. New York state one of the areas hardest hit had a relatively small level of claims for its population less than 1% of its labor force.In addition more companies laid off workers this week as additional states ordered nonessential businesses to close.Economists are divided on whether the downturn is short-term disruption or the start of a prolonged recession.If the nation can get back to business quickly restaurants airlines hotels and others might quickly hire back the workers they have let go or furloughed in the shock. With support from government-support programs including the $2 trillion rescue program being considered in Congress the jobless rate could theoretically surge and then recede. That is what happened in the 1980s unlike the long periods of high unemployment in the 1930s and after the 2007-09 financial crisis.But there are other scenarios. If infection and death rates associated with the coronavirus grow untamed social distancing—steps to stem the spread of the virus such as keeping 6 feet apart avoiding nonessential travel and gatherings of more than 10 people—could prolong the economic pain. Even if the federal government moves away from its push for social distancing—as President Trump has suggested he is considering—states cities businesses and individuals could still decide they have no other choice.The cash crunch now hitting businesses and households also could induce them to pull back further starting a downward cycle that feeds on itself. All of that could dent business and household confidence leaving long-lasting economic scars.Getting back to work thus hangs on how quickly the virus itself is tamed.“This is happening with dizzying speed and therein lies my concern” Northern Trust’s Mr. Tannenbaum said. “The shock and awe from the forthcoming employment numbers could be damaging to the nation’s psyche.”Large corporations were initially reluctant to lay off workers aggressively in part because they expected the virus to pass quickly and didn’t want to part with employees. Finding and keeping good workers in what was a tight labor market had been hard.Now pressures to fire people are building beyond the industries most directly exposed. General Electric Co. ’s jet-engine business said Monday it would lay off about 10% of its U.S. workforce or about 2500 employees. Medical offices not tied to treating the virus including dentists and physical therapists are shutting and letting workers go. Those providing in-person services—such as barbers massage therapists and housecleaners—are seeing business evaporate.The job market isn’t uniformly dark in part because the repercussions of the crisis are spreading unevenly. Walmart Inc. Amazon.com Inc. and CVS Health Corp. are among about a dozen large companies that have said they are seeking to hire nearly 500000 workers in coming weeks. The companies are managing a surge in demand for food and other household products that have taxed their stores and warehouses.“We are hiring” says Jeff Stevenson who runs a wine marketing business that focuses on remote sales called VinoPRO Inc. “We literally had our single largest sales day of the year last Wednesday.”Though those mini-booms are encouraging economists don’t expect them to fully counter the pressures millions of other employers face to lay off workers as sales and cash flows dry up.Joe Olivo is president of Perfect Communications a small New Jersey commercial printing company that produces direct mailings for universities and nonprofits and promotional material for retail businesses. In February business was booming. Revenue was up 28% from a year earlier and he was looking to add five more people to his payroll. Under pressure to retain workers and respond to rising minimum wages in the state he pushed up pay between 2.5% and 11% for his workforce in 2019.Then in a matter of days orders dropped 70%. He thought he would draw in $10 million in revenue this year; now he sees around $5.8 million much of it already made. That won’t be enough to cover his costs. He has already let five part-time workers go and cut shifts to about 30 hours a week for the other 50. He told his banks he won’t be able to make payments this month.“Right now the lenders are saying ‘We get it’” he said. But without cash flow difficult decisions loom about whether to let more people go. “I am working hard not to do that.”Jacqueline Martin a massage therapist based in Albuquerque N.M. typically gives up to 16 massages a week charging at least $50 for a one-hour session. She hasn’t worked much this month and isn’t eligible for unemployment insurance under existing programs.“Massage is touch and that’s how this is spreading” Ms. Martin said. “I can’t Skype my massages.”Among many other measures Congress is considering expanding coverage to include self-employed people like Ms. Martin.Mr. Hall the former CBO director is among the economists who expect the economy to recover at a slower pace than it contracts. But he pointed to a reason for hope: The labor market has defied expectations in the recent past drawing a larger share of Americans into the workforce than many expected and reaching low unemployment levels few thought possible.“We kept getting fooled” he said. “We kept thinking the labor market couldn’t keep improving but it did. Let’s hope that the surge in labor-force participation is a permanent one and once we get through this those people will be back to work.”
79,Hospital Capacity Crosses Tipping Point in U.S. Coronavirus Hot Spots,Melanie Evans and Stephanie Armour,The Wall Street Journal,0,https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospital-capacity-crosses-tipping-point-in-u-s-coronavirus-hot-spots-11585215006,Hospitals in U.S. pandemic epicenters have passed a tipping point in the fight against the new coronavirus as the relentless climb in infections forces some to move patients to outlying facilities divert ambulances and store bodies in a refrigerated truck.New York home to the nation’s largest outbreak of Covid-19 the illness caused by the new coronavirus is rushing to build a temporary hospital in a Manhattan conference center in the hope of staying ahead of the fast-spreading disease.Hospitals in parts of New York City have become so full of critically ill patients that they have steered ambulances elsewhere. The full-to-capacity morgue at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens is using a refrigerated truck to hold some of the dead. Thirteen people died in the hospital in the last 24 hours said NYC Health + Hospitals which operates Elmhurst.New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that hospitalization rates are showing signs of slowing but he cited a continued rise in the rate of infection.In the Seattle area where the West Coast’s largest outbreak has claimed 94 lives according to Johns Hopkins University data hospitals are transferring patients to where beds are available.“We’re not completely drowning although it feels like that at times” said John Milne who oversees the hunt for space for Renton Wash.-based Providence St. Joseph Health and said the company’s Swedish Issaquah Campus hospital has run out of beds for incoming Covid-19 patients. “We’re on the threshold of being overwhelmed.”Efforts to cope in two metro areas that have seen rapid increases in people stricken with Covid-19 realize concerns of health officials that the pandemic will overtake hospital space and supplies of essential equipment.Doctors in the two hot spots say their experiences are a warning for other cities and hospitals that may soon be grappling with greater numbers of infections.“They have time” Brendan Carr chairman of emergency medicine for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York said of communities where the number of infections isn’t as high as in some U.S. cities. “They have the privilege of knowing.”More federal aid for hospitals is expected but those in slammed cities said time is running short.In New York and the Seattle area hospitals with available beds are taking patients from those without space or the level of care needed for patients. Public and hospital officials are tracking capacity to prepare for rapid overflows.“Things are moving very quickly” said James Lawler executive director of the Global Center for Health Security at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and an infectious-disease expert. Cases of new coronavirus can double within days reports elsewhere in the world show he said.In New York Mr. Cuomo said during a press briefing Wednesday that data suggest the spread of the disease is slowing in his state. “The evidence suggests that the density-control measures may be working” Mr. Cuomo said. On Sunday the number of people hospitalized for Covid-19 was projected to double every two days. As of Tuesday it was projected to double every 4.7 days. Mr. Cuomo said the trend could change but he called it a positive sign.Nearly 31000 New Yorkers have tested positive for the virus state officials said at the briefing and 3805 were hospitalized. Of those 888 are in intensive care units; 285 New Yorkers have died. New York accounts for more than half the infections in the country.Confirmed cases in the city totaled about 15600 as of Wednesday Johns Hopkins University data show dwarfing numbers elsewhere in the country. That is partly because New York has succeeded in rapidly expanding its testing while other states struggle to do so.New York’s density is also a factor in the spread of the illness. A physician at Bellevue Hospital in the borough of Manhattan described the risk in crowded city households as palpable as she called to update the family of a patient. “I call her family and they are a big family that all lives in a small apartment” the doctor said. “Another family member has symptoms. Another family member is pregnant. Is there any way to get distance in the house? Of course not…. You get this sinking feeling that they don’t stand a chance.”The surge in cases has overwhelmed Elmhurst Hospital where the Federal Emergency Management Agency arrived with supplies Tuesday. Doctors at Elmhurst have relied on ventilators donated from another hospital and less-powerful breathing machines to treat patients who arrive gasping for air said Colleen Smith an emergency room doctor there.Mitchell Katz chief executive officer of the NYC Health + Hospitals system said Elmhurst Hospital has been hit hardest but it has enough ventilators. “Every night I check” he said. “How many ventilators do we have?” He has restocked the hospital’s supply four times he said.Elmhurst has redirected ambulances as it became inundated with people who were struggling to breathe Dr. Katz said. “It was safer for patients in ambulances to be diverted to a hospital less overwhelmed.”The hospital needed a refrigerated truck for bodies as deaths outstripped its small morgue Dr. Katz said. Families that unexpectedly lose loved ones need time to make arrangements. “In this kind of crisis everyone can’t immediately come to collect the body” Dr. Katz said.Cities and states slammed by escalating numbers of cases are sprinting to open more hospitals buying and reopening bankrupt or old facilities for bed space setting up emergency medical tents and pleading for beds from the federal government.Mr. Cuomo has revised New York’s projected statewide need for hospital beds upward to 140000 including 40000 for intensive-care patients. “Those are troubling and astronomical numbers” he said.The governor has mandated that hospitals increase capacity by at least 50% and said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has identified four sites to convert to temporary hospitals. The Army Corps of Engineers didn’t respond to a request for comment.“It’s likely all major hospitals are going to become ICU hospitals” said Dr. Katz and newly created beds will be used for people who need less intense care or a place to recover.New beds will need doctors and nurses when hospitals are straining to boost their workforces.In a letter to health-care workers this week New York’s Health Commissioner said the state would welcome retirees and those with expired licenses. “New York State will recertify these individuals for immediate deployment” according a copy of the letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.Doctors at NYU Langone Health which operates New York area hospitals received a mandatory survey by email last week asking them to describe their medical specialties the hospitals at which they work and other training they could put to use said a person who received the survey. The first 15 volunteers began filling in at NYU Langone’s hospitals this week.Expansion consumes valuable time: hospitals must retrofit ventilation in rooms to prevent contagion and train staff who don’t typically care for the most-critical patients said doctors and hospital executives.New York’s Mount Sinai Morningside Hospital began two weeks ago to expand its intensive-care capacity and is expected to double those beds within six weeks said John Puskas the hospital’s chairman of cardiovascular surgery. The early start allowed the hospital to convert more space before existing capacity fills. “That’s why we’re not underwater just now” he said.In Washington roughly 1000 hospital beds sent to the state by the U.S. Defense Department are ready to be deployed said Karina Shagren a spokeswoman for the Washington Military Department.Providence’s Swedish hospital system initially sent Covid-19 patients to a suburban hospital which filled up said Mr. Milne. Intensive-care units across its five Seattle-area hospitals are largely full and Swedish is sending patients across town to UW Medicine Hospital in a countywide effort to manage the influx of patients he said.Swedish is preparing to send its least critical patients to a hotel where nurses will care for them. UW Medicine still has capacity a spokeswoman said.California is moving to open as many as four temporary hospitals and is seeking to lease St. Vincent Medical Center the oldest hospital in Los Angeles and Seton Medical Center in Daly City outside San Francisco from Verity Health System of California Inc. which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2018. Verity said in January that it would close St. Vincent.“It’s an immediate escape valve for us” said Carmela Coyle chief executive of the California Hospital Association. California’s governor said last week that one model projected demand for as many as 19000 more beds as the virus spreads there.Florida has dispatched emergency teams to reopen a closed facility readied four field hospitals and has asked federal officials for five mobile intensive care units and another 5000 hospital beds Florida health-care and emergency-management officials said. The state is also moving to ramp up efforts to open new facilities that were already close to opening their doors said Mary Mayhew Florida’s secretary for the Agency for Health Care Administration.
80,Five More U.S. Sailors at Sea Tested Positive for Coronavirus,Nancy A. Youssef,The Wall Street Journal,0,https://www.wsj.com/articles/five-more-u-s-sailors-with-coronavirus-airlifted-at-sea-11585168155,Five more sailors aboard a U.S. aircraft carrier at sea have tested positive for the new coronavirus Navy officials said more than doubling the number of cases on the ship in the past day.Four of the eight stricken sailors now have been airlifted from the USS Theodore Roosevelt which is operating in the Pacific to a military medical facility in Guam the officials said. Four others soon would be evacuated the officials said.The Navy also said it also is working to identify other crew members with whom the infected sailors had close contact the officials said.t is “all towards the goal of minimizing any additional transmission” Adm. John Aquilino commander of the Pacific Fleet said in an interview.The sailors aboard the Roosevelt were the first to test positive for coronavirus while on board a deployed military ship which is carrying roughly 5000 service members.On Tuesday the Pentagon said that three of the ship’s sailors had tested positive for the coronavirus. Adm. Michael Gilday chief of naval operations said Tuesday that the aircraft carrier would continue its operations.The sailors on the ship visited Da Nang Vietnam more than two weeks ago during a port visit and may have contracted the virus there Navy officials said. Acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said the sailors also could have contracted the virus from another source such as flight crew members from a plane that visited the aircraft carrier.Among those who met the Roosevelt as it arrived in Vietnam earlier this month was Adm. Aquilino.Adm. Aquilino said that neither he nor members of his staff who accompanied him have exhibited any symptoms and because of that he hasn’t gotten tested in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on coronavirus testing. The guidelines recommend that only those with symptoms like a fever breathing difficulty or a cough should be tested.“I feel 100% fine” Adm. Aquilino said adding he was seeking no special testing consideration. “My health is no different than anyone else’s.”The rapid spread of the virus on the ship highlights the challenge facing the military as it tries to continue conducting operations while combating coronavirus. At a Pentagon briefing Wednesday Air Force Brig. Gen. Paul Friedrichs the Joint Staff surgeon called it a balancing act.Since Friday the number of service members who have tested positive for coronavirus has tripled from 76 to 227 according to Pentagon figures.“Our curve is not flattening” Gen. Friedrichs acknowledged Wednesday.The Pentagon hasn’t issued departmentwide standards on when the military should hold meetings or suspend or curtail exercises formations and training allowing commanders to make such determinations.
81,Who would get what and when from the $2 trillion relief package,Mariam Khan,ABC,-1,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trillion-stimulus-package/story?id=69791823,The White House and Senate negotiators struck a deal early Wednesday morning on a massive $2 trillion package that will provide essential relief to an economy struggling amid the coronavirus crisis.The $2 trillion relief package is the biggest in American history.The Senate approved the bill late Wednesday. The House needs to pass the bill before it can reach President Donald Trump’s desk.Full details of the package have yet to be released but some elements of the proposal are being touted among Republican and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill.Here are the key takeaways on who would get what and when:Direct payments for most Americans taxpayersUnder the plan individuals who earn $75000 or less in adjusted gross income would get direct payments of $1200 each with married couples earning up to $150000 receiving $2400.An additional $500 per child will be tacked on to that.The payment would scale down as income rises phasing out entirely at $99000 for singles and $198000 for couples without children.Ninety percent of Americans would be eligible to receive full or partial payments according to estimates by the Tax Policy Center.It’s unclear how long it will take the Internal Revenue Service to process and calculate each and every payment. The White House has indicated that Americans could be seeing direct payments as soon as April 6.Expanded unemployment insuranceLawmakers agreed to a significant expansion of unemployment benefits that would expand unemployment insurance by 13 weeks and include a four-month enhancement of benefits -- an additional $600 per week - on top of what state unemployment programs pay.In total unemployed workers are eligible to receive up to 39 weeks of unemployment benefits.The program was expanded to include freelancers furloughed employees and gig workers such as Uber drivers.The massive boost in unemployment insurance is expected to cost $250 billion.Small business to receive emergency loansThe legislation creates a $367 billion federally-guaranteed loan program for small businesses who must pledge not to lay off their workers.The loans would be available during an emergency period ending at the of June and would be forgiven if the employer pays its workers for the duration of the crisis.According to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's office the deal also includes $10 billion in Small Business Administration emergency grants and up to $10 million of emergency relief per business. It allocates $17 billion for the SBA to cover six months of payment for small businesses with existing SBA loans.It will offer $30 billion in emergency education funding and $25 billion in emergency transit funding.Big companies get cashThe plan includes loans for distressed companies from a $425 billion fund controlled by the Federal Reserve. An additional $75 billion would be available for industry-specific loans including to airlines and hotels.This was a major sticking point for Democrats: they successfully pushed for oversight including the installment of an inspector general and a congressionally appointed board to monitor the fund.The plan also calls for an immediate disclosure of the fund recipients.The stimulus bill also includes a provision that forbids President Trump and his family as well as other top government officials and members of Congress from getting loans or investments from Treasury programs in the stimulus according to Schumer's office.As part of the deal airlines will be prohibited from stock buybacks and CEO bonuses Schumer wrote in a letter Wednesday to Democratic senators.Hospitals drowning under crisis to receive aidThe massive package also includes $100 billion in assistance for hospitals and health systems across the nation.Schumer said the plan offers “billions more” for critical investments into personal and protective equipment for health care workers testing supplies increased workforce and training among other things.Lawmakers also agreed to increase Medicare payment increases to all hospitals and providers Schumer said.
82,FBI learned of coronavirus-inspired bomb plotter through radicalized US Army soldier,Mike Levine,ABC,-1,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/fbi-learned-coronavirus-inspired-bomb-plotter-radicalized-us/story?id=69818116,The suspected white supremacist who plotted to bomb a hospital facing the coronavirus crisis was in touch with a then-active U.S. Army soldier who wanted to launch his own attack on a major American news network and discussed targeting a Democratic presidential candidate according to an FBI alert summarizing the case.On Tuesday as 36-year-old Timothy Wilson was on the verge of trying to detonate a car bomb at a Kansas City-area medical center agents from the FBI’s field office in Missouri attempted to arrest him. But shots were fired fatally wounding Wilson according to the FBI.Ahead of Tuesday’s incident Wilson “espoused white supremacist ideology” and “made a threat that if any agent attempted to [search his property] they should ‘bring a lot of body bags” said the FBI alert distributed to state and local law enforcement agencies in the region on Wednesday.The FBI alert also said Wilson had “shared instructions on how to make an [improvised explosive device] with another ... Domestic Terrorism (DT) subject” from near Kansas City.ABC News has identified that other domestic terrorism “subject” as Jarrett Smith who was arrested in September 2019 while still stationed at Ft. Riley Kansas as an active member of the U.S. Army.According to charging documents filed at the time in Topeka Kansas Smith allegedly planned to travel to Ukraine to fight with the violent far-right group Azov Battalion; suggested targeting then-Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke; proposed bombing the headquarters of a still-unidentified news network; and distributed bomb-making tips online.Smith has since pleaded guilty to federal charges of distributing information that relates to weapons of mass destruction and he is awaiting sentencing.On Wednesday sources familiar with the matter told ABC News that Wilson had been on the FBI’s radar for more than a year indicating that the FBI’s probe of Smith led authorities to Wilson months before he sought to take advantage of the unfolding coronavirus crisis.“With the current COVID-19 pandemic Wilson decided to accelerate his plan to detonate a [car bomb] to cause severe harm and mass casualties” the FBI said in its alert. “Wilson may have also believed the additional stress on society posed by the COVID-19 pandemic provided unique opportunities to exploit.”The FBI believes other extremists inside the U.S. homeland may similarly “aspire to capitalize on the current health crisis” but it is “unlikely” any of their actions “will rise to the level of terroristic actions like Wilson” the alert issued Wednesday said.During a conference call with police chiefs from across the nation on Friday the Department of Homeland Security’s assistant secretary for Infrastructure Protection Brian Harrell and the department’s liaison to state and local law enforcement John Hill tried to assure the chiefs that the federal government is doing all it can to protect “critical infrastructure” in their cities and towns including hospitals.But even before coronavirus became a crisis inside America Harrell offered this stark assessment: “Based off of current events and the frequency of events I am convinced that this country is becoming more and more violent every single day.”“I live my life as if the worst day is right around the corner” he told Congress last month adding that the U.S. government is “focused on preparedness and protection.”

""On Friday the House will take up the legislation with strong bipartisan support.”Due to the limited flight options members participating in self-quarantine and several states mandating stay-at-home orders congressional leaders announced that the House will vote to approve the bill by voice vote - without the need for all members to return to the Capitol to participate in a recorded roll call vote.""In order to protect the safety of Members and staff and prevent further spread of COVID-19 through Members’ travel the Republican Leader and I expect that the House vote on final passage will be done by voice vote"" House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer D-Md. announced Wednesday night. ""Members who want to come to the House Floor to debate this bill will be able to do so. In addition we are working to ensure that those who are unable to return to Washington may express their views on this legislation remotely.""McConnell announced the Senate will not meet again for legislative business until April 20. The upper chamber will still meet every few days for pro forma sessions where additional measures may be considered amid the ongoing crisis. Once the bill clear the House the lower chamber is also expected to take a long recess while the country recovers from the pandemic.Senate Republicans downplayed concessions given to Democrats throughout the marathon negotiations arguing Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ""delayed life-saving aid to medical professionals and significant relief for families and small businesses in order to claim credit for wins that are either bipartisan or Republican ideas.""""Reading Chuck Schumer's list we half expected that the next thing I read would be the minority leader taking credit for inventing fire"" a senior Senate GOP aide said. ""The reality is that almost every significant ""win"" he's taking credit for is actually a Senate Republican idea.""The aide claimed Senate Republicans ""never objected"" that oversight of the Economic Stabilization Fund be structured in the mold of Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) oversight or that the bill would include billions of dollars to shore up hospitals.""What Schumer and Senate Democrats actually wanted was to create a completely new structure that would have given subpoena power to a new panel that would have had oversight of the entire Trump administration pandemic response"" the aide argued. ""From the beginning when Leader McConnell laid out four pillars of phase three unprecedented aid to the nation's hospitals was a primary element. There was always going to be tens and tens of billions for our hospitals in the CARES Act. Sen. Schumer's attempt to take credit for an increase in hospital aid is nonsensical because there was no opposition.""Wednesday afternoon a quartet of Senate Republicans objected to a provision in the massive unemployment insurance expansion in the package that they say could mean that some Americans could be paid more to be out of work than they were earning before they were laid off or furloughed because of the pandemic.In the unprecedented expansion of jobless benefits in the relief bill each worker would receive a $600 weekly check for four months -- on top of the customary benefits doled out by states.Sen. Lindsey Graham R-S.C. who pushed for the expansion of these benefits said he and three other GOP senators -- Rick Scott of Florida Tim Scott of South Carolina and Nebraska's Ben Sasse -- are demanding an amendment to the bill that would cap benefits for the jobless at 100 percent of a worker's pay before he or she was out of a job.""This bill pays you more not to work than if you were working"" Graham said contending the bill would pay the unemployed roughly $24 per hour on average.The provision which aides said was not a drafting error was negotiated by the Trump Administration Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and senior Democrats including Schumer and Ron Wyden the ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee.Unemployment insurance which is administered at the state level through individual programs was not conducive to imposing a brand new federal bureaucracy to dole out emergency benefits Republican and Democratic aides who were close to the talks explained. Senate negotiators chose to come up with a national average wage in order to arrive at the $600 weekly figure and the bill would have the states take on that financial burden on the front end only to be repaid by the federal government.Ultimately the problem was just a hiccup with the four introducing an amendment that would cap unemployment benefits but it failed in a vote late Wednesday.All politics are local and beyond exerting public pressure to lobby the Senate to improve the bill this is a package that most members of the House had little direct sway in crafting. That has generated apprehension that a single member -- Republican or Democrat -- could scuttle efforts to pass the Senate agreement without calling all of the House's membership back to Washington to cast a roll call vote.House Republican leaders held two conference calls with their members on Wednesday to build cohesive support for the Senate agreement. Minority Whip Steve Scalise is also touting the Senate deal as ""the largest economic relief package in American history.""Scalise's whip team convened a conference call Tuesday where a source expressed optimism that all lawmakers won't need to return for a vote -- and that they won't have to change the rules to achieve that.Whenever a vote is called in the House the member presiding over the House asks all in favor to say ""Aye!"" – and all opposed -- ""No!"" This generally provokes each side to yell out their votes and the member presiding over the House as Speaker Pro Tempore rules on whichever side he or she believes prevailed. Only then does a member - usually from the losing end - stand to request a recorded vote.The way GOP leaders see it their members could still shout ""NO!!!!!"" and be satisfied that they expressed their opposition without forcing a roll call vote. But it remains an open question whether all members would be content without a recorded vote.""It only takes one member to object to trying to pass this via [unanimous consent] which is a very real possibility that we recognize"" a whip team source acknowledged.

84,A third report a job loss half a pay cut as coronavirus crisis grips the economy,Gary Langer,ABC,-1,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/report-job-loss-half-pay-cut-coronavirus-crisis/story?id=69811808,Economic impacts of the coronavirus crisis are gripping the nation: One in three Americans in an ABC News/Washington Post poll say they or an immediate family member have been laid off or lost their job as a result of the pandemic and more – half – report a cut in pay or work hours.Beyond those stark realities worries for the future are profound. A nearly unanimous 92% expect a recession because of the outbreak with 59% calling this not just likely but very likely. If one occurs two-thirds think it will be as bad as the Great Recession or worse. Already in interviews Sunday through Wednesday 43% say the economic impacts on their own community are severe.See PDF for full results charts and tables.The survey’s result on job losses is reflected in the unprecedented level of new unemployment claims reported today by the federal government. But the claims data don’t reflect the broader public fears. Among those who haven’t yet experienced a job loss in their immediate family 58% are concerned about it occurring. And 53% are concerned their family will be hit with pay cuts or reduced work hours.The net totals mean that 71% of Americans either have had a layoff or job loss occur as a result of the pandemic or are concerned about this; and 76% either have lost pay or work hours or are concerned that this may happen.Further the survey finds higher levels of job losses and pay cuts among the most economically at-risk Americans: those with lower incomes racial and ethnic minorities and specifically in terms of job losses women who lack a four-year college degree.On another front the public expresses broad support for some elements of the economic stimulus package approved unanimously by the Senate last night. Eighty-six percent back cash payments to most Americans and 90% support billions in aid to small businesses with bipartisan views on both. Assistance for large corporations is far less popular with support dropping to 46%.Most interviews for this national survey were conducted Sunday and Monday in order to avoid potential call center shutdowns; the results are a portrait in time in the fast-moving crisis. While this report focuses on economic impacts further results tomorrow morning will look at personal impacts and other issues related to the pandemic. The survey was produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates.Who's hit?As noted economic impacts differ among groups. While 33% of Americans overall say they or someone in their immediate family has been laid off or lost a job as a result of the crisis it’s four in 10 among ethnic and racial minorities (including 41% of Hispanics and 39% among blacks) vs. 29% among whites.Similarly among those with household incomes less than $50000 39% report a layoff or job loss compared with 30% of those in the $50000-$100000 bracket and 21% of those with incomes of $100000 or more.The gender division also is significant with reports of job losses or layoffs higher among women than men 37 vs. 28%. That’s entirely due to the high level of job loss experiences among women who don’t have a college degree 41%.Reflecting these demographic differences the job loss number is lower among Republicans 25% than among independents or Democrats 35 and 34% respectively.There also are gaps among these groups – generally not as large – in who’s sustained a pay cut or a reduction in work hours. Here the big hit is among younger adults: Among those age 18-29 a broad 66% say they or someone in their immediate family has had their pay or work hours cut. It’s 59% among adults in their 30s and 47% among those age 40-64.Differences are especially profound moreover in terms of who’s worried about a job loss in their immediate family (excluding those who’ve already experienced it): Seventy-one percent of racial and ethnic minorities have this worry vs. 51% of whites; 63% of those with incomes less than $100000 vs. 43% of those with higher incomes; and 70% among Democrats vs. 44% among Republicans (with independents in the middle in terms of this worry 59%.) Results in concerns about a pay cut are generally similar.Further concern about job loss is higher in harder-hit states reaching 64% of those in states with 1000+ diagnosed cases as of Sunday (when interviewing began) declining to 47% among those in states with fewer than 200 cases at that time.Recession?Recession fears reflect local impacts. As noted 43% say the coronavirus already has had a severe economic impact on their community (including 16% who say it’s very severe). Those who report a severe economic impact are far more likely than others to see a recession as very likely (71 vs. 47%) and more than twice as likely to think it’ll be worse than the Great Recession (47 vs. 22%).Reports of severe economic impacts of the crisis peak in urban areas at 51% declining to 40% in the suburbs and 35% in rural areas. More people in the West reported severe economic impacts at the time of these interviews 51% vs. a low of 38% in the Midwest.There also are political and racial or ethnic divisions on local impacts. Nearly half of Democrats and independents alike report severe economic impacts in their communities vs. 32% of Republicans; and 51% of racial and ethnic minorities see severe impacts vs. 39% of whites.Beyond differing perceptions this could reflect a difference in the distribution of virus impacts – greater in urban areas as noted where more Democrats and minority group members reside – as well as greater economic vulnerability in those groups. Indeed 44% of Democrats live in one of the states with mandatory business closures at the start of these interviews compared with 33% of independents and 23% of Republicans.MethodologyThis ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone March 22-25 2020 in English and Spanish among a random national sample of 1003 adults. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points including the design effect. Partisan divisions are 30-24-37% Democrats-Republicans-independents.The survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates of New York N.Y. with sampling and data collection by Abt Associates of Rockville Md.

85,23 sailors on US Navy aircraft carrier test positive for coronavirus,Luis Martinez,ABC,-1,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/23-sailors-us-navy-aircraft-carrier-test-positive/story?id=69818040,"At least 23 sailors aboard the Navy aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt have become infected by the novel coronavirus according to two U.S. officials.The spike in the number of cases from three earlier this week is leading the Navy to order the ship to stop in Guam so all 5000 sailors aboard can be tested for exposure to the virus. It is a major cause of concern for defense officials as the tight quarters in aircraft carriers hold the potential for even more infections among the ship's crew.On Tuesday officials disclosed that there were three cases of COVID-19 aboard the ship marked the first time that infections had been detected aboard a U.S. Navy ship at sea.By Thursday the number of infected sailors shot up to 23 according to two U.S. officials.""As testing continues additional positive cases of COVID-19 have been discovered aboard USS Theodore Roosevelt"" Admiral Mike Gilday the chief of naval operations said in a statement. ""We are taking this threat very seriously and are working quickly to identify and isolate positive cases while preventing further spread of the virus aboard the ship.""He added ""No Sailors have been hospitalized or are seriously ill.""At an earlier Pentagon briefing on Thursday Thomas Modly the acting secretary of the Navy told reporters that the increase in infected sailors would lead to testing of the ship's entire crew.Modly said the aircraft carrier would remain pierside in the U.S. territory with the crew limited only to the ship's pier. A U.S. official told ABC News that the carrier is expected to arrive in Guam late Thursday.""Our medical team aboard USS Theodore Roosevelt is performing testing for the crew consistent with [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidelines and we are working to increase the rate of testing as much as possible' Gilday said in his statement.""Immediate priority will be symptomatic Sailors those in close contact with Sailors who have tested positive already and essential watch standers"" he continued. ""We are isolating those who test positive. Testing will continue as necessary to ensure the health of the entire ship's crew.""Modly had earlier described the symptoms of infected sailors aboard the carrier as being ""very mild"" -- namely body aches and sore throats.Gilday said he expected additional positive tests to emerge after the large scale testing of the ship's crew begins and that any sailors who test positive will be transported to U.S. Naval Hospital Guam for further examination. . ""We're taking this day by day"" he said. ""Our top two priorities are taking care of our people and maintaining mission readiness. Both of those go hand in glove.""Gilday added ""We are confident that our aggressive response will keep USS Theodore Roosevelt able to respond to any crisis in the region.""On Tuesday Gilday told reporters it was unclear if the sailors became infected with the coronavirus following the ship's most recent port of call in early March to Da Nang Vietnam."
86,Trump's push to open economy could come at cost of lives,AAMER MADHANI LAURIE KELLMAN and KEVIN FREKING ,ABC,-1,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trumps-push-open-economy-cost-lives-69805844,"WASHINGTON -- The contrast could hardly be more stark. Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York has said that if all of his sweeping expensive measures to stem the corornavirus saved one life it would be worth it. President Donald Trump has another view: The costs of shutting down the economy outweigh the benefits frequently telling Americans that 35000 people a year die from the common flu.Though it may seem crass the federal government actually has long made a calculation when imposing regulations called “the value of a statistical life” that places a price tag on a human life. It has been used to consider whether to require seat belts airbags or environmental regulations but has never been applied in a broad public health context.The question is now an urgent one given that Trump in recent days has latched on to the notion that the cure for the pandemic should not be worse than the disease and argued that “more people are going to die if we allow this to continue” if the economy remains closed. He has targeted a return a semblance of normalcy for the economy by Easter Sunday April 12.Critics say he’s presenting the nation with a false choice at a moment when deaths and infections from the virus are surging.“We’re not going to accept a premise that human life is disposable” said Cuomo whose state has seen far more infections and death from COVID-19 than any other state. “And we’re not going to put a dollar figure on human life.”For decades the federal government has made calculations on how policies intended to safeguard American health could impact the economy. Since the Reagan administration federal agencies have been required to perform analysis of any proposed regulations that are expected to have $100 million or more impact on the economy.The Environmental Protection Agency for example conducts cost-benefit analysis to estimate in dollar terms how much people are willing to pay for reductions in their risk of death from adverse health conditions caused by pollution. The Transportation Department estimates the additional cost that consumers would be willing to bear for improvements in safety at $9.6 million.Now the push-pull of when to re-open the economy during the coronavirus crisis centers on a similarly bleak question: What’s an economically acceptable death toll? Putting dollar figures on the value of life and health is inherently uncomfortable one expert said.“People hate that question” said Betsey Stevenson an economics and public policy professor at the University of Michigan who served on the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers during the Obama administration. ""By laying out the math in such a crude way people cringe when they see it.”Days into his own call for Americans to dedicate themselves for 15 days to social distancing including staying home from work and closing bars and restaurants to help try to stall the spread of the disease Trump has changed his tune.Trump has grumbled that “our country wasn’t built to be shut down” and vowed not to allow ""the cure be worse than the problem.”“The LameStream Media is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our Country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success” Trump tweeted Wednesday. “The real people want to get back to work ASAP. We will be stronger than ever before!”He also pushed back against suggestions that he is being cavalier about the prospect of more deaths being caused by a premature of reopening of the economy. “How many deaths are acceptable to me?” Trump told reporters Wednesday evening. “None.”But Democrats say that Trump was prioritizing the economy over the health and safety of Americans.""I’d like to say let’s get back to work next Friday” said former Vice President Joe Biden the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination. ”That’d be wonderful. But it can’t be arbitrary.”Trump certainly has his defenders. Fox News commentator Britt Hume has called it an “entirely reasonable viewpoint” that older Americans would be willing to sacrifice for the good of the economy and Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick has said he’s ""all in"" on lifting social distancing guidelines in order to help the economy.Mike Leavitt a Health and Human Services secretary in the George W. Bush administration said the battle against the virus is shaping into a “supremely local fight” and communities may need to periodically adjust as the crisis unfolds.“Each jurisdiction may not come to the same conclusion — because each jurisdiction may have different situations about shopping and businesses reopening” Leavitt said in an email.In the recent past the government has also put a dollar figure on American life in the aftermath of man-made calamities including the 9/11 attacks and the 2010 BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico which killed 11 and devastated the regional economy to compensate victims.Kenneth Feinberg who administered the victims’ funds stemming from those events said the formula used in the nation’s courts was a simple one: What would the victim have earned over the course of their life at work but for the tragedy that took their life? On top of that there was some added compensation for pain and suffering and emotional distress he said.“It is a rather straightforward calculation” Feinberg said.But when it comes to the current pandemic Feinberg said calculating the impact is not so simple.“When somebody says ‘You know the risk of the virus is not as great as the risks to everybody through a deteriorating economy’ that’s a choice that everybody will have to make” Feinberg said.In the case of the coronavirus crisis some economists and policy experts say the pandemic continues to present too many unknowns to employ the sort of coldly calculated cost-benefit analysis that’s been used to evaluate the impact of policies such as federal highway and air quality rules.“It doesn’t help to save the economy if a tremendous number of people have died or fallen ill and their lives are changed forever” said Lisa Heinzerling who grappled with regulatory impact on the economy as the head of EPA’s policy office at the beginning of the Obama administration.Northwestern University economists Martin Eichenbaum and Sergio Rebelo and German economist Mathias Trabandt said in a working paper published this week that optimal containment efforts would lead to deeper economic damage and that recession in the U.S. was inevitable. But the economists also projected that maintaining social-distancing measures before the U.S. hits its peak in infections “saves roughly half a million lives.""Stepping back from efforts to preserve human life in the midst of an event of this scale could also have enormous impact on the trust of institutions for generations to come said David Ropeik a former instructor of risk communication at the Harvard School of Public Health“The benefit of an all-out fight against a virus includes reassuring the public that the government is on their side. Backing off that fight reasonably questions whether the government we have created to protect us from things like this crisis will do so” said Ropeik the author of the book “How Risky Is It Really?""“The loss of that to protect the economy is undermining that faith. How can you price that?” he asked.For most people the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some especially older adults and people with existing health problems it can cause more severe illness including pneumonia and death. The vast majority of people recover."
87,New York and DC call out shortcomings of relief bill while others stand to gain,Cheyenne HaslettandAllison Pecorin,ABC,-1,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/york-dc-call-shortcomings-relief-bill-stand-gain/story?id=69813565,"Though the Senate's passage of a $2 trillion stimulus package Wednesday night was regarded as progress in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic leaders of some of the nation’s most affected cities issued sharp criticism that it just wasn’t enough.""The congressional action in my opinion simply failed to address the governmental need"" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a press conference on Thursday.""The only thing it's doing is helping us in the COVID virus expenses which is nice. But the bigger problem is on the lost revenues"" said the governor who is at the helm of the most infected state in the country. New York reported more than 30000 cases as of Thursday which is 15 times more than California and Washington state.Tune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team including the latest news context and analysis.According to the bill the allocation for New York and the other 49 states is determined by population not by how severely the state is affected by coronavirus. That’s why New York state which has plunged into debt fighting COVID-19 claims that the payment it is receiving is insufficient.But every state is guaranteed at least $1.25 billion under the bill which means states that are less populous than New York such as Wyoming or states with a higher population and fewer reported cases such as Texas could fare quite well. It's something Cuomo’s office has pointed to in frustration.""The gross political manipulation is obvious"" Dani Lever communications director for Cuomo said in a statement Wednesday -- subtly pointing out that both Texas and Wyoming are Republican states while New York is a reliably Democratic state.A few hundred miles south District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser expressed frustration because her city wouldn’t receive even the minimum of $1.25 billion. Instead the city -- which the bill will count alongside the territories even though all residents there pay federal income taxes -- would share one $3 billion dollar sum with the the other five U.S. territories divided up by population.By that math the nation's capital is expected to receive $500 million.The ""very idea of being treated like a territory is shocking infuriating. It’s wrong it’s outrageous"" Bowser said at a press conference Wednesday. ""We pay more taxes than 22 states. We have a larger population than several states. ... It’s unconscionable to give D.C. the least amount of funding of any state.""Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that the allocation for Washington ""makes no sense"" and suggested there could be other motivations for the perceived snub.""It doesn't face the realities of a public health crisis that we have in our country and goes out of its way to do something so out of the ordinary"" she said. ""But it was a decision. It wasn't an accident. It was a decision. So let's make a decision to correct that.""As Pelosi hinted both Cuomo and Bowser’s concerns could be taken up in the next round of stimulus efforts which Congress is already looking into.But for now Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer -- who Cuomo was in touch with about his sharp criticism -- said New York should be happy with what it got.""He wanted more to the state government and I told everybody he should take his case to Mitch McConnell"" Schumer who represents New York said of his conversations with Cuomo during a press conference Wednesday evening.New York residents will cumulatively get $40 billion in relief Schumer said because of the other assistance included in the bill that’s targeted at Americans regardless of state -- relief that will go to small business owners hospitals and unemployment insurance.And in fact the $2 trillion package will open the door for assistance far beyond even the states local businesses across the country or hospitals.Buried in 800 pages of text are clues to how how some Americans are going to experience a benefit from the stimulus package and how some are missing out.Who stands to gain?The telehealth industry: The bill relaxes restrictions for in-home care allowing more providers to do at home consultations and allowing more funding to allow for this care. Lawmakers emphasized telehealth care as one way to prevent non-critical COVID-19 patients from entering medical facilities and possibly spreading the virus.Those requiring unemployment benefits: The bill increases state unemployment benefits allowing those seeking unemployment to receive their state unemployment benefits plus an additional $600 per month. Schumer called it ""unemployment insurance on steroids."" Those facing unemployment due to the virus will also be eligible for four months of benefits.Local businesses: To call it a win might be a stretch since many businesses have already had to lay off workers or permanently shutter as non-essential businesses across the country have been ordered to close. Still the stimulus bill does allocate $350 billion for loans to be given to small businesses so that they can maintain payroll and cover other overhead expenses.If small businesses are able to limit their layoffs and meet other requirements these loans would turn into grants and be forgiven by the government.Hospitals: Hospitals are getting money to support staff enhance their capacities and equipment needs and secure more personal protective equipment for health care workers.The bill also allocates money for research into vaccines and treatments for coronavirus and places requirements on insurers to cover testing.Some in need of fast cash: American adults who are making less than $75000 singly or $150000 jointly can expect to see $1200 per adult in the coming weeks plus an additional $500 per child. Single adults making less than $99000 or couples making less than $198000 will receive some money though not the full $1200 amount. Those whose income is above that threshold will not receive any money."

That is an outright lie"" McCarthy R-Calif. told reporters. ""The fundamental portions of this bill has not changed [since] Sunday. Four months for unemployment was already decided on Sunday. The grant to keep employees hired on small business was already decided on Sunday. The only few additions were funding of things that had nothing to do with the coronavirus. Was that worth holding it up and more people being laid off? More people losing sleep more people wondering if they can continue? Those are the type of games that have to stop in Washington.""If those differences don't derail plans for passage on Friday the House will to meet at 9 a.m. to hold a short debate and then approve the massive bill by voice vote opting against a recorded roll call vote in order to avoid calling all 435 members back from recess to the Capitol.President Trump speculated there could be ""a grandstander"" who requests a recorded vote in the House delaying passage.""It'll pass"" he said. ""It'll just take a little longer.""At her news conference Pelosi who turned 80 years old Thursday dismissed concern that a single lawmaker will take advantage of current House rules to attempt to disrupt plans to approve the bill by voice vote by requesting a recorded roll call vote. Pelosi added she would not celebrate her birthday until she could hug her grand-babies.“We will have a victory tomorrow for America's workers” Pelosi predicted. “If somebody has a different point of view they can put it in the record but we're not worried about that.”McCarthy also said he expects members to debate and then vote to approve the legislation in a bipartisan fashion. He said if members wish to speak on the floor they will be sitting and standing far apart from one another and they'll also have to wipe down the podium when they're done talking.It remains an open question whether any Republicans or Democrats will disrupt plans for a voice vote as Kentucky Republican Rep.

Rand Paul who also tested positive for the virus.The Offices of the House Sergeant at Arms and Attending Physician issued a memo Thursday announcing unprecedented changes in the Capitol for tomorrow’s vote including limiting access for reporters.“Members should use extreme care and deliberation when making the determination to travel to Washington D.C” the memo warned. “In all cases Members and staff must maintain 6-foot social distance spacing as much as practicable when in the offices or the Capitol.”The Speaker’s Lobby will also be closed to reporters although the galleries on the balcony level will remain open to reporters. Anyone with a respiratory illness is also discouraged from attending the vote. In the event of a request for a recorded vote members would vote alphabetically in groups of 30.“Please note that throughout the vote we will be monitoring the number of Members in the Capitol and on the Floor to ensure we maintain safe social distancing at all times” the memo states. “Members who are ill with respiratory symptoms or fever are discouraged from attending.”Pelosi listed several provisions she hopes will be included in future legislation – including a “better definition” of who qualifies for Family and Medical leave stronger worker protections expanded life pensions an increase in food stamps and more money for state and local governments.With the Senate on recess until April 20 after Easter Pelosi said she believes the House must be ready to potentially act again earlier.""Everybody has to be on-call for what we need when we need it and we don't know what that might be” she said. “But whatever it is we'll be ready.""McCarthy downplayed the possibility of a fourth relief package after several Republicans and Democrats said that Congress may need to start working on its next emergency relief package to address the coronavirus crisis.""You have to let the bill work before I can answer questions about 'is it enough?'"" McCarthy said during a news conference at the Capitol. ""You're sitting here talking about needing another bill? If these bills are done correctly let them put them to work to get through this. If something is needed in the future lets make that decision. But lets not make that decision without allowing these bills to be put into the economy.""Pelosi said she plans to continue working mostly in Washington and encouraged the next bill to be negotiated on a bipartisan bicameral basis.“We really should be operating four corners” Pelosi said referring to the top House and Senate leadership. “This is all about the coronavirus. It's not about anything else. It’s about the coronavirus so this is temporary for this period of time.”As pundits weigh the winners and losers of the far-reaching relief package she said “it was curious” that the bill treated the District of Columbia “in a discriminatory way” by allocating funds to it in line with American territories rather than states.“It really makes no sense unless you have some other motivation” she said. “The District of Columbia has always been treated like a state in terms of distribution of funds.”“It doesn't face the realities of a public health crisis that we have in our country and goes out of its way to do something so out of the ordinary” she said. “But it was a decision. It wasn't an accident. It was a decision. So let's make a decision to correct that.”"
89,Partisanship in a pandemic: Democrats more concerned about virus than Republicans but increasing concern for all: Polls,Quinn Scanlan,ABC,-1,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/partisanship-pandemic-polling-shows-democrats-coronavirus-republicans-parties/story?id=69781489,"When the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a pandemic on March 11 about half of the U.S. population said COVID-19 was a ""major threat"" to the health of the country but more Democrats felt this way than Republicans according to polling from Pew Research Center.While the partisan divide still exists new polling from Pew Research out Thursday shows that across the board on both ends of the political spectrum more Americans now consider it a ""major threat"" to health as the pandemic continues to rapidly spread across the United States.According to the first Pew poll conducted between March 10 and March 16 59% of Democrats and independents who lean Democratic said the outbreak was a major threat to the population's health but only 33% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said the same.An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist College poll conducted within the same time frame from March 13 to March 14 showed a similar stark partisan gap: While 56% of Americans thought coronavirus was a ""real threat"" 76% of Democrats said it was but only 40% of Republicans said the same.Gary Langer longtime polling director for ABC News said partisan identity is formed by ""who people are.""""That's why it's pretty durable and it's also pretty persuasive. It's persuasive because it works as a shortcut"" he said.On March 13 President Donald Trump declared a national emergency but while he had started to ramp up his rhetoric round the seriousness of the virus even as he announced this significant step to respond to the outbreak his words and actions seemed at times at odds with the declaration.Despite having come in contact with someone who tested positive for the virus Trump shook hands with company CEOs in the Rose Garden; he doubted the country would ""need anywhere near"" 5 million COVID-19 tests; and he asserted ""it's totally unnecessary"" for asymptomatic people to be tested.""This will pass"" Trump assured America and days later the White House released recommended guidance titled ""15 Days to Slow the Spread.""Now 10 days after about 75000 Americans have tested positive for the virus putting the country only behind China and Italy where two of the worst outbreaks have occurred. The president has recently said he wants the country ""opened up"" by Easter just over two weeks away but at least 27 states plus the District of Columbia have active or soon to be active statewide closures of non-essential businesses and nearly 3.3 million Americans applied for unemployment in one week absolutely smashing the previous record of 695000.Jay Van Bavel an associate professor of psychology at New York University recently warned in a Washington Post op-ed that the differences between how seriously Democrats and Republicans are taking and responding to coronavirus shouldn't be overlooked.""The partisanship around estimating if you thought Trump's crowd sizes were bigger than Obama's like that seems like it's absurd but it's completely trivial"" Van Bavel told ABC News in an interview. ""This is the furthest thing from trivial... You can't imagine a more serious situation where partisanship and polarization could be deathly for people.""In the Marist poll noted earlier Democrats were more likely than Republicans to report cancelling plans to avoid crowds changing travel plans stocking up on food and supplies and choosing to eat at home more often.""My concern is that people are going to take more risky behavior"" Van Bavel said. ""I mean if you aren't ready for this thing within a couple weeks it takes hold and it grows exponentially. And so it's really hard to turn it around at that point.""""The virus doesn't care about your party affiliation or you political beliefs"" said Dr. Mark Lurie an associate professor of epidemiology at Brown University's School of Public Health. ""If you don't follow the CDC recommendations you're increasing (the chance) that you're going to get infected and that you're going to infect other people.""Lurie said that ""denialism"" is something that's been seen at the beginning of other epidemics but the more coronavirus ""infiltrates our daily lives the more people are going to take it more seriously.""While the partisan gap doesn't seem to be lessening quite yet there are signs it's headed that way as more Americans across the board are viewing it more seriously.In the Pew Research study published Thursday 66% of Americans now think coronavirus is a ""major threat"" to the health of the U.S. population up from 47% in the poll published a week ago. Among Americans who identify with either party though the percentage of people who think this has gone up 19 points.In the course of about two weeks Gallup saw a similar trend over three polls. Between March 13 and 15 just 12% of Republicans said they were avoiding small gatherings with friends and family compared to 32% of Democrats who said they were doing that. Between March 20 and March 22 Gallup saw jumps of about 45 percentage points for people who identified with both parties reporting they were avoiding small gatherings. In the same time-frame there was a similar 40 point increase among Republicans and Democrats who said they were avoiding public places like restaurants and stores but the 20 point partisan gap still existed.Notably there's been much less of a partisan gap in some polling on coronavirus in particular polling about public health officials and state and local government.In the Pew Research poll released March 18 87% of Republicans and Republican-leaners and 81% of Democrats and Democratic-leaners said they were either very or somewhat confident that CDC public health officials were doing a good job responding to the virus. In the Marist poll 87% of Democrats and 80% of Republicans said they trusted information from public health officials either a great deal or good amount.""To the extent that we ask a question that's more political in nature partisan predispositions are more likely to inform it and as we move away from political issues you still can have partisan influences but they tend to subside"" Langer said.In the Pew poll out Thursday the lack of partisanship persists.""Clear majorities of Democrats and Republicans say public health officials like those in the CDC are doing an excellent or good job"" said Jocelyn Kiley associate director of research at Pew. Kiley added that for state and local officials there's ""very little partisan difference"" in how they're evaluated and generally they get high marks.This was also seen in the last Pew Research poll when compared to public health officials there was even more bipartisanship agreement regarding state and local officials with nearly the same percentage of Democrats and Republicans saying they were either very or somewhat confident in those officials. In a poll from Monmouth University released Monday 76% of Democrats and 73% of Republicans said their state's governor has done a good job.""People trust their local government more than their county government their county government more than their state government their state government more than the federal government. That's consistent across almost any measurement we can take -- the more local the less removed the more personal the greater the trust"" Langer explained.However while the partisan gap around how good the response has been at the state and local level is nearly nonexistent there is difference in how Republican versus Democratic officials have responded.Twenty-six states have Republican governors but of the 27 states that have either implemented or ordered the closure of non-essential business statewide only seven of them have a Republican as their chief executive.The four states with the most number of cases in the United States all have Democratic governors but in Florida the state with the fifth most cases according to Johns Hopkins University Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has resisted ordering the same closures. Excluding Massachusetts in the two states represented by Republicans with the next highest number of cases Georgia and Texas the governors haven't ordered these closures yet either.In the latest Pew study while Kiley said there was ""a fair amount of partisan agreement"" among Americans that steps taken like limiting international travel and cancelling major sporting and entertainment events have been necessary by a 20-point margin Democrats were more likely than Republicans to say that closing non-essential businesses was necessary action.""One possibility is that Republicans will start to take it more seriously as it starts to reach into their neighborhoods... you might see that as it spreads into more and more red states and suburbs... you might see that partisan gap closes even more because then it becomes a really undeniable risk factor for people"" NYU's Van Bavel told ABC News.""I would expect in the future that (the partisan gap) would eventually get washed away because enough people will have had enough personal experience in their families with the virus that denialism will be impossible to maintain"" said Lurie the epidemiology professor at Brown."
90,USDA relaxes requirements for parents to pick up schools meals as some are still being turned away,Stephanie Ebbs,ABC,-1,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/usda-relaxes-requirements-parents-pick-schools-meals-turned/story?id=69824203,"After a push from states and advocates the U.S. Department of Agriculture has waived a requirement that children have to be physically present with their parents to pick up meals at closed schools around the country.But in at least one state schools were still turning away parents who showed up on Thursday to pick up meals without their children.The USDA waiver says that schools can provide meals to parents or guardians to bring home to their children but that states must have a process to verify that meals are distributed only to eligible children and that families aren’t picking up duplicate meals for any student.The Texas Department of Agriculture announced the waiver was approved and it was reported in local news outlets but school officials said they told districts separately they could not give out meals until the department creates guidance for accountability for those handouts.Irma Munoz chief operating officer at IDEA Public Schools a network of charter schools in Texas and Louisiana said that because of the confusion their schools in Texas have been turning away parents who showed up without their children.""Right now it’s stuck in this bureaucratic limbo and we’re the ones having to respond to parents"" Munoz told ABC News.The Texas Department of Agriculture said they expect to make progress on issuing guidance to clarify the requirements on Thursday night but they still encourage schools to hand out meals until it's finalized just that there’s no guarantee they would be reimbursed for those meals.""We are not saying they should not provide the meals. We want children to be fed that need to be fed. That is the first and foremost priority"" spokesman Mark Loeffler said in an emailed statement. ""We have said this is not the time for arguing or holding back meals. Provide the meals. The plan will be in place as soon as possible.""A spokeswoman for the Food and Nutrition Service confirmed that the waiver goes into effect immediately and applies to all states that elect to use it.IDEA Public Schools have served more than 170000 meals in less than a week to students and children in the surrounding community Munoz said but they still don’t know if they’ll be reimbursed. 85 percent of the 53000 students they serve qualify for free and reduced lunch and rely on school for at least two of their meals per day.She said they decided to move forward with providing meals without confirmation of how regulations would be applied but that ""it would be an incredibly big financial hit"" if they’re not reimbursed for all the food they’re providing.Hundreds of school districts around the country are closed for weeks months or indefinitely forcing them to adapt quickly to provide meals for students whose main source of healthy food was from their school cafeteria. School officials have also transitioned their summer meal programs into options to deliver meals by bus or offer curbside pickup but still have to figure out how to comply with state and federal regulations in an unprecedented situation.Virginia Del. Danica Roem who represents western Prince William County and the city of Manassas Park took it upon herself to bring groceries to constituents who were unable to pick up food from schools because of the rule.Roem paid for the groceries with her own money she said but considers it a small price compared to the hurdles facing some families in her district.""They have immunocompromised children who shouldn't you know [be scared]"" she told ABC News. ""They shouldn't be having panic attacks they shouldn't be worrying about whether they're going to eat or whether their health is going to be at stake ... from going outside.""Back in Texas Munoz said that in addition to the confusion over the requirement a child be present her schools are trying to get clarity on how many meals they can provide.""We typically provide three meals at school breakfast lunch and supper -- which is the last meal that our kids get before they leave school"" Munoz said. ""And right now we are unclear about our ability to provide supper but more specifically our ability to provide supper bundled with breakfast and lunch.""While it may not seem ""so big of a deal"" she said it is more of a hassle for parents to have to pick up breakfast and lunch in the morning and then have to come back in the afternoon ""to pick up supper.""USDA guidance on providing meals through summer food service programs -- what schools are using during the COVID-19 emergency -- said they will reimburse schools for two meals or a meal and a snack for every day that the school is closed.States will also allow schools to give parent’s permission to get up to a week of meals at once; but USDA will still only reimburse the school for two meals at a time according to officials.""Those types of flexibilities in these times given school closures given that there's just scarcity of food among nonprofit organizations that do traditional you know feeding for at-risk populations"" Munoz said. ""It's just an added burden that we don't need and our families don't need.""The Agriculture Department said it’s ""working to be as flexible as possible"" to get food out during the national emergency and has waived some requirements to make it easier to provide meals outside a traditional school setting such as rules that students must eat the meals on site and allowing schools to deliver more than one meal at once and outside normal meal times.States and anti-hunger advocates are pushing USDA to lift additional requirements including a rule that 50% of students must be eligible for free and reduced lunch for schools in some states to provide meals to any children in the community.Food banks are also seeing sharp increases in demand for food assistance as millions more people are out of work and looking for the best way to help while keeping up with demand and protecting their own staff.Andrew Cheyne director of government affairs with the California Association of Food Banks said they worked with the state to allow changes to limit contact between staff and community members like allowing staff to sign people in and providing pre-packaged food as well as allowing food banks to distribute at schools so families can receive more aid."
91,It's Not Just the Presidential Race Adjusting to the Coronavirus,ADAM HARRIS,The Atlantic,-1,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-campaign/608713/,Lori feagan’s campaign buttons came in three weeks ago. The Democrat running for the state legislative seat in Washington’s Fourth District was looking forward to handing them out at the full slate of events she had scheduled—fundraisers conventions door-knocking. By the next week she had canceled all that. Washington was the first state in the country to report a confirmed case of the novel coronavirus. And despite the warnings from overseas—China Italy—Washington is where the deadly severity of the virus first came into view for millions of Americans. As other candidates began strategizing on how to move campaign events online Feagan a nurse practitioner who specializes in internal medicine threw herself back into the work of treating patients.“We had to refocus” Feagan told me when I called her on Monday evening. She had just returned home from another 10-hour day of telehealth medicine in the Spokane Valley—triaging patients over the phone for upper-respiratory symptoms in hopes of keeping them from overwhelming clinics. “I need to take care of the people in my district and the people in my community” she said. “This week I’m a nurse practitioner.”Retail politics in America are on hold. And although they don’t make much of a difference in presidential races John Sides a political-science professor at Vanderbilt University told me in-person events are the lifeblood for candidates running down-ballot for positions in institutions such as the U.S. House of Representatives state Senates city councils and local school boards.“I don’t think anybody is going to pay attention to anything other than the coronavirus” the political strategist James Carville told me. “It’s like 1943” the middle of World War II he said. “What the fuck else is there to talk about?”Even as it’s made running for office harder the coronavirus crisis has highlighted the importance of state and local governments. When Americans have sought steady leadership they have more often found it in those officials than the federal government. As my colleagues Robinson Meyer and Alexis C. Madrigal wrote this weekend federal officials “took only illogical inadequate actions to stop the virus’s spread” when it was ravaging the Wuhan province in China and botched the development of tests that could have helped the nation understand the severity of the problem.Many people running for local and state office such as Feagan are not full-time candidates. Many of them are parents whose lives are now in flux because of school closures or job losses said Amanda Litman a co-founder of Run for Something which helps recruit young people to run for elected office. “Many of them work in jobs that might be considered first responders right now” she told me. “That means they are now balancing working from home or really high-stress jobs with taking care of their kids [and] with campaigning. That was hard enough when campaigning meant going to events at night and knocking doors all weekend. It’s 10 times harder now.”For incumbents the best thing they can do for constituents is carry out their job. Challengers don’t necessarily have that built-in outlet for demonstrating leadership though. They’ll have to use television and digital advertising to get their messages out. But the down-ballot races where that advertising is most needed in lieu of in-person campaigning are the ones with the least money to get on the air.That’s less of a problem in congressional races—where donors target large sums of money—than local and some state contests. “We know that a lot of voting and congressional races [are] nationalized” Sides told me. In those races candidates may be more likely to tether themselves to national issues such as health care or tax reform—issues that are intimately linked to the commander in chief. “So it’s really people’s feelings about conditions in the country as a whole and especially their feelings about the president driving some of these [election] outcomes.”From the beginning President Donald Trump undersold the severity of the virus to the American people and made promises about the government’s ability to contain it that he could not keep. Republican legislators uniformly held the party line on his messaging. And by slow-walking the crisis a bad situation has become exponentially worse.Typically such national issues would not affect local races Elizabeth Doyel a political strategist at Superior Blue Strategies a Democratic consulting group told me. “It’s sexier to talk about the president or a U.S. senator” Doyel said. “But I think that we are seeing that the mayors and city-council members are the most important to us” in times of crisis.Leadership doesn’t come only from elected officials though. And so Lori Feagan is back to being a nurse practitioner for now. On her Facebook page public-service announcements advising people to support Meals on Wheels providing information on how they can receive unemployment benefits and explaining how to renew driver’s licenses have replaced event announcements. She’s adopted a new slogan of sorts one she has used time and again as a nurse practitioner: “How are you and how can I help?”She’s not explicitly asking for votes and she told me that she’ll probably start doing Zoom events soon but for now this is what her campaign looks like.“I hope that our voters will appreciate that” Feagan told me “and when the time comes for us to pick back up where we left off I hope that we’ll have their support.”
92,A Marine General’s Next Battle: Grocery-Store Logistics,KATHY GILSINAN,The Atlantic,-1,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/military-general-restocking-grocery-store-america-afghanistan/608626/,Two years ago Lieutenant General Larry Nicholson was leading a roughly 30000-strong Marine Expeditionary Force in Japan that forms part of America’s post–World War II presence in Asia. At one point he commanded about 20000 troops in Afghanistan’s Helmand province the most violent in the country at the time to fight the Taliban. So when he retired in 2018 after almost four decades of service and moved to Tennessee to manage supply-chain logistics in Knoxville he thought he’d left behind the battlefield forever.And for a while that was true. He spent his time visiting warehouses talking to teams of employees about getting food and medicine to various convenience stores around the country. But with the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the country Nicholson is once again at war—trying to keep food and medicine stocked to keep America fed without endangering the health of drivers packagers and managers.Nicholson is a vice president at the wholesaler H. T. Hackney which has 4000 employees and serves 20000 stores from Miami to Detroit. He and I spoke recently about how he applies his battlefield experience to his job how the coronavirus crisis has many parallels with Afghanistan (including toilet-paper shortages) and what Napoleon might have to do with grocery logistics. The conversation has been edited and condensed for length and clarity.Kathy Gilsinan: Were you expecting in retirement that your life wouldn’t be as stressful as it was in the Marines?Larry Nicholson: I did not expect this. I thought I’d come into the private sector and learn a lot about supply chains and hopefully be able to contribute in some areas. I never expected to be in a crisis like this. There are a lot of parallels to my previous life.Gilsinan: What are you seeing now? What is your day-to-day like?Nicholson: It’s very much like being in the military. We are at a high alert. There’s things you take for granted that the stores are going to be full that the shelves are going to be full and I think we’re working through the crisis here. There’s a heightened sense of service in the sense that our drivers our warehouse guys everybody feels like “Hey you know we are an essential service.” We deliver to 20000 stores. Our customers and the communities that they serve have never been more dependent upon us so there’s just this sense of obligation. We’re a critically important part of the supply chain as a wholesaler distributing to these companies.During this period for a lot of people the local [convenience store] especially in the rural areas that’s where they’re buying their food. That’s where they’re buying the milk eggs or their paper products if you can find them. Based on our role in the supply chain we are considered to be an essential company that’s got to be out there. So our employees are hard at work. A lot of them have to carry passes; in certain states they’ve got to be able to show that.Gilsinan: How do you think your experience in the military helps you now?Nicholson: Tremendously. I mean just beyond the leadership thing the understanding of logistics. You know the old quote [sometimes attributed to Napoleon]: “Amateurs talk tactics; professionals talk logistics.” Whether you’re in Afghanistan or Iraq or here at home you’re not going to be successful unless that supply chain is working for you.Gilsinan: What are the parallels between you being in Marjah Afghanistan trying to get ammunition to the troops versus making sure there’s toilet paper at convenience stores in Detroit?Nicholson: I think about how lucky we were even in the remote areas of Iraq and Afghanistan [to have a functioning] supply chain. The ammunition is one thing but [there’s also] the food the sanitation and the basic lifesaving support—things that you need to keep combat troops healthy and in the fight. I think we feel very much the same way here. We have things we need to get out to the community. But we all understood in Iraq and Afghanistan that without a supply chain that actually was responsive and functioning we would not be successful. And we feel the same way here.Gilsinan: Did you ever experience a toilet-paper shortage in Afghanistan?Nicholson: Um Kathy I’ll tell you that we went to alternate ways. Sometimes it went toilet paper. Sometimes there were other things. Without getting too graphic some were better than others. But I think for the most part if we didn’t have nice squishy rolls of toilet paper we had something that uh that took care of the job.Gilsinan: So did you find the supply chains actually more reliable when you were in Afghanistan versus now? What are the challenges you see now that you didn’t see then?Nicholson: No I think the supply chain is reliable and my sense is that we don’t have a shortage of toilet paper—people are not using more toilet paper than they did a month ago. They’re just hoarding it somewhere. I know that paper-product manufacturers are cranking out more. And our job is to just keep pushing product out there.Gilsinan: How are you keeping your employees safe because they have to be out there?Nicholson: The two biggest things for us are accomplish the mission and take care of your people. In the Marine Corps I used to talk about [how those are the only two] reasons we have leaders and officers.We’re going to great lengths to keep our folks healthy. So far we’ve been incredibly fortunate; at this point we’re zero COVID-19 positive. We are getting people tested and anybody that doesn’t feel great doesn’t even think about coming to work.But from 32 different locations every day there’s issues you’re trying to solve and you make the best decisions that you can. In a lot of ways the combat analogies are [apt]. You never have perfect intel on the battlefield. You think you’ve got a pretty good idea of what the enemy’s doing but you don’t have perfect intel. And it’s the same thing here; we never have perfect intel and our team is out there walking into stores every day delivering. Success is entirely based on our people and their ability to do their job and [keeping] them healthy. So we’re doing everything we can.Gilsinan: How have the protocols for your drivers changed day-to-day?Nicholson: The trucks are rolling; they’ve got plenty of hand sanitizer; they’ve got wipes. After each delivery [the drivers] go through a sanitation process where everything they touch they clean. So even in the store they’re wiping down the areas they’re in.Gilsinan: What else reminds you of the Afghanistan experience?Nicholson: Our guys intuitively understand their critical role in the crisis here. The other thing is for teammates that are potentially exposed are we providing the best care? You know how are we rapidly responding to situations where somebody may have come in contact? The same way we focused on immediate medical attention the “golden hour” trying to take care of our marines. The “golden hour” in Iraq and Afghanistan was the sense that if you could get a wounded marine into resuscitative care surgery within an hour his chance of surviving increased exponentially. If it took more than an hour then his chances of survival diminished significantly.Gilsinan: So how are you applying that concept now when you think about employees who may have been exposed?Nicholson: We have our own protocols that ensure that they get immediate medical attention.We’re doing everything we can to make sure that our folks that need to be tested are tested and that folks that we need to quarantine we quarantine. The terrible scenario is if you have people out there working that would be infected. So we’re incredibly cautious and always on watch for anybody that needs medical care to make sure they get it. You know marines knew that Hey if I get hit man I know I’m going to get world-class medical care right away. I think our employees have to know that the same holds true here.Gilsinan: You mentioned imperfect intel like you at one point were motivating people to go outside the wire and they didn’t necessarily know if they were going to come back. And now you have 4000 people that are going to work and not necessarily sure if they’re going to get sick. How do you handle that problem?Nicholson: These delivery drivers are stopping at 14 15 20 stores a day and they’re going into these stores multiple times with hand trucks full of food and then [they get] back in a truck and [move] on to the next spot. For any of those folks obviously there is risk. They are kind of the unsung heroes of this fight; we should tip our cap to them because they’re out there. They are keeping those stores as full as we can. I certainly understand that the workers at greatest peril during this period are the medical professionals. So I was always incredibly proud of our marines and their ability to continue to get out there and get after the enemy. And I’m equally proud today of our folks here that understand this risk. And yet still every day they’re on the road and they’re hitting those stores.Kathy: The intensity of the Afghanistan experience I’m sure is still something that you carry with you. I’m wondering what would be the nightmare scenario now for you and your job?Nicholson: The concern is always we just don’t know where this thing’s going. None of us know how long this will last.Gilsinan: Do you see a scenario in which your guys would have to scale back on deliveries?Nicholson: I just can’t imagine [they] would. That would be a nightmare scenario because that means things have gone terribly wrong as critical as we are right now to keeping people healthy. You want strong immune systems. Well you better be sure that they’re well nourished.Gilsinan: This is a very anxious time for a lot of people. It’s an anxiety that most Americans I think have never experienced. But you yourself have been in extremely intense situations and dealt with stress like this. As a leader do you have any words of wisdom for coping with massive uncertainty like this?Nicholson: The thing we encourage our leaders to do is be out there be steady be strong encourage people. Keep your sense of humor. Everyone takes cues from their leaders. And if your leader’s confident he can get across the critical importance of this mission and why everybody’s doing their job here to help our nation through this.For a lot of these people hopefully there will never be a bigger crisis in their lives. They won’t have been to combat. And this will be the greatest test a lot of these guys face.Gilsinan: Afghanistan is such a complicated conflict and I don’t know that it was always clear to U.S. troops on the ground why exactly they were there. Is the mission here clearer?Nicholson: For the guys on the ground [in Afghanistan] that were actually doing the daily missions I think there was an incredible sense of gratification. [Going after] the Taliban but also helping the people I think they could see some of these towns come back to life. They could see schools opening. They could see markets opening. There’s always time later to debate about whether we should or shouldn’t have [been there]. There will be no debate in the future about whether we should continue to feed our nation. That’s kind of a slam dunk.
93,Why America Is Uniquely Unsuited to Dealing With the Coronavirus,URI FRIEDMAN,The Atlantic,-1,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-united-states-vulnerable-pandemic/608686/,President Donald Trump has characterized the coronavirus crisis as “a time of shared national sacrifice” but here’s the hard truth: The nation has never in living memory had to collectively sacrifice quite like this.Geography has bestowed upon the United States the blessing of being surrounded as a former NATO chief once put it to me by friends and fish: Canada Mexico and two oceans. Even when the homeland has come under attack—at Pearl Harbor on 9/11—we responded by fighting the enemy over there so we would not have to fight it back here. When it comes to national-security threats here has long been a refuge a fortress. Hence perhaps the impulse in the U.S. when the coronavirus began spreading to prioritize keeping the threat there (via travel restrictions) over preparing for when it got here (by bolstering the health-care system to withstand a surge of cases).Now for the first time in generations the homefront has become the battleground in this case for the fight against an invisible foe undaunted by borders and oceans and America’s traditional defenses.Suddenly America now home to one of the world’s worst outbreaks of the virus has discovered that it isn’t really wired for the all-of-society struggle that’s needed to fight the coronavirus. We do have many obvious strengths in this fight—we’re a wealthy nation a hub for technological and scientific innovation a democratic society with free-flowing information and a leader in handling global-health crises. But the outbreak has also exposed weaknesses that put the country at a disadvantage from the start particularly relative to other rich democracies that are confronting the same disease but have managed if only partially so far to flatten their curve. In the United States the virus has struck a highly polarized fragmented and individualistic society one not haunted and transformed by a previous epidemic the way other societies have been. These factors along with the Trump administration’s failures to take the threat of the virus seriously when it first emerged placed the United States squarely on the back foot in its battle against COVID-19.MORE STORIESAn illustration of a chart with a downward facing arrow.This Is Just the BeginningYASCHA MOUNKDonald TrumpTrump Is Inciting a Coronavirus Culture War to Save HimselfADAM SERWERCOVID-19 Lessons for World Leaders From Medieval LiteratureTOM MCTAGUEOne of the lessons from the various ways countries have responded to this pandemic is that swift inventive and aggressive testing and social-distancing measures are crucial to success. Another however is that—to channel Donald Rumsfeld’s infamous remark about the conflict in Iraq—you go to war against this virus with the country you have not the country you might wish you had. The virus has landed in a diverse array of countries with remarkably similar force. What’s made the difference is the countervailing force that each nation has brought to bear.While the United States has dealt with numerous disease outbreaks abroad in recent years including SARS Zika and Ebola this is the first time that many of its residents are experiencing such a traumatic overwhelming public-health emergency. In contrast several of the democracies that have made the most progress in combating the virus including South Korea Taiwan and Hong Kong (along with authoritarian countries such as Singapore) bore scars from previous epidemics that spurred them to act quickly when a novel coronavirus was first reported in China in late 2019. The U.S. government prides itself on being prepared for 21st-century threats such as cyberwarfare and “great-power competition” but it wasn’t nearly as prepared for the modern danger of pandemic disease. A new University of Oxford study of government responses to COVID-19 indicates that while the rate at which states have adopted stringent measures (school closings travel restrictions bans on public gatherings and so on) has played “a critical role in stemming the infection” the stringency of the U.S. response for weeks lagged behind its growth in new cases.The United States and South Korea for instance each confirmed their first coronavirus case within a day of the other in late January. But South Korea raced far ahead of the U.S. in testing its population for COVID-19 and was able to contain the spread. This week as infections in the United States soared South Korea reported its lowest number of new coronavirus cases since a peak on February 29 emerging as the world leader in coronavirus diagnostics.The South Korean government acted in part out of a desire to avoid repeating the previous administration’s bungled reaction to the spread of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or MERS in 2015. The country’s outbreak of that disease the largest outside the Middle East featured a harrowing transmission chain through the nation’s hospitals and killed more than 30 people. It also motivated authorities to hone their systems for testing suspected cases and tracing and isolating infected patients and their contacts. Authorities even introduced new laws granting the government powers to collect anonymized personal data from people who test positive so their movements and contacts can be identified.C. Jason Wang a Stanford professor who has studied Taiwan’s COVID-19 response similarly told me that the SARS outbreak was seared into “the psyche of the Taiwanese people.” Especially distressing were scenes such as the quarantining of an entire hospital for weeks in 2003. Seventy-three people died which Wang said registers in a small country such as Taiwan. In its aftermath the government created a National Health Command Center and like South Korea empowered authorities to track people and control the production of vital medical supplies during an epidemic.Wang noted that the command center which he described as essentially 100 people in a bunker continuously coordinating information from central and local governments was activated on January 20 of this year even before the first coronavirus case in Taiwan was confirmed. Well before that at the end of December when the World Health Organization was still looking into a mysterious pneumonia in Wuhan China Taiwanese authorities were boarding planes and checking passengers on direct flights from the city for pneumonia symptoms. Within weeks officials had cut off travel from Wuhan and were tracking cellphones to make sure those who had been quarantined were staying at home.The Trump administration acted far less expeditiously. When China began confining many millions of people to their homes in January the U.S. government should have gotten the message that this was serious the Yale sociologist and physician Nicholas Christakis told me. “We lost six weeks” in the United States to prepare—“to build ventilators get protective equipment organize our ICUs get tests ready prepare the public for what was going to happen so that our economy didn’t tank as badly. None of this was done adequately by our leaders.”Taiwan which also confirmed its first coronavirus case within a day of America’s currently has more than 200 confirmed cases compared with more than 50000 in the U.S. This is all the more remarkable given as Wang and his co-authors note in their article that “Taiwan is 81 miles off the coast of mainland China and was expected to have the second highest number of cases of [COVID-19] due to its proximity to and number of flights between China.”Taiwan a territory that neighboring China claims as its own and South Korea which is threatened by North Korea are also far more accustomed than the United States to existential danger lurking nearby. “Given that Taiwan has faced everything from its giant neighbor—the spreading of fake news military threats the withholding of vital medical information during the SARS outbreak in 2003—the country knows it must be on its fullest guard whenever any major problem emerges in China” the Taiwan-based journalist Hilton Yip recently wrote in Foreign Policy.Wang for example pointed out that Taiwan has a vice premier who doubles as the country’s chief information-security officer because of the constant threat of Chinese cyberattacks. When coronavirus descended on the country this official was able to integrate the state’s immigration and customs database with its national health-insurance database and use big-data analytics in real time so that “when somebody got off the airplane from Wuhan and went to see a doctor the doctor would get an alert saying ‘this person just came from Wuhan.’”The U.S. response by contrast has been hobbled in part by low levels of trust in government and high levels of partisanship reflected in how even the concept of social distancing has become politicized. “While anxiety about the disease is rising on both sides of the partisan divide Democrats consistently express much more concern about it than Republicans do and they are much more likely to say they have changed their personal behavior as a result” my colleague Ronald Brownstein wrote recently. (South Korea too is intensely politically polarized but more than a fifth of those who support the opposition party approve of the government’s response to the virus.)When people are operating on different sets of facts national solidarity is elusive Eric Klinenberg a sociologist at New York University told me. Efforts to impose “physical distancing and isolation only works if people respect the order and take heed of the scientific facts … You can’t promote public health without social solidarity. Here is a case where it’s clear that our fate is linked to the fate of our neighbors.”In the United States moreover “we have not just cultural fragmentation but political fragmentation” in terms of how power is divided among government agencies and between the federal government and states and localities he added. This has been a major factor in why the rollout of COVID-19 testing and the overall response has been so sluggish and haphazard in the U.S. relative to more centralized governments such as South Korea’s. And it helps explain why the United States with its individualistic creed and decentralized power structure hasn’t yet imposed a nationwide lockdown despite suffering more coronavirus deaths than a country such as France had when it announced its lockdown.“When the state is seen as smart and generous and honest and competent when state programs are seen as normal and good not stigmatized I think that elevates levels of solidarity and trust” Klinenberg said. “When you have a market-based hyper-individualistic system organized around distrust and fragmentation as we have here the cultural response … is to do everything possible to protect yourself: You buy up all the toilet paper. You stockpile cold medications. You use your celebrity status to get yourself a COVID-19 test.”Klinenberg noted that while the U.S. government is scrambling to make all sorts of emergency policy changes from ensuring paid sick leave to buttressing the public-health system the measures are too little too late. What they signal however is that this emergency will reshape the nation. “I think that the America that we make in the aftermath of this disaster looks very different than the America we live in today” he said. For decades other countries were shaped by the traumas of disease outbreaks while the United States remained largely untouched. No longer.
94,All the President’s Lies About the Coronavirus,CHRISTIAN PAZ,The Atlantic,-1,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/trumps-lies-about-coronavirus/608647/,Updated at 6:30 p.m. E.T. on March 25 2020.In the 11 days since he declared the coronavirus pandemic a national emergency President Donald Trump has repeatedly lied about this once-in-a-generation crisis.Here a collection of the biggest lies he’s told as the nation barrels toward a public-health and economic calamity. This post will be updated as needed.On the Nature of the VirusWhen: Friday February 7 and Wednesday February 19The claim: The coronavirus would weaken “when we get into April in the warmer weather—that has a very negative effect on that and that type of a virus.”The truth: It’s too early to tell if the virus’s spread will be dampened by warmer conditions. Respiratory viruses can be seasonal but the World Health Organization says that the new coronavirus “can be transmitted in ALL AREAS including areas with hot and humid weather.”When: Thursday February 27The claim: The outbreak would be temporary: “It’s going to disappear. One day it’s like a miracle—it will disappear.”The truth: Anthony Fauci the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases warned days later that he was concerned that “as the next week or two or three go by we’re going to see a lot more community-related cases.”The claim: If the economic shutdown continues deaths by suicide “definitely would be in far greater numbers than the numbers that we’re talking about” for COVID-19 deaths.The truth: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that in a worst-case scenario 200000 to 1.7 million Americans could die from COVID-19 The New York Times reports. Other estimates place the number of possible deaths at 1.1 million to 1.2 million. According to the CDC suicide is one of the leading causes of death in the United States. But the number of people who died by suicide in 2017 for example was roughly 47000—nowhere near the COVID-19 estimates.Blaming the Obama AdministrationWhen: Wednesday March 4The claim: The Trump White House rolled back Food and Drug Administration regulations that limited the kind of laboratory tests states could run and how they could conduct them. “The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we’re doing” Trump said.The truth: The Obama administration drafted but never implemented changes to rules that regulate laboratory tests run by states. Trump’s policy change relaxed an FDA requirement that would have forced private labs to wait for FDA authorization to conduct their own non-CDC-approved coronavirus tests.When: Friday March 13The claim: The Obama White House’s response to the H1N1 pandemic was “a full scale disaster with thousands dying and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem until now.”The truth: Barack Obama declared a public-health emergency two weeks after the first U.S. cases of H1N1 were reported in California. (Trump declared a national emergency more than seven weeks after the first domestic COVID-19 case was reported in Washington State.) While testing is a problem now it wasn’t back in 2009. The challenge then was vaccine development: Production was delayed and the vaccine wasn’t distributed until the outbreak was already waning.On Coronavirus TestingWhen: Friday March 6The claim: “Anybody that needs a test gets a test. We—they’re there. They have the tests. And the tests are beautiful.”The truth: The country’s testing capabilities are severely limited. Many states have experienced a lack of testing kits as my colleagues Alexis Madrigal and Robinson Meyer have reported. Trump made this claim one day after his own vice president Mike Pence admitted that “we don’t have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward.”When: Wednesday March 11The claim: In an Oval Office address Trump said that private health-insurance companies had “agreed to waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments extend insurance coverage to these treatments and to prevent surprise medical billing.”The truth: Insurers agreed only to absorb the cost of coronavirus testing—waiving co-pays and deductibles for getting the test. Follow-up treatments aren’t covered. Neither are the costs of other non-coronavirus testing or treatment incurred by patients who have COVID-19 or are trying to get a diagnosis. And as for surprise medical billing? Mitigating it would require the cooperation of insurers doctors and hospitals.When: Friday March 13The claim: Google engineers are building a website to help Americans determine whether they need testing for the coronavirus and to direct them to their nearest testing site.The truth: The announcement was news to Google itself—the website Trump (and other administration officials) described was actually being built by Verily a division of Alphabet the parent company of Google. The Verge first reported on Trump’s error citing a Google representative who confirmed that Verily was working on a “triage website” with limited coverage for the San Francisco Bay Area. But since then Google has pivoted to fulfill Trump’s public proclamation saying it would speed up the development of a new separate website while Verily worked on finishing its project The Washington Post reported.When: Tuesday March 24 and Wednesday March 25The claim: The United States has outpaced South Korea’s COVID-19 testing: “We’re going up proportionally very rapidly” Trump said during a Fox News town hall.The truth: While in absolute numbers Trump is right about the number of tests administered in the United States the country still lags behind South Korea’s testing relative to its population. South Korea has conducted about five times as many tests as a proportion of its population relative to the United States. As of this writing the U.S. has conducted roughly 430000 tests according to the COVID-19 Tracking Project while South Korea has conducted about 350000 according to the Korean Center for Disease Control.On Travel Bans and TravelersWhen: Wednesday March 11The claim: The United States would suspend “all travel from Europe except the United Kingdom for the next 30 days” Trump announced in an Oval Office address.The truth: The travel restriction would not apply to U.S. citizens legal permanent residents or their families returning from Europe. At first it applied specifically to the 26 European countries that make up the Schengen Area not all of Europe. Trump later announced the inclusion of the United Kingdom and Ireland in the ban.Another claim: In the same address Trump said the travel restrictions would “not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo but various other things as we get approval.”The truth: Trump followed up in a tweet explaining that trade and cargo would not be subject to the restrictions.When: Thursday March 12The claim: All U.S. citizens arriving from Europe would be subject to medical screening COVID-19 testing and quarantine if necessary. “If an American is coming back or anybody is coming back we’re testing” Trump said. “We have a tremendous testing setup where people coming in have to be tested … We’re not putting them on planes if it shows positive but if they do come here we’re quarantining.”The truth: Testing is already severely limited in the United States. It is not true that all Americans returning to the country are being tested nor that anyone is being forced to quarantine CNN has reported.On Taking the Pandemic SeriouslyWhen: Tuesday March 17The claim: “I’ve always known this is a real—this is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic … I’ve always viewed it as very serious.”The truth: Trump has repeatedly downplayed the significance of COVID-19 as outbreaks began stateside. From calling criticism of his handling of the virus a “hoax” to comparing the coronavirus to a common flu to worrying about letting sick Americans off cruise ships because they would increase the number of confirmed cases Trump has used his public statements to send mixed messages and sow doubt about the outbreak’s seriousness.On COVID-19 Treatments and VaccinesWhen: Monday March 2The claim: Pharmaceutical companies are going “to have vaccines I think relatively soon.”The truth: The president’s own experts told him during a White House meeting with pharmaceutical leaders earlier that same day that a vaccine could take a year to 18 months to develop. In response he said he would prefer if it took only a few months. He later claimed at a campaign rally in Charlotte North Carolina that a vaccine would be ready “soon.”When: Thursday March 19The claim: At a press briefing with his coronavirus task force Trump said the FDA had approved the antimalarial drug chloroquine to treat COVID-19. “Normally the FDA would take a long time to approve something like that and it’s—it was approved very very quickly and it’s now approved by prescription” he said.The truth: FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn who was at the briefing quickly clarified that the drug still had to be tested in a clinical setting. An FDA representative later told Bloomberg that the drug has not been approved for COVID-19 use though a doctor could still prescribe it for that purpose. Later that same day Fauci told CNN that there is no “magic drug” to cure COVID-19: “Today there are no proven safe and effective therapies for the coronavirus.”On the Defense Production ActWhen: Friday March 20The claim: Trump twice said during a task-force briefing that he had invoked the Defense Production Act a Korean War–era law that enables the federal government to order private industry to produce certain items and materials for national use. He also said the federal government was already using its authority under the law: “We have a lot of people working very hard to do ventilators and various other things.”The truth: Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Peter Gaynor told CNN on March 22 that the president has not actually used the DPA to order private companies to produce anything. Shortly after that Trump backtracked saying that he had not compelled private companies to take action. Then on March 24 Gaynor told CNN that FEMA plans to use the DPA to allocate 60000 test kits. Trump tweeted afterward that the DPA would not be used.When: Saturday March 21The claim: Automobile companies that have volunteered to manufacture medical equipment such as ventilators are “making them right now.”The truth: Ford and General Motors which Trump mentioned at a task-force briefing the same day announced earlier in March that they had halted all factory production in North America and were likely months away from beginning production of ventilators representatives told the Associated Press. Since then Ford CEO James Hackett told CNN that the auto company will begin to work with 3M to produce respirators and with General Electric to assemble ventilators. GM said it will explore the possibility of producing ventilators in an Indiana factory. Tesla CEO Elon Musk whose company Trump highlighted in a tweet has said that the company is “working on ventilators” but that they cannot be produced “instantly.”On States’ ResourcesWhen: Tuesday March 24The claim: Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York passed on an opportunity to purchase 16000 ventilators at a low cost in 2015 Trump said during the Fox News town hall.The truth: Trump seems to have gleaned this claim from a Gateway Pundit article. That piece in turn cites a syndicated column from Betsy McCaughey a former lieutenant governor of New York which includes a figure close to 16000. The number comes from a 2015 report from the state’s health department that provided guidance for how New York could handle a possible flu pandemic. The report notes that the state would need 15783 more ventilators than it had at the time to aid patients during “an influenza pandemic on the scale of the 1918 pandemic.” The report does not include a recommendation to Cuomo for additional purchases or stockpiling. Trump “obviously didn’t read the document he’s citing” a Cuomo representative said in a statement.Another claim: Trump also repeated a claim from the Gateway Pundit article that Cuomo’s office established “death panels” and “lotteries” as part of the state’s pandemic response.The truth: The 2015 report and the accompanying press release announced updated guidelines for hospitals to follow to allocate ventilators. The guidelines “call for a triage officer or triage committee to determine who receives or continues to receive ventilator therapy” and describes how a random lottery allocation might work. (Neither should be the first options for deciding care the report notes.) Cuomo never established a lottery.
95,Trump Is on a Collision Course,PETER NICHOLAS,The Atlantic,-1,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/trump-allies-warn-against-quick-government-reopening/608674/,Senator Lindsey Graham called President Donald Trump this morning to confer about the massive stimulus bill nearing passage on Capitol Hill. But when Trump said that Democrats had “overplayed their hand” Graham offered some advice.“Don’t you do the same thing” he told his occasional golfing buddy.Graham worries that the president will move too hastily to try to reboot the virus-stricken economy—loosening social-isolation measures and thereby triggering more disease and death. “He has a predisposition that the cure is worse than the disease” Graham told me. Should Trump repudiate public-health experts’ advice and take steps that cause infections to spike he would “own” the fallout he said. “Any increase in the mortality rate would be a huge problem for him. The biggest political risk any president takes is deviating from sound advice. The economy can recover. Once a person is dead that’s it.”Trump’s reflex is to salvage economic gains that until a month ago were the basis of his reelection argument. “I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter” on April 12 the president said at a Fox News town hall today. But on this front Graham told me he needs to show restraint—to make a “data-driven decision but err on the side of human life.”MORE STORIESRed and Blue America Aren’t Experiencing the Same PandemicRONALD BROWNSTEINDonald TrumpTrump Is Inciting a Coronavirus Culture War to Save HimselfADAM SERWERAn illustration of Senator Rand Paul spreading coronavirus through the Capitol.Rand Paul Has More Than a ColdEDWARD-ISAAC DOVEREIn the coming days Trump is heading toward a collision—and not just with the medical community and state and local officials worried that aggressive moves to limit the virus’s spread might all be undone.He could also antagonize some of his strongest Republican allies such as Graham who are already sending him warnings. “There will be no normally functioning economy if our hospitals are overwhelmed and thousands of Americans of all ages including our doctors and nurses lay dying because we have failed to do what’s necessary to stop the virus” Representative Liz Cheney a Wyoming Republican tweeted today. She was responding to public comments made by Scott Gottlieb Trump’s former head of the Food and Drug Administration who had warned that the economy can’t function amid “uncontrolled” spread of COVID-19 in large cities. Senator Tom Cotton an Arkansas Republican who is also close to Trump cited Gottlieb’s comments too adding that the United States has to stop the coronavirus’s spread in order “to get the economy back on its feet.”Advice is flooding into the White House from all directions—economists and medical professionals struggling businesspeople and governors. A debate over how the federal government should proceed is still unfolding but Trump’s predilection seems clear: He wants people back to work. “We all realize we have to get moving again” said a senior White House official who like others I talked with for this story spoke on the condition of anonymity.Just days ago at the White House the voice of public-health experts seemed ascendant. Anthony Fauci the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who has advised six different presidents told me that Trump has never overruled a recommendation he’s made. But there’s no guarantee that Fauci’s influence endures. One person close to Trump told me the president was never entirely comfortable with the broad-based stay-at-home recommendations that touched off the economic tailspin. Trump has always solicited advice widely and economic conservatives have delivered a contrarian message to what the president is hearing from the medical community.Stephen Moore a former Trump-campaign adviser whom the president last year considered for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board told me he has spoken with White House officials about what he called the “cascading” economic costs of keeping much of the nation sequestered at home. “The public-health people their view is that any cost is worth bearing. But even from a public-health standpoint what about putting 35 million people out of their jobs?” Moore said. “It will cause death more suicides more drug overdoses and depression and heart attacks.”Larry Kudlow the president’s top economic adviser was asked about the trade-off between an economic rebound and public health in a gaggle with reporters today. “I think that public health includes economic health” Kudlow said. “That’s the key point: It’s not either/or.”When I asked Graham about the advice coming from economic conservatives he said “They don’t have to stand for elections.” His hope is that the approximately $2 trillion economic-stimulus package Congress is weighing could lessen the urgency of reopening the economy in ways that risk more illness. Emergency aid that keeps businesses afloat and stems layoffs could buy time keeping people home and preventing the disease from spreading.Graham who represents South Carolina has played a role in getting the bill passed. He told me he got a phone call this morning from Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who told him that a tweet from Trump signaling that the negotiations need to end would be helpful in prodding lawmakers to pass the package. So Graham said he phoned Trump and told him a tweet would “go a long way.” At 8:45 a.m. ET Trump’s tweet appeared. “Congress must approve the deal without all the nonsense today” he wrote.Reports this morning that lawmakers are poised to strike a deal gave the markets a jolt. By the time the markets closed the Dow Jones Industrial Average had climbed by 11 percent. Still virtually all the gains under Trump have been erased during the month-long sell-off. And unemployment claims have soared; some analysts predict that the country could sink into a depression.For the past three years the strong economy was a core reason Trump said voters should reelect him. Should illness spread because he was too eager to reopen the economy a spike in the Dow may only remind Americans of the human toll.“If his judgment is seen as having extended the disease—and taking the foot off the throat of the disease—at a time when we’re making progress then yeah it would put him in great jeopardy” Graham told me. He suggested an alternative message for the campaign: “I’m the guy who got [the economy] humming. I’m the guy who rebuilt it out of the ashes. My goal is to defeat the virus and I will rebuild this economy. I’ve done it once. I’ll do it again.”
96,Rand Paul Has More Than a Cold,EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE,The Atlantic,-1,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/rand-paul-coronavirus-test-reckless/608593/,By inadvertently spreading the coronavirus around the U.S. Capitol for at least a week Rand Paul has turned the world’s greatest deliberative body into the nation’s highest-profile vector for the spread of the pandemic.The senator from Kentucky was worried enough about being exposed to the virus that he got a still-hard-to-obtain test for it. But while he was waiting for the results he decided to keep showing up to the Senate. He went to group lunches with his Republican colleagues took the Capitol elevators talked with reporters and worked out in the somehow-still-open Senate gym. Yesterday morning he was doing laps in the pool there.By yesterday afternoon Paul had announced that he had tested positive. Graciously he said that he would start self-quarantining.Paul is exactly what we’ve been told to worry about. For all the laughing and hate-tweeting directed at spring breakers saying they don’t think the coronavirus is a big deal they’re at worst dumb selfish underinformed 20-somethings. Paul is a medical doctor (he worked as an ophthalmologist before first being elected in 2012). He is a senator. He is an elected official. People look to him for leadership.In the Senate the average age is 62.9. There are five senators in their 80s—and there will soon be six when Vermont’s Patrick Leahy has his birthday at the end of the month. There are mothers and fathers of young children in the chamber. There are senators who have close family members with conditions that make them especially susceptible to the virus such as Utah’s Mitt Romney whose wife has MS.Then there is Paul whose office claims that he was being extra careful by deciding to get tested (he had a procedure last year to remove a damaged part of his lung) and that he “only got tested because of his insistence.” But Paul’s attitude seems to have boiled down to some version of Too bad for you if I’m infected and I come into contact with you.He is infected. He came into contact with a lot of people. And now at a crucial moment in American history when the entire country is counting on Washington’s response Paul has single-handedly given senators reason to worry that they are risking their health by showing up to vote.None of this explains how Paul got tested at all. People across the country are having trouble breathing and running fevers but being told that they have to wait for a test. Paul was asymptomatic but did attend an art-museum fundraiser in Kentucky on March 7 with two people who later tested positive for COVID-19 (Paul says he never interacted with either of the people in question). Other people at the event including the local mayor have tested positive and Paul seems to have decided that attending the fundraiser was enough reason to ask for a test. How he jumped the line for one is a mystery. America doesn’t have anywhere near enough tests for those who need them despite Donald Trump saying at the beginning of the month that anyone who wanted a test could get one and Vice President Mike Pence saying on March 10 that there would be an additional 4 million tests “before the end of this week.” That was two weeks ago today.Importantly Paul has no idea where or from whom he contracted the virus. He could have gotten it and then spread it at all sorts of places he hasn’t considered.  Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky who was at the same museum fundraiser announced on March 15 that he’d taken a test and the results had come back negative. Still Yarmuth tweeted “I plan to continue working from home and will avoid going out in order to do my part as we all work to practice safe and precautionary distancing to help defeat this pandemic.”Other senators including Ted Cruz of Texas preemptively self-quarantined after learning that they could have been exposed. Cruz had no symptoms either. Paul’s office argued that he got the test “out of an abundance of caution due to his extensive travel and events.” But if traveling between Kentucky and Washington is all that is required to get a test a lot more people should be able to receive immediate testing.They can’t of course. There’s no question that Paul got special treatment. He got a test that others want and can’t get and he got it despite having no symptoms—something the president has explicitly said people shouldn’t be doing. He got it as a United States senator which means that he got it on a taxpayer-funded government health-care plan. Everyone else including those who might be fighting for a ventilator in the coming weeks can wait.All last week while he was deciding that he wanted to be tested getting that specially obtained test and waiting for the results Paul was at work in the Senate. He was holding up then voting against then blasting in a floor speech the first major coronavirus-response bill which includes a provision to make testing once it becomes more readily available free for whoever wants it.Paul got a test that he voted against everyone else being able to get. He slowed the passage of the bill to make a principled stand against the enormous deficit spending involved. He did not mention as he criticized young people for not taking the virus seriously while in almost the next sentence raising doubts that it is worse than the swine flu that he was concerned enough about himself to get tested. “Modern man has become accustomed to the idea that life is relatively safe that a long life is to be expected. Consequently any re-eruption of diseases beyond our control paralyzes us with fear” he said urging people to get their worries under control. He mentioned that his parents remember the polio scares and that they lived through those well into their 80s.One of those parents is Ron Paul the former congressman from Texas and presidential candidate who helped mainstream a version of libertarianism that his son is clearly inspired by though the elder Paul is a separate political figure and not formally affiliated with his son except by biology. But here’s what Ron Paul who also began his professional life as a doctor (an obstetrician) wrote in a commentary published on March 16: “People should ask themselves whether this coronavirus ‘pandemic’ could be a big hoax with the actual danger of the disease massively exaggerated by those who seek to profit—financially or politically—from the ensuing panic.” The same day Rand Paul’s chief political strategist Doug Stafford tweeted mockingly about New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio taking a midday break from dealing with the pandemic response to go to a gym in Brooklyn: “So people can’t eat out but can go to the gym where they expel bodily fluid and touch things other people just touched. Ok.” His boss he would later find out was doing those things all week.Here are some of the questions I sent Paul’s spokesman this morning:When did the senator decide to get tested? Why did he wait when Congressman Yarmuth who was at that same museum fundraiser got tested a week earlier?Why did he not inform anyone in the Senate that he was concerned enough to get tested and/or self-quarantine?How did the senator obtain a test so quickly when others have been waiting (including others who likewise have conditions that have them on high alert)?Was the test covered under his Senate health insurance? If not how was it paid for?The only response I received pointed me to the statements that Paul has put out over the past day which don’t address these questions. Paul’s office released an emailed statement from him this afternoon calling for “more testing immediately even among those without symptoms.” He argued “The nature of COVID-19 put me—and us all—in a Catch-22 situation. I didn’t fit the criteria for testing or quarantine. I had no symptoms and no specific encounter with a COVID-19 positive person. I had however traveled extensively in the U.S. and was required to continue doing so to vote in the Senate. That together with the fact that I have a compromised lung led me to seek testing.”He turned his scolding toward anyone questioning how he’s behaved holding himself up as an exemplar because he went out of his way to get tested even though he kept it secret and even though he got a test others can’t get.“For those who want to criticize me for lack of quarantine realize that if the rules on testing had been followed to a tee I would never have been tested and would still be walking around the halls of the Capitol” the statement reads. “Perhaps it is too much to ask that we simply have compassion for our fellow Americans who are sick or fearful of becoming so.”I hope the senator makes a full recovery. Many Americans who are sick or fearful of becoming so won’t get the same compassion or access to treatment that he did.
97,The COVID-19 Crisis Reveals an Old Divide Between the Parties,RONALD BROWNSTEIN,The Atlantic,-1,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/what-covid-19-debate-has-common-aca-fight/608797/,How much do the healthiest people in society owe to the most vulnerable?That question—about Americans’ capacity for shared sacrifice—was at the core of the struggle over repealing the Affordable Care Act during the first months of Donald Trump’s presidency. Now it’s resurfacing in the escalating partisan debate over responding to the coronavirus crisis.In designing the ACA then-President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats put a premium on policies that encouraged more sharing of medical and financial risk among those with greater and fewer health needs such as requiring insurers to guarantee coverage to consumers with preexisting conditions. During the repeal fight in 2017 Trump and congressional Republicans condemned those same efforts arguing that the law required the young and healthy to sacrifice too much to reduce the risk to the old and sick.A similar divergence is emerging as the country grapples with the social and economic strain of containing the rapidly intensifying outbreak. In his public comments this week Trump—amplifying a chorus of conservative economists elected officials and media figures—has effectively argued that shutting down the economy is imposing financial pain on more people than can be justified by the number of lives the restrictions will save. Democratic governors such as New York’s Andrew Cuomo counter that the broader society has an obligation to save as many of the most vulnerable as it can whatever the pain to the many. “Job one has to be to save lives” Cuomo declared in a video he released Tuesday. “We are going to fight every way we can to save every life that we can.”These contrasting perspectives place the parties in the same position they were in not only during the recent attempts at repeal but also during the initial debate over passing the ACA in 2009. “It absolutely is a parallel there” says Sabrina Corlette a research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. “It’s very much about the social compact and how much cost do I have to incur to help my neighbor who may be in greater need than I am?”The geographic distribution of the disease in its early stages reinforces the parties’ philosophical split over the basic question Corlette raises. So far in the United States the disease has primarily clustered in large metropolitan areas with New York City Seattle San Francisco Los Angeles New Orleans Chicago Miami Boston and Detroit among the places bearing the heaviest brunt of the outbreak. In every state voters in and around cities have become the Democratic Party’s foundation.By contrast the disease has made significantly fewer inroads in small-town and rural communities that have become the central pillars of the GOP coalition especially under Trump. That disparate level of exposure means that many Republican-leaning areas feel the effect of the response to the disease more than they do that of the disease itself notes Larry Levitt the executive vice president for health policy at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. And that makes such places a receptive audience for Trump’s argument that the cure cannot be worse than the problem. “At this moment the economic crisis is much more visible in redder parts of the country while the health crisis is more visible in bluer parts of the country” Levitt says.This conflict is unfolding most tangibly in several of the nation’s largest Republican-leaning states. In Florida Georgia Texas and Missouri for example local officials in big Democratic-leaning cities (such as Miami Atlanta Dallas and St. Louis) have moved to severely restrict activity. But those mayors have complained that their efforts are being undercut by the refusal of Republican governors—whose support is typically greatest in rural areas—to impose uniform limits across the state.This tension may preview the larger collision coming if Trump supported by an array of conservative leaders moves forward on his calls to begin lifting limits on Americans’ behavior an action most Democrats and many public-health officials resist as dangerously premature.How to apportion risk across society is an issue that underpins many of the most pointed conflicts between the parties even if it is rarely discussed explicitly. As I wrote in 2017 promoting the sharing of risk between the healthy and the sick was a preeminent goal of the ACA. Before the law people with significant health needs were either charged much higher premiums for coverage in the individual-insurance market or denied coverage altogether because they had a preexisting condition. Those rules benefited healthier people buying individual coverage: Because those with greater needs were systematically excluded insurers had to pay out fewer claims allowing them to hold down premiums for everyone else.The ACA upended that arrangement. Through a long list of reforms it required insurers to sell coverage at comparable prices to those with greater and lesser health needs—a policy known as “community rating.” It asked the young and healthy to pay more for coverage so that it would be affordable and available for older and sicker consumers.The widespread lockdowns now being implemented to contain the spread of the coronavirus rest on the same underlying principle. In even the most adverse scenarios most Americans will not be seriously sickened or killed by the disease. That means the nation is now imposing costs on many people who are less likely to die of the coronavirus in order to reduce the risk for those who are the most vulnerable.“The discussion we are having now about the coronavirus epidemic is community rating writ large” Levitt says. “It’s about making a sacrifice in order to protect people who are old or have a preexisting condition and therefore have a higher risk.”During the ACA-repeal fight the Republican alternatives to the law all sought to reduce premiums by unraveling parts of the law related to greater risk sharing. Since the repeal effort failed the Trump administration has continued to pursue that vision through regulatory measures. For instance it has allowed the sale of more short-term insurance plans which provide fewer benefits at lower cost and lure healthy consumers away from shared-risk pools with the sick.“A critical difference between the parties” is this Corlette says: Democrats believe that “the healthy should subsidize the sick—the young the old—because we all get older and sicker at some point in our lives.“On the flip side” she continued “if you look at what’s underpinning many of the more conservative health-reform ideas … [it’s that] what people pay toward their insurance or their care should reflect their level of risk.”That perspective applied to the coronavirus outbreak means that individuals or regions that are at less risk can be asked to sacrifice only so much to protect those at greater risk. Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick expressed perhaps the most extreme version of that thinking this week when he argued on Fox News that older Americans would accept a greater danger of dying from the disease if it allowed the economy and the broader society to reopen sooner.Trump and other conservatives are marching toward that same policy conclusion even if they are using less incendiary language. Down one front they argue that shutting down the economy carries its own health dangers because a sustained economic slowdown will seed more suicides alcohol and drug abuse and domestic violence. And down another they insist that government always must balance the cost of saving lives against the economic consequences of its decisions.Stephen Moore a former economic adviser to Trump and one of the most vocal proponents of reopening the country notes that the federal government already puts a price on life when it evaluates the costs and benefits of environmental or occupational health regulations. The same logic should apply to the outbreak. “There are costs to all of these things” he told me. “The idea that we are going to keep the economy closed for seven or 10 or 12 weeks or more is untenable.”Moore acknowledged that evaluating the costs and benefits isn’t easy because the failure to quickly develop and deploy testing has left America blind to how many cases it’s now facing—and thus uncertain about how many deaths it might confront from loosening restrictions sooner rather than later. (“We are shooting in the dark here” he conceded.) But he argued under any scenario there must be some balancing of economic and public-health costs. While it might be a natural instinct “to destroy the economy of New York City to save a few hundred lives” Moore insisted “that’s not necessarily the right decision because you have 7 million people who are going to be severely hurt.”The biggest paradox in the health-care fight was that the Republican efforts to unravel risk-sharing hurt the material interests of their electoral coalition. The reason is that all their plans raised costs on older people with greater health needs at the same time as their base was becoming older and whiter. Their plans lowered prices for younger people who now lean reliably toward the Democrats.In some ways the effects of quickly reopening the country might not follow partisan lines as consistently. Demographically it might benefit some Democratic-leaning constituencies (low-wage workers of color vulnerable to a sustained economic shutdown for instance) and imperil some Republican-leaning ones (such as seniors). But the geographic implications are much more straightforward with the outbreak so far concentrated in Democratic-leaning major metro areas not Republican-leaning regions. If the disease was now ravaging small-town America it’s unlikely that Trump and so many other conservatives would be as enthusiastic about easing social distancing.The reprieve may be temporary: Most experts believe it is only a matter of time until the disease reaches throughout the nation. “This is going to continue to roll out over the country over the next months” Michael Osterholm the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota told me. “You would expect the metropolitan areas … that have the most international travel to be where the virus is first introduced. But that then is just a seeding event for areas around the country.”The likelihood that the disease will steadily advance beyond its beachheads raises the final parallel to the ACA fight.The law’s proponents believed it was in the self-interest of the young to pay more to ensure coverage for the old because the former hope to eventually become the latter. Conservatives now questioning whether they are paying too great an economic cost are in fact in the same position as young people under the ACA. They are prepaying on measures designed to better contain the disease before it comes to the smaller places Republicans rely on.It’s not too surprising to see Trump and other Republicans bridle against social distancing: Their complaints fit with the right’s long-standing unease about any policy that shares risk by imposing costs broadly. The entrenched power of that belief is why Corlette is pessimistic the country will preserve widespread limits on activity while the disease remains concentrated in relatively few places. “I have zero optimism we will be able to sustain that” she says. “It may be sustained in pockets of the country certain states or certain cities. But it’s hard to see this nationwide for much longer. As a country we are not great at embracing the social contract.”The growing recoil on the right from social distancing suggests that she’s correct. Unless and until the disease widely disperses it’s not hard to imagine Trump and other conservatives eventually describing the disease as just a problem of big cities the way they’ve already labeled it as the “Chinese virus.” Loosening rules on activity while criticizing the places where the disease is still raging might prove an effective near-term strategy for rallying Trump’s political base. But in terms of protecting public health abandoning a common front against the disease may prove the riskiest course—including for the smaller communities yet to feel its bite.
98,The Biggest Worry for Doctors Fighting the Pandemic,MIKE GIGLIO,The Atlantic,-1,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-doctor-family-test/608509/,One family. Six doctors.Yvonne Yui is waiting for the results of a coronavirus test after potentially being exposed at the East Coast hospital where she practices neonatal medicine. Her cousin Pamela Lin a physician at a family practice in Baltimore has been coughing for three days as she awaits her own test results.Lin’s husband is an infectious-disease expert managing the coronavirus response at a Baltimore hospital fretting about shortages in protective gear and supplies. Within this tight-knit extended family is also an emergency-room doctor dealing with an uptick in patients with symptoms associated with the coronavirus a doctor in Philadelphia who treats immunocompromised patients who are especially vulnerable to the virus and a retired doctor who may well be called in to care for the sick as cases rise exponentially.Yui had always counted herself lucky to be among a family of doctors. Now the family is facing the greatest challenge of their lives as they wrestle with the dilemma of caring for their patients even though this risks exposing their loved ones. Suddenly she’s confronted with impossible questions: Who in the family would care for her infant daughter if she does fall ill? What should she advise her elderly mother to do if she’s called on to care for coronavirus patients? Will her family survive the crisis intact? “I think about it pretty much all the time” she told me.Doctors across America are facing similar predicaments made all the more acute by the government’s failure to protect them—to warn the public to provide tests and to supply enough protective equipment. And every time a doctor falls ill a health-care system that is already strained edges closer to its breaking point.Yui 33 thought of her family as she was tested for the virus: her five-month-old daughter; her mother who lives nearby to help with child care; and her husband who has asthma putting him at greater risk from COVID-19 the disease associated with the coronavirus. (She has not experienced symptoms.) “When it comes to us being doctors I worry about [family members] Stephanie and Alex and Jennifer and Pam—about their health and about the eventual burnout due to everything that’s going on” Yvonne told me. “There’s the emotional toll of the work and then there’s the worry we have about each other.”When I reached Yvonne’s cousin Pamela by phone on Thursday night our conversation was interspersed with her regular coughing.As a primary-care physician she’s the first point of contact with the medical system for many patients. Last week one came in complaining of difficulty breathing a common symptom of the coronavirus. As that patient’s breathing worsened Pam recommended a hospital visit to be tested. “It was already too late for me and my family” Pamela told me—she had been potentially exposed. Her patient got tested on March 12 and is still waiting for results. “My patient’s test was sent from Baltimore to a lab in Utah then due to a reagent shortage [a substance needed to process the tests] sent from Utah to Arizona Arizona back to a lab in North Carolina” she said. This is a mirror of the dysfunction and delays surrounding the country’s testing crisis a major factor hamstringing the fight against the virus.Meanwhile she started feeling sick on Tuesday and took the test herself. Self-quarantined at home she thinks it’s only a matter of time if she does have the virus before she infects her two children—totally isolating from them would be all but impossible. On top of that she’s pained about missing work. “As a health-care provider if I test positive it has big implications for my office my staff and all the patients” she told me. “There’s also this obligation that my co-workers and I feel: ‘If I’m well enough I should go to work.’ I have a mission. It makes it really hard for any of us to sit on the sidelines.”Her husband Alexander Chen the infectious-disease expert told me that compared with many hospitals across the country his is well off. It’s equipped with extra masks and emergency ventilators. Yet even this surplus he warned could quickly run out in the expected surge of patients. So could a range of other items—thermometer covers protective gowns and material for the transport of testing kits. Hospitals around the country are cautioning that they face drastic shortages in everything from ventilators and protective equipment to swabs needed to perform tests. “The feeling I have is frustration” Alexander said. “We’re at this point where we’re going into conservation mode [even before the crisis hits]. And then it’s just waiting for the inevitable.”He admitted that the outlook for medical professionals could become bleak. “I kind of came to terms last night with the fact that we may see doctors and nurses and respiratory therapists die” he told me. “And I am just trying to accept that bad things will happen so I’m not surprised.”Emergency-room doctors he noted are among those most at risk.Stephanie Anderson a cousin to Yvonne and Pamela holds that job at a hospital in Richmond Virginia. She told me she worries about bringing the virus home to her husband and two children ages 7 and 9. She keeps her distance from them until she has showered and put her clothes in the wash after she gets home from each shift. Then she disinfects her car. “I have a family that I’m coming home to. And I have to keep them safe” she told me. “That’s been the concern among my colleagues: What are you going to do with your family? It’s on all of our minds. It’s certainly adding to our stress.”Her emergency room has been seeing more and more patients who have symptoms associated with the coronavirus she told me. She wears protective equipment but knows that the hospital could run out. Even if that happens though she’ll keep working: “For those of us in ER we just know that’s what we signed up for. You work in mass-casualty events. You work in serious trauma. You just work.”Anna Koo Yvonne’s mother and the family’s eldest doctor at 68 expressed a similar mindset. In Britain the government has asked for 65000 doctors and nurses to come out of retirement to help manage the pandemic. In the United States the Department of Veterans Affairs and New York City have made similar requests. People over the age of 65 are at increased risk from the coronavirus but Anna told me she’d consider signing up. “If I’m needed and people think I can help then definitely” she said. “You know we’re all in this. Everybody’s got to do their part.”It’s not lost on Koo and her family that medical professionals worldwide have been dying fighting the coronavirus. On Wednesday a prominent doctor who’d been treating patients in northern Italy died alone in an intensive-care unit after contracting it. He was 57. Because of shortages similar to what U.S. doctors are predicting he’d been forced to continue working after running out of gloves. Doctors and nurses in their 20s and 30s have succumbed to the virus in China. The most famous victim Li Wenliang the Wuhan doctor who’d tried to issue early warnings about the pandemic was 34.But in my conversations with Yui and her family I realized that the main dilemma they’re grappling with is not so much getting sick themselves but spreading the virus to their families their patients and the public. This might be the greatest fear of doctors across the country—that they’ll move from being part of the solution to part of the problem. “I think we all feel a really strong sense of duty to our patients and our work” Jennifer Yui Yvonne’s sister a doctor who works with immunocompromised patients in Philadelphia told me. “And that could lead to people working beyond when they should. It weighs heavily on people.”Yui for her part told me she’d never let her fears about the virus stop her from doing her job. She expects to get her test result on Monday. If it’s negative she’ll be back at work the same night. “I view myself as essential personnel. So it’s that sense of duty I guess” she said. “I have never thought of not going to work. We go in to take care of our patients through all sorts of natural disasters—and that is when we are needed the most.”
99,Arnold Schwarzenegger Plays Hero One More Time,EDWARD-ISAAC DOVERE,The Atlantic,-1,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/arnold-schwarzenegger-coronavirus-videos/608581/,What you haven’t been weathering self-quarantine by feeding carrots to your mini-horse and mini-donkey or smoking cigars in your hot tub?Arnold Schwarzenegger—bodybuilding champion actor California governor and now the star of PSAs urging people to stay home—is keeping busy doing just that. It’s one way to pass the time between working out a new partnership with TikTok to transform his decades-old afterschool program into a meals provider for children out of school and donating $1 million to buy masks for nurses and doctors who need them.He doesn’t have much choice. He’s still Arnold Schwarzenegger he still looks like Arnold Schwarzenegger (well with reading glasses and a beard) and he certainly still sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger. But he’s also a 72-year-old man who had emergency heart surgery in 2018 and who loves to ride his bicycle around but has been keeping clear of crowds for weeks.He knows that his home in Los Angeles has a lot more to it than most homes between the stable and the hot tub and the private gym and the outdoor fireplace. But he’s been holed up watching Outbreak and Contagion too. (Outbreak he says is very entertaining but “Contagion is really exactly what is going on right now.”) He also just watched The Great Ziegfeld. That one is from 1936 a song-and-dance adaptation of The Ziegfeld Follies with Myrna Loy and William Powell. It was a nice change of pace.Over Zoom the other night about an hour after he got out of the hot tub—by then he’d dried off and put on a Terminator: Dark Fate T-shirt—I asked him if maybe the movies we should be thinking about more are from his own catalog. Does he think we are in the prelude to Terminator?“I mean not now” he told me. “But look I still think that if everyone stays with the program and stays more isolated and away from other people we can overcome this with a five rather than a 10.”You can listen to our conversation in a bonus episode of The Ticket: Politics from The Atlantic up now:You’ve watched Schwarzenegger blow up all kinds of things on-screen using all kinds of things. What you probably don’t know is that in real life he’s obsessed with disaster preparedness—and that while he’s mugging with his mini-horse and mini-donkey or pulling up the latest documentary his kids have recommended what he really wants is to be in charge. A decade after finishing up as governor he’s sitting at home watching the action on TV and wishing he could be showing up at hospitals and other sites to solve problems and break down bureaucratic hold-ups even if that would mean arriving in a full protective suit. “You’re treated differently if you walk around” he reasoned. He wants to be ordering drills to test readiness for massive patient influxes. He wants to be the one cutting through the delays in getting more beds and masks. He told me about finding out that a company had 22000 spare cots for use in a wildfire emergency which the state couldn’t access because the ownership had changed and switched the locks and no one could track down who had the passcode. He went off on a tangent about how so many hospitals have gotten waivers on earthquake-proofing that he knows California is not ready for a big one. These are the kinds of situations in which the man who played Conan the Barbarian the Terminator and John Kimble wants to be let loose.“There are moments and especially moments like this where I feel like oh that would be really great to be there now” Schwarzenegger told me.  Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York has become a pandemic-response star in the past two weeks applying his usual Machiavellian power moves to deal with the disaster. President Donald Trump continues to pick petty fights from the White House podium interspersing false promises and hunch-based “science” with temper tantrums. Joe Biden has basically disappeared from view doing what he says are hours of calls each day with advisers and slowly setting up a press-briefing area in the rec room of his Wilmington Delaware home. Meanwhile Schwarzenegger has been riffing for his millions of social-media followers (he calls his playful absurdist jokes “Arnold-isms”) hoping to break through to the people who have heard all the warnings from government and public-health officials but are still going to places like the Florida beaches and the Washington D.C. cherry blossoms. “People enjoy that it’s unscripted when I do those messages. It’s not reading off a teleprompter or anything. I don’t do the political kind of stuff. I just say what my concerns are” he said.Is Schwarzenegger a little ridiculous sometimes? Of course he’s a little ridiculous sometimes. He revels in being a little ridiculous sometimes. But he’s also perhaps the most famous climate-change activist regularly traveling the world and meeting with heads of state and other international players.That’s why he told me he wasn’t surprised to see a pandemic break out. Experts at the World Health Organization he said have been telling him for a while about their fears of a virus. He said the first stories out of China caught his attention right away. “I said to myself I think this is ... the virus that they were worried about.”He can’t believe that the president and other officials didn’t have the same realization. He’s mad that so much of the public’s attention has strayed from questions about the supply and production of masks and ventilators. He’s frustrated that the stockpiles are so low. He gets angry talking about people ignoring “the curve.” “There is no more time of waiting” he said. “We know the writing on the wall.”Schwarzenegger often talks about how he got his first taste of being in charge: After California’s 2003 recall election he went to view wildfire damage with Gray Davis the man he’d just beaten who was heavy on government experience but short on charisma. A few years in he was all about fire management and disaster preparedness spending billions of dollars to upgrade the state’s levees and setting up disaster drills then starting them two hours ahead of schedule to make sure no one got too comfortable.“They laughed about it and brushed it off until of course Katrina happened” he said. “After Katrina happened they came back to me and they said ‘What was that again that you talked about?’ They called me alarmist then and they said ‘We're just recovering from a recession. Well why would you spend $6.4 billion on levees when we need the money for other things and blah blah blah.’”So he’s willing to accept that Trump and others came into office not appreciating what they had to do. He’s not willing to accept that years into the job they still didn’t know. He’s willing to accept that the response to the coronavirus is unprecedented in the history of the planet. He’s not willing to accept that in 2011 the year after he left office state budget cuts eliminated a $1.7 million fund dedicated to building a 200-bed hospital in three days during an emergency.Thanks to Trump Schwarzenegger has had a weird few years politically. First he seemed to be the model that inspired Trump to enter politics. Then he wouldn’t support Trump as the Republican nominee in 2016. Then he replaced Trump as the host of Celebrity Apprentice. Then Trump started taking potshots at his ratings at the National Prayer Breakfast. Then Schwarzenegger became the black sheep of the Republican Party hounded by reporters trying to get him to take a shot at Trump. Often he did.Suddenly he’s once again above the usual politics. “A unique PSA” Senator Ted Cruz tweeted from his own self-quarantine in Texas last week. “Schwarzenegger in his kitchen wearing a Terminator t-shirt giving coronavirus advice—stay home if you don’t need to go out—while feeding a pony called Whiskey & a donkey called Lulu.” Charlotte Clymer a communications aide for the Human Rights Campaign joked back on Twitter “I don’t believe you Governor. We’re going to need to see more of these videos to be convinced.” Schwarzenegger has complied. On Friday he posted a clip of him feeding Whiskey asparagus off his plate. That one got 124000 likes.Arnold Schwarzenegger is back.“All I'm caring about is: What can I do to help people?” he told me. “There’s people still living in denial. And I think that there’s also some people that you know they even see a crisis like this through a political lens. That’s what holds us back. I mean for anyone to say ‘This is not dangerous; it’s just another virus and other viruses kill much more people than this virus does’ and all this stuff—this is nonsense dialogue. It doesn’t help anybody.”Listen to him if you want to live.
100,Anthony Fauci’s Plan to Stay Honest,PETER NICHOLAS,The Atlantic,-1,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/anthony-fauci-covid-19-trump-and-staying-healthy/608554/,When Anthony Fauci returned my call the other day he was standing outside the West Wing on his way to a meeting of the coronavirus task force. He didn’t have much time to talk; he had 20 more phone calls to make he told me. Getting a chair at the task-force meetings isn’t guaranteed. Even in the White House Situation Room officials practice social distancing.When Vice President Mike Pence arrives at the sessions he checks to see whether people are squeezed too close together putting one another at risk of infection. If they are he “essentially kicks people out of the room saying ‘Hey go to another room and tune in by teleconference’” Fauci told me.Many Americans seem to want Fauci to be in the room where decisions are being made. His candor has made him an instant icon. During White House press briefings social-media users dissect his second-by-second facial expressions for clues as to what he’s thinking when President Donald Trump takes questions. Alarm spread among TV viewers when he missed a briefing the other day giving rise to the hash tag #WheresFauci.Whether he’s allowed to stay in the room and for how long is anyone’s guess. Trump doesn’t like to be upstaged. And speaking truths that clash with Trump’s message risks banishment and ridicule from the president. The 79-year-old Fauci who is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has shown that he’s willing to do it anyway. As Trump touts an existing malaria drug as a potential treatment (“I’m probably more of a fan of that—maybe than anybody” he said at a press briefing Friday) Fauci made plain that the drug’s effectiveness against the coronavirus is unproven.No. The answer is no” Fauci who was standing alongside Trump said in response to a question about whether any evidence indicates that the drug might work. What evidence there is he said remains “anecdotal.”Fauci has advised six presidents since he became the head of NIAID in 1984. But he’s never seen a disease quite like COVID-19 nor has he ever worked for a president quite like Trump. Our conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity.Peter Nicholas: In your long career have you ever seen a public-health crisis in the U.S. as serious as this one?Anthony Fauci: No. What we have right now is something that’s very different and very acute and very threatening. And the reason people are getting anxiety about it—in some respects appropriately so—is because it seems that no one is safe from this. It’s a diffuse respiratory illness that has a high degree of morbidity and mortality particularly among certain vulnerable populations like the elderly and those with underlying conditions. This is unprecedented. I’ve been doing this a long time and I’ve never seen anything like this.Take the clock back a decade or so. [You could have said] We have 12700 ventilators in the strategic national stockpile. Why not put 100000 in there? There would not have been any enthusiasm on anybody’s part to spend that much money to do that. Now retrospectively when you look back you say Oh my God why didn’t we put 100000 ventilators in there?It’s a dynamic situation and people understandably want to know: Do we have enough? We don’t know. As more people require care and equipment the system is stressed. So we have to do the best we possibly can. Hopefully that will be enough.Nicholas: Have you felt pressure from the Trump administration to deliver a particular message about the coronavirus?Fauci: No they’ve not [pressured me]. [Laughs.] I’m not sure why.I made up my mind a long time ago Peter—and this goes back to the first time I had to speak the truth to Ronald Reagan about the seriousness of HIV/AIDS when people were not paying attention to it. I was like the lone wolf out there: This is going to be big. We’ve got to do something about it.I’m doing the same thing now. And my attitude is: I’m going to keep doing that. I don’t think they’re going to try to silence me. I think that would be foolish on their part. And I don’t even think they want to. I think in some respects they welcome my voice out there telling the truth. I’m going to keep doing it. And no matter what happens to me I’m going to keep doing it.Nicholas: How does Trump compare with other presidents with whom you’ve worked?Fauci: He has a very unique style. But the thing that encourages me is that every time I’ve asked him to do something—cut out China travel or go to the mitigation guidelines—he’s always ultimately listened to what I’ve said. When I’ve said I really think we should do this he’s never said no and overruled my recommendation. No matter what his style is when it comes to the core of what gets done thankfully he has listened to me.Nicholas: Are you taking steps to protect yourself and avoid infection?Fauci: As best I can yes. There are risks that some people need to take because when it comes to the public health and the safety of the American people sometimes you really have got to take some risks for yourself. Not everybody can shelter in place. But I try to do my best. I wash my hands 100 times a day. I don’t ever shake hands with anybody. And when I’m talking to somebody I try to stay six feet away from them. So I am doing that. When I am not here [at work]—I’m going about 20 hours a day—I try to do my best.If you go back—and I’ve been doing this for about 36 years starting with the early years of HIV/AIDS—each of the outbreaks has a different flavor to them. Some are scary but the reality is not that bad. Like Ebola—everyone got frightened by Ebola but there really was no chance in the United States that we would have a diffuse outbreak of Ebola because of the way Ebola spreads.Nicholas: Was the U.S. adequately prepared for the pandemic?Fauci: If you have an overwhelming pandemic there’s almost no degree of preparedness that can prevent all the suffering and death. There are relative degrees of preparedness. And in that regard [the U.S. leads] in the level of preparedness. But obviously as you can see [with] what is playing out right now when you have something with the force of a pandemic it appears that you are not well prepared.
101,This Southern County Is Blocking All Visitors — Even Part-Time Residents — During The Coronavirus Pandemic,Dominic Holden,BuzzFeed News,-1,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/dominicholden/coronavirus-southern-counties-closing-borders-visitors,As some Americans flee crowded urban centers like New York City to ride out the coronavirus pandemic rural residents have urged them to stay away. Now at least a few jurisdictions are enacting severe new rules to keep them out.Counties in North Carolina and Florida told BuzzFeed News they will soon set up roadblocks to barricade against visitors unless they have evidence of a home job or other necessity inside the county.The standout is Dare County North Carolina where officials have implemented what may be the strictest ban of its type in the nation: Police have set up roadblocks to stop visitors from entering the coastal beach haven — even people who own vacation homes there.“We have basically two roads leading in and have deputies stationed at checkpoints” Dorothy Hester a spokesperson for Dare County told BuzzFeed News. Officials are granting entry permits to workers full-time residents and those who prove a need to enter. But she said police have been turning away anyone trying to reach the county’s 25000 empty properties used as secondary vacation homes or rentals — violators can be charged with a misdemeanor.“With each of those owners you bring family extended family” said Hester who noted that there’s no expiration date on the ban. “We are just not set up to sustain that especially if we were to get some type of community spread of the coronavirus.”One case of coronavirus had been reported in Dare County population 35000 as of Wednesday evening. With tens of thousands of vacation homes dotting the county’s barrier islands along the Atlantic Ocean visitors can easily outnumber the year-round residents.“Many of our visitors come from New York and Virginia” said Bobby Outten the Dare County manager who noted that Outer Banks Hospital — the only hospital there — has just 20 beds and no intensive care unit.“In the summertime when we have several hundred thousand people and people cut their foot on the beach or get a fish hook in them we can handle that” he said. The county’s southern island is a three-hour drive to Norfolk Virginia which can take in seriously ill patients. “When you talk about coronavirus spreading here we don’t have the capacity to treat them or transfer them” Outten said.Civil liberties advocates have watched travel bans related to the coronavirus cautiously noting that the government can have legitimate reasons to restrict access during emergencies but in general the orders must be temporary.“The constitutional right to travel is really important and turning counties into gated communities is a dangerous precedent” Kristi Graunke legal director of ACLU of North Carolina told BuzzFeed News. “Not that you can’t restrict movement in times of emergency but you have to be conscious of the long-term ramifications.”The coronavirus pandemic has thrust the nation into fresh legal territory: This is the most widespread infringement on civil liberties in the country’s modern history with shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns affecting hundreds of millions of Americans. And yet the government has rarely if ever had such a compelling interest to do so.Outten compared the current travel ban to emergency measures during a hurricane. “When things are safe” he said “you open the county and this is not a lot different than that.”North Carolina emergency law extends particular power for cities and counties to shut down access during crises without the governor’s or legislature’s approval — a useful tool for localities along the often storm-battered Atlantic Coast. A March 17 declaration banning visitors and gatherings due to the coronavirus by the Dare County Control Group which includes county officials and mayors of six towns cited the “unprecedented public health threat.”In similar thinking the island of North Haven Maine passed a resolution to “strongly encourage” visitors to steer clear.In heavily forested Graham County North Carolina three checkpoints are planned for early next week though travelers will be allowed to pass through on at least one highway and visit their vacation homes. County Manager Rebecca Garland told BuzzFeed News the county of 8500 can’t provide medical care: “We have no hope of having a hospital. And so far we have not had a confirmed case of coronavirus but we know it’s coming.”.While there are a few hospitals in the Florida Keys an archipelago connected by a single highway police will create a checkpoint there “by Friday morning for sure” according to Kristen Livengood the spokesperson for Monroe County Florida.Stationed near the top of Florida’s island chain officers will allow entry to residents including people who own secondary homes and those with work — but not visitors who are simply trying to escape the densely populated cities to the north.“Miami-Dade County and Broward County are above us” Livengood said. “They have had an explosion of cases.”She fears those travelers could usurp medical resources in Monroe County which had 12 cases by Thursday morning. “So many people are not working and their kids are not in school so they come to the Keys to enjoy some time off” she said. “And it’s not safe for anyone to be traveling at this point.”Livengood continued: “We speak to the hospitals and urgent care and everyone says they are adequately prepared but we want to make sure if we have an outbreak our residents need the hospitals — that there are enough beds not in addition to the visitors.”Daniel Tilley legal director for the ACLU of Florida said in a statement to BuzzFeed News that governments can restrict travel during an emergency “but they must ensure that any travel restrictions or prohibitions are no more restrictive than necessary. Public officials must also provide adequate notice of the restrictions and provide a hearing process that allows individuals who are impacted by such policies a fair opportunity to explain why they should not be subjected to the policy.”New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy on Twitter this week urged residents not to head to the Jersey Shore. And the New York Times reported that residents of some popular tourist towns are trying to stave off city folk saying the interlopers raid store shelves and bring “bugs.”
102,Planned Parenthood Sued Texas For Banning Nearly All Abortions During The Coronavirus Outbreak,Ema O'Connor,BuzzFeed News,-1,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/emaoconnor/planned-parenthood-lawsuit-texas-abortion-ban-coronavirus,Days after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton ordered a ban on nearly all abortions in the state during the coronavirus pandemic Planned Parenthood filed a emergency lawsuit in federal court attempting to overturn the order.The lawsuit filed Wednesday night on behalf of eight reproductive health clinics in Texas claims that Paxton’s order is unconstitutional and in violation of Roe v. Wade and demands an immediate temporary restraining order to keep the doors of Texas’s abortion clinics open.“It’s unconscionable that the Texas Attorney General is exploiting this pandemic to end abortion in the state” Nancy Northup head of the Center for Reproductive Rights a legal nonprofit joining the lawsuit said in a call with press Wednesday evening. “Abortion care is time-sensitive and essential health care that has a profound impact on a person’s health and life which is why it is protected as a constitutional right.”Texas Gov. Greg Abbott issued an executive order Sunday demanding that any “medically unnecessary surgeries and procedures” be canceled during the coronavirus outbreak through April 21 in order to ensure that all the medical resources possible could be devoted to mitigating and treating patients with COVID-19 the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.Following Abbott’s order his Attorney General’s Office issued a press release explicitly saying that the order applied to “any type of abortion that is not medically necessary to preserve the life of the mother” and that anyone found in violation of the order would “be met with the full force of the law” including a $1000 fine or up to 180 days in jail.“The COVID-19 pandemic has increased demands for hospital beds and has created a shortage of personal protective equipment [PPE] needed to protect health care professionals and stop transmission of the virus” Paxton’s statement read. “Postponing surgeries and procedures that are not immediately medically necessary will ensure that hospital beds are available for those suffering from COVID-19 and that PPEs are available for health care professionals.”Texas is currently the only state to explicitly attempt to ban the procedure during the coronavirus pandemic. Last week Ohio’s deputy attorney general Jonathan Fulkerson sent letters to several abortion clinics in the state accusing them of being in violation of the order but the clinics’ lawyers quickly responded assuring Fulkerson’s office that they were in compliance with the order and were taking all necessary precautions. Abortion clinics in Ohio remain open appointments have not been canceled and so far the clinics are not being penalized.In the lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas the reproductive rights organizations pointed out that Paxton’s phrasing implies that even medication abortion (taking an abortion pill by mouth which can be done at home by telemedicine) which is not surgery or a procedure is banned under his order.“This appears to be the only oral medication targeted in this manner” the lawsuit reads extrapolating that Paxton’s interpretation of Abbott’s order was made with the explicit aim of limiting abortion access even in cases where it would have no effect on medical resources available for treating COVID-19 cases.If the interpretation were to go into effect “patients will not be able to obtain an abortion for weeks or even months given that the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to last far beyond the order’s stated expiration date” the lawsuit states. “Some will not be able to access abortion at all and will be forced to carry pregnancies to term.”If many women in Texas were made to give birth against their will the lawsuit argues the order would not only infringe on their personal freedoms but it would be economically damaging to the state imposing “far greater strains on an already-taxed healthcare system as prenatal care and delivery involve much greater exhaustion of hospital health care services and PPE than abortions.”
103,5 Ways To Protect Our Election During The Coronavirus Pandemic According To A New Bipartisan Election Emergency Task Force,Dominic Holden,BuzzFeed News,-1,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/dominicholden/coronavirus-2020-election-voting-advice,"Dozens of former Republican officials and progressive leaders have banded together to form a new task force on election emergencies publishing a set of guidelines Thursday about how to protect the November election during the coronavirus pandemic — from expanding mail-in voting to sanitizing in-person voting locations.Given the pressure to postpone presidential primaries the National Task Force on Election Crises issued an 11-page guide aimed at public officials in charge of the general election saying “There is significant reason to be concerned and an imperative to prepare for the worst.”“This virus has been a wake-up call” Michael Chertoff the former secretary of Homeland Security under former president George W. Bush and a member of the task force told BuzzFeed News saying the task force had begun to form last year amid concerns of foreign interference misinformation and other disasters — including disease.The election should be held as required by federal law on Nov. 3 the report recommends saying maximum participation will bolster confidence in “the legitimacy of the outcome of the election.” (BuzzFeed News reported on March 13 why changing the general election date would be difficult and maybe logistically impossible.)“An event like the one we are going through now underscores the real importance of the public having faith in its institutions” Chertoff said adding that the task force’s diverse membership lends credibility as it puts pressure on secretaries of state and county election directors to adopt its recommendations.The task force’s members include prominent progressives such as Kristen Clarke executive director of Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law; Sherrilyn Ifill president and director-counsel NAACP Legal Defense Fund; and Vanita Gupta president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. It also includes conservative leaders including Trevor Potter former chair of the Federal Election Commission and Trey Grayson Kentucky’s former secretary of state.These are five of the task force’s recommendations:1. Expand access to vote by mail.Officials should contact voters proactively to ask if they want an absentee ballot. Not all states allow everyone to use a mail-in ballot (also called an absentee ballot or absentee voting) unless they declare a specific excuse in advance such as travel or an emergency. As such the task force said the chief election officials in each jurisdiction should immediately declare that “coronavirus is deemed a legally sufficient ‘excuse’ to enable absentee voting by all eligible voters… If this requires enacting emergency legislation in a jurisdiction state legislatures should do so.” Further the task force said elections officials should post PDFs of the forms online for voters to request those absentee ballots.The guide doesn’t recommend switching entirely to mail-in voting but it says “election officials should order sufficient quantities of paper ballots to conduct a 100% mail-based election if necessary.""2. Create more time to vote in person.In addition to hiring more poll workers to manage these new systems the guide encourages extending both voting hours and the number of days for early voting including on weekends in order to “reduce the number of people in a polling place at any one time thereby reducing the likelihood of coronavirus transmission.3. Keep polling sites sanitized.“Election officials should ensure that each polling place is well-stocked with hand sanitizer and antibacterial antimicrobial cleaning supplies which should be used among other things to disinfect voting machines and voting equipment (including pens and touchpads) between each and every use” the guide says. “Each poll worker should be provided with surgical gloves and a surgical mask (if consistent with public health guidance at the time).""4. Create distance inside polling sites.Officials should “prohibit any person known to be infected with the coronavirus from entering a polling place” when law allows the guidance says and provide those voters an absentee ballot. Inside polling facilities tape should be placed on the ground 6 feet apart “to indicate where voters should stand” when waiting in line. Voters should also be able to vote curbside or have separate sites for people at high risk — such as those with compromised immune systems.5. Consider changing voting locations.If an area is known to have an exceptionally high concentration of the virus or if a location presents an exceptional risk such as a nursing home officials should create a different polling site. It also suggests simply creating additional polling locations thereby “reducing the likely size of any crowds or number of people standing in line.” It also considers using bigger buildings — or “supercenters” — that allow more distance between each person. “Larger facilities may offer a good addition or alternative to smaller polling places.”"
104,The Senate Passed A Massive Coronavirus Aid Package That Would Give Most Americans A $1200 Check,Paul McLeod,BuzzFeed News,-1,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/paulmcleod/senate-coronavirus-bill-pass-checks-americans,WASHINGTON — The Senate passed a $2 trillion coronavirus aid bill late Wednesday evening the largest relief package in the country’s history.The recovery bill passed unanimously 96–0 (with four senators self-quarantining due to the coronavirus). It still has to clear the House before taking effect which could happen as early as Thursday. President Donald Trump has said he will immediately sign the bill into law.The package floods the country with money in an attempt to blunt the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus outbreak. It provides hundreds of billions of dollars to businesses state governments and the health care industry as well as direct cash injections to most American residents.The bill authorizes a direct payment of $1200 to every US resident with a social security number who makes up to $75000 per year plus $500 per child. People who earn more than $75000 will receive a smaller payment and the checks are phased out completely for people who make over $99000.Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin is authorized to dole out $500 billion in loans to distressed businesses including up to $29 billion earmarked for the airline industry. Another $350 billion in loans will got to providing eight weeks of cash flow for small businesses. The loans will be forgiven if the businesses maintain their payroll.Congress has been in tense around-the-clock negotiations for days and the bill’s final text was not released until around 10 p.m. a half an hour before voting began.The most contentious provision ended up being offering $600 per week over four months in federal unemployment assistance to laid-off employees. A small group of Republican senators argued these payments are so generous they would create a disincentive to work and they threatened to delay passage of the bill unless payments were capped.This caused Sen. Bernie Sanders counter-threaten to hold up the bill unless more strict conditions were put on corporate aid. In the end the Republican group failed to get Trump to back their cause. They put forward an amendment to cap unemployment payments which needed 60 votes to pass but failed on a 48–48 vote.The aid package now has to clear the House of Representatives. The House is currently in recess and it is not clear whether the bill will sail through quickly or if all 430 current members will need to be summoned from across the country for a full vote.The House has the tools to pass the bill immediately but if even a single member demands a full recorded vote on the House floor then the entire body will need to be recalled. There are grumblings in both parties. Progressives argue the bill is too friendly to big business and does not do enough for workers. Some Republicans say the bill contains too many Democratic pet projects and enlarges the size of government. Independent Rep. Justin Amash tweeted that the bill “is a raw deal for the people” that “does far too little for those who need the most help while providing hundreds of billions in corporate welfare.”But so far no member has committed to forcing a full vote. With rent checks coming due at the end of the month party leaders are urging passage without delay.Once the bill is signed into law Congress is scheduled to be out until April 20.Other key parts of the bill include:A tax credit of up to $10000 for wages paid by businesses hit hard by the coronavirus to incentivize keeping staff on the payroll.More than $3 billion in emergency funding for child care.Funding for states to immediately begin paying out unemployment benefits when someone is laid off.Allowing employers (but not employees) to defer paying their share of social security tax on wages. That tax would have to be paid over the next two years.A series of measures that expand telehealth services.$100 billion for hospitals and health care providers.A $150 billion relief fund for the states.$16 billion to acquire ventilators and other medical equipment.$4 billion for homeless assistance (though SNAP the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program formerly known as food stamps was not expanded in the bill).
105,Trump Said Democrats And The Media Want To Keep Businesses Closed To Hurt His Reelection Not Protect From The Coronavirus,Addy Baird,BuzzFeed News,-1,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/addybaird/coronavirus-trump-blames-media-democrats-economy,WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump again used his daily White House briefing on the coronavirus to rail against the press and Democrats arguing Wednesday that they oppose his idea to potentially reopen businesses within weeks because they want the economy to fail and hurt his reelection prospects.In recent days Trump has said he wants businesses in large parts of the country to reopen by Easter defying public health experts who say people need to continue isolating and social distancing for several months.When CBS News reporter Paula Reid asked Wednesday if the president's Easter timeline was linked to his political interests Trump lashed out.“The media would like to see me do poorly in the election” he said. “I think there are certain people who would like it not to open so quickly. There are certain people who would like [the economy] to do poorly because that would be very good as far as defeating me at the polls. I don't know if that's so but I think there are people in your profession that would like that to happen. I think it's very clear.”He continued telling Reid “I think it's very clear that there are people in your profession that write fake news. You do. She does. There are people in your profession that write fake news. They would love to see me for whatever reason — because we've done one hell of a job. Nobody's done the job that we've done. And it's lucky that you have this group here right here for this problem or you wouldn't even have a country left. Okay?”The president made a similar argument on Twitter earlier on Wednesday.Donald J. Trump✔@realDonaldTrumpThe LameStream Media is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our Country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success. The real people want to get back to work ASAP.  We will be stronger than ever before!219K4:04 PM - Mar 25 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy133K people are talking about thisThe plan Trump has said would be to lock down hot spots like New York where there are a high number of cases and let businesses in other parts of the country reopen in the coming weeks.But experts say the entire country does need to remain closed and people need to remain home for more than just a few more weeks. Vincent Racaniello a professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University told BuzzFeed News on Monday that there isn’t enough testing being done in the US to know how many people have been infected. This makes any plan to keep infection hot spots locked down impossible.“If you just lock down [those] who have clinical symptoms it's not going to do a damn thing” Racaniello said. “For god’s sake do people really not have any patience in this country? It was finite in China. It will be finite here.”Additionally according to estimates from the New York Times many states could hit peak cases in May several weeks after Easter.
106,Right-Wing Influencers Are Convinced Dr. Anthony Fauci Is Working With Hillary Clinton To Undermine Donald Trump,Ryan Broderick,BuzzFeed News,-1,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanhatesthis/qanon-right-wing-influencers-fauci-deep-state-clinton,"Right-wing influencers and QAnon supporters are waging an information war against Anthony Fauci the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and top-ranking member of the White House's Coronavirus Task Force. They are falsely claiming that Fauci is working with Hillary Clinton and the deep state to cause an economic collapse and discredit President Donald Trump.Followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory a labyrinthine belief system that posits that President Trump is waging a secret war against a global criminal organization have spent much of the COVID-19 outbreak struggling to fit the disease into their narratives. At first they theorized the virus was a bioweapon created by former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates. Then following remarks last month from radio host Rush Limbaugh a sizable contingent suggested that the virus was actually a deep state hoax meant to damage Trump politically.In recent days their baseless speculations have settled on Fauci. QAnon-supporting radio host Bill Mitchell has been the biggest promoter of the latest theory. For weeks Mitchell has been spinning a conspiracy theory that Fauci is a “Democrat plant"" and nicknamed him “Dr. #FearPorn.” Mitchell’s first tweets about Fauci date back to March 3 when Fauci first suggested the closure of schools and businesses.“Sorry President Trump but replace this crackpot” Mitchell tweeted. Several minutes later Mitchell tweeted about Fauci again “Have you ever seen the market drop 1000 points AFTER a 50 basis point Fed cut? That's #FearPorn. Thanks Dr. Anthony Fauci.”Mitchell’s ire against Fauci has seemed to grow over time as he insists the doctor is spreading fear about the outbreak to hurt the US economy. On March 8 Mitchell tweeted a link to a Fox News article about Fauci writing “AM I WRONG THINKING THIS FAUCI GUY IS A BIG DEMOCRAT SPREADING FEAR PORN?”A week later Mitchell shared a 2009 NIH interview with Fauci providing an update about the then-outbreak of H1N1 influenza. Mitchell insisted Fauci’s apparently calmer demeanor in the video — which was conducted during the Obama administration — was proof that the doctor was now sowing fear about the coronavirus to discredit Trump.“You'll notice none of the over-the-top hyperbole - none of the panic inducing rhetoric. Watch for yourselves” Mitchell tweeted.On the evening of March 20 Mitchell tweeted about Fauci 36 times in 30 minutes. Mitchell was enraged at Fauci going on CNN and publicly disagreeing with Trump’s suggestion that the CDC should allow the use of the anti-malaria drug chloroquine. Subsequently a man died and his wife needed critical care after they both took a drug containing chloroquine phosphate meant for aquariums after hearing the president speak about the drug.Mitchell’s tweetstorm against Fauci was intense. He repeatedly accused Fauci of being a Democrat plant reshared the 2009 H1N1 interview ran Twitter polls asking his followers if they thought Fauci was a Democrat accused him of destroying the economy and demanded Trump fire him.Mitchell finished his tweetstorm by digging through WikiLeaks’ collection of leaked emails and found an email Fauci sent to Clinton in 2013. “Is Fauci a Hillary plant? Think about this. Trump makes a hopeful statement on #hydrochloroquine and Fauci immediately runs to #CNN Trump's most hated #FakeNews outlet to contradict him? That is EXACTLY what a Hillary plant would do” he tweeted.It created a swarm. Mitchell’s discovery was written up by pro-Trump blog the Gateway Pundit which linked to his tweet and another containing a screenshot of a different Fauci email to Clinton.The next day conservative online magazine American Thinker published a piece titled “Anthony Fauci the NIH's face of the coronavirus is a Deep-State Hillary Clinton–loving stooge.” American Thinker also picked up the 2009 H1N1 interview. “It seems some viral infection pandemics are more equal than others. At least when it comes to burning a vibrant Trump economy to the ground” the article read. (The piece was shared Sunday by Fox News host Laura Ingraham.)The same press conference during which Fauci sparred with Trump over chloroquine ended with a viral moment where the doctor put his hand over his face seemingly in embarrassment as the president joked that the State Department was ""the deep state Department."" (Fauci later claimed he had a lozenge stuck in his throat.)The Fauci facepalm was seized on by Shiva Ayyadurai a GOP Senate candidate in Massachusetts who questionably claimed to have invented email and was briefly romantically connected to actor Fran Drescher. On March 20 Ayyadurai tweeted “Time to expose ‘Deep State’ Emperor Fauci & his ‘illustrious’ career of #FakeScience imposing ‘one-size-fits-all’ Medieval Mandated Medicine to profit his BIG PHARMA minions [at] the expense of crashing our economy.”Ayyadurai also shared Fauci’s email to Clinton and has made several Periscope videos accusing Fauci of being a member of the deep state. Ayyadurai’s video titled ""How To Kill Coronavirus"" was removed from YouTube for violating community standards. It told people to breathe in hot air from hair dryers.On Tuesday QAnon influencer Greg Rubini accused Fauci of making the novel coronavirus in 2015 receiving over 3000 retweets.The conspiracy theory has also been spreading on 4chan. On the site’s /pol/ message board anonymous users have posted dozens of huge threads about Fauci implying he’s part of a global pedophile ring after surfacing a photo of him and singer Elton John claiming Trump has secretly fired him and accusing him of being part of a global Jewish cabal.The campaign against Fauci is quickly becoming more mainstream — especially as Trump looks to put economic growth ahead of mitigating the damage caused by the virus. Fauci could become a target for conservative outlets like Fox News. Right now the channel is still backing him but that narrative could already be shifting. On Sunday Fox News host Steve Hilton sniped at Fauci for saying that he would be fine overreacting to a public health crisis.“Well that's easy for him to say. He'll still have a job at the end of this whatever happens” Hilton said. “Our ruling class and their TV mouthpieces — whipping up fear over this virus. They can afford an indefinite shutdown working Americans can't they'll be crushed by it.”Ingraham may have already telegraphed Fox News’ newest narrative for Fauci in a tweet the Fox anchor posted Tuesday. “The left-wing media’s methods are so transparent” she wrote. “1. Pressure Fauci to criticize @realDonaldTrump in interviews. 2. Hope this leads to a blowup. 3. Slam Trump for not listening to doctors. 4. Blame him for everything.”"
107,The $2 Trillion Coronavirus Aid Bill Is In Jeopardy As A Group Of Republican Senators Fight To Cap Unemployment Payments,Paul McLeod,BuzzFeed News,-1,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/paulmcleod/coronavirus-aid-bill-senate-unemployment-insurance,A group of Republican senators is threatening to stall the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill over unemployment insurance benefits causing Sen. Bernie Sanders to announce he will launch a counter-crusade against corporate aid.Congressional leaders reached a deal on a massive coronavirus aid package early Wednesday morning that includes hundreds of billions of dollars in funding to businesses plus monthly payments to all US residents of up to $1200.The final language is still being drafted but progress could be derailed over unemployment insurance (UI) benefits. The bill would pay $600 per week to unemployed workers on top of what they would receive at the state level. Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham Tim Scott Rick Scott and Ben Sasse argued that this could add up to more than many regular salaries causing people to quit their jobs.“You’re literally incentivizing taking people out of the workforce” said Graham. “If this is not a drafting error then it’s the worst idea I’ve seen in a long time.”The group does not yet have the numbers to stop the aid bill from passing but party leaders are hoping for an overwhelming — if not unanimous — vote in support of the bill to pressure the House of Representatives to pass it quickly and without further amendments. There is also the threat of the group winning over President Trump who could veto the legislation. Trump adviser and Fox personality Sean Hannity also blasted the UI provisions on his radio show Wednesday calling it a “socialist fantasy” that would “destroy the economy.”Graham’s proposal was to cap UI benefits at a person’s normal salary up to $600 per week. But his group got swift pushback from its own party. Finance Committee chair Chuck Grassley said the bill already contains incentives for businesses to keep employees on the payroll and nobody who leaves a job voluntarily is eligible to receive UI. He rejected the caps as unfeasible given the urgency of passing the bill.“Each state has a different UI program so the drafters opted for a temporary across-the-board UI boost of $600 which can deliver needed aid in a timely manner rather than burning time to create a different administrative regime for each state” said Grassley spokesperson George Hartmann.Sanders who is also running for the Democratic nomination jumped into the fray Wednesday afternoon by threatening to hold up the bill over corporate aid unless the Republican group left the unemployment provisions alone. Sanders tweeted that he would demand any corporation that receives government aid be required “not to lay off workers cut wages or benefits ship jobs overseas or pay workers poverty wages.”
108,The Senate Is Planning To Shut Down Soon Through Late April Amid The Coronavirus Outbreak,Kadia Goba,BuzzFeed News,-1,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kadiagoba/senate-leaving-dc-coronavirus-economic-recovery-bill,WASHINGTON — Senators are planning to leave Washington until April 20 to avoid further spread of the novel coronavirus after they pass a roughly $2 trillion stimulus bill this week according to four Senate aides.The chamber could vote as early as Wednesday on legislation to help deal with the economic fallout of the global pandemic which has rattled US markets. A plan is in the works to then have senators go home for several weeks after spending nine days in close contact with one another in the Capitol contrary to recommendations from public health officials to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people.The Senate had already planned to recess from April 6 to 17 for a district work period so the new plan would extend senators’ time away from the Capitol.Already one senator — Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul — has tested positive for COVID-19 the disease caused by the novel coronavirus but isn’t showing symptoms. Paul who had worked alongside senators for several days before receiving his test results has now quarantined himself and others who had contact with him have done the same. One of those senators Utah Sen. Mitt Romney announced Tuesday that he had tested negative for the disease.Earlier this month several senators insisted they could keep working as usual despite the fact that frequent travel and their advanced ages put them at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 (the average age for US senators is 62.9 years old). More recently a pair of senators sought to change the chamber’s rules so that they could vote remotely.A spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did not return a request for comment.It’s unclear if the House will follow suit. A spokesperson for Speaker Nancy Pelosi did not return a request for comment. Two members of the House have tested positive for the disease so far.Several other countries have suspended their legislative sessions including Canada which announced that its parliament would also close until April 20. However party leaders have recently returned to Ottawa to negotiate a large coronavirus response bill.The plans to recess in the Senate come after the Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommended gatherings of more than 10 people be canceled and after President Donald Trump declared a national emergency over the virus.
109,The White House Said People Who Left New York City Recently Need To Quarantine For 14 Days,Addy Baird,BuzzFeed News,-1,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/addybaird/trump-new-yorkers-left-coronavirus-quarantine-14-days,"WASHINGTON — White House officials on Tuesday called for people who left New York City in recent days to quarantine for two weeks in their new location saying that they might have unknowingly contracted the coronavirus before leaving.“Everybody who was in New York should be self-quarantining for the next 14 days to ensure the virus doesn’t spread to others no matter where they have gone whether it’s Florida North Carolina or out to far reaches of Long Island” Dr. Deborah Birx the White House coronavirus coordinator said at a press conference Tuesday. “We’re starting to see new cases across Long Island that suggest people have left the city. This will be very critical.”People should quarantine for 14 days based on the time they left New York meaning if a person left four days ago they should quarantine for 10 days Birx said.Dr. Anthony Fauci a member of the White House coronavirus task force and Vice President Mike Pence both reiterated Birx’s call.“What we’re seeing now is that understandably people want to get out of New York” Fauci said. “We don’t want that to be another seeding point for the rest of the country wherever they go.”According to Fauci about 1 in 1000 people in New York are infected which is about eight to ten times higher than rates in other places. New York state has reported 25677 cases of COVID-19 the disease caused by the novel coronavirus and 167 deaths so far according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.Pence in his remarks said it’s clear that New York City is now the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the US. “We have to deal with the New York metropolitan area as a high-risk area” he said.Still President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he wants businesses to be up and running again across the country by Easter contradicting public health experts. Fauci told reporters Tuesday that the date was ""very flexible.""""We just had a conversation with the president in the Oval Office talking about you know you can look at a date but you've got to be very flexible on it literally a day-by-day week-by-week basis. You need to evaluate the feasibility of what you are trying to do"" Fauci said."
110,"Trump Said He Wants People ""Back To Work"" By Easter. His Medical Advisers Pushed Back.",Miriam Elder,BuzzFeed News,-1,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/miriamelder/coronavirus-trump-easter-covid-19-economy,"President Donald Trump said Tuesday he hoped to have the country “back to work” by Easter setting the most concrete deadline yet as his attention turns from stopping the onslaught of the coronavirus and toward restarting the ailing US economy.He received immediate pushback and hedging from some of his advisers — including Dr. Deborah Birx the response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force Surgeon General Jerome Adams and even Vice President Mike Pence — after making the statement during a Fox News town hall.“I’d love to have it open by Easter” Trump said. “I would love to have that. It’s such an important day for other reasons but I’ll make it an important day for this too. I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter.” Easter falls on April 12 this year.The deadline does not have any medical significance for slowing the spread of the coronavirus and Trump did not immediately give any reason for the date. It also conflicts with what New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo suggested just hours earlier could be the peak for the outbreak in his state which Pence has called the “epicenter” for the virus outbreak in the United States.In an interview on Fox News later Tuesday afternoon Trump said Easter ""is a very special day for me"" and that it would be ""great to have all of the churches full.""""So I think Easter Sunday and you will have packed churches all over our country. I think it would be a beautiful time and it's just about the timeline that I think is right"" he later added. He said he isn't ""sure"" that would be the official deadline.By his Tuesday night White House press briefing Trump had begun to hedge the Easter deadline saying his administration would ""look at it we'll only do it if it's good and maybe we do sections of the country we do large sections of the country"" and that he's talking with the medical advisers.""I just thought it was a beautiful time"" he said when asked who suggested the date. ""It's a beautiful time a beautiful timeline.""In public statements and tweets in the past few days Trump has made clear he is growing more concerned about the economic fallout of the outbreak of COVID-19 the disease caused by the novel coronavirus as many Americans retreat to their homes and both small and large businesses fire workers en masse following a sharp drop in demand. A growing discourse on the right has floated sacrificing the lives of those most at risk of the virus — the elderly and those with underlying conditions — in exchange for focusing on an economic revival.It is unclear what Trump could actually do to “open” the country — shelter-in-place orders come from governors not the federal government. And how the economy would even restart if financial centers like New York City are still dealing with an unprecedented medical crisis is uncertain. But his words send an important signal to people looking for guidance as they maneuver a fast-moving pandemic and it’s advice that medical professionals are not remotely sanctioning.Trump received almost immediate pushback to his Easter deadline from members of the White House’s Coronavirus Task Force who took part in the Fox News town hall alongside him in the Rose Garden. Adams the surgeon general said: “We will assess at the end of the 14 days and we’ll figure out the most appropriate thing to do.” He praised Trump for listening to his medical and scientific advisers. “Based on my experience the president will make the appropriate decision based on all the data” he said.Birx urged Americans to continue following the White House guidelines designed to slow the spread of the virus which were released on March 16 and provided for 15 days of action. “Every American needs to continue the president’s guidelines for these next six days or seven days. We have to have them following those guidelines” she said as Adams nodded along. Trump then broke in to say that his thinking had changed once it appeared that the mortality rate of COVID-19 was lower than the worst case estimates. (There is no way to know the true mortality rate since testing has been so limited in the United States.)“Excuse me just one second” Trump said. “You can’t compare this to 1918 where close to 100 million people died” he said referring to the 1918 flu pandemic. “If you got it you had a 50/50 chance or very close of dying. I think we’re substantially under 1% because the people that get better are not reporting” he said. “When they came into my office don’t forget — they said 3% 4% 5% — there’s a very big difference. No – we have to put our country back to work.”After following the guidance of medical professionals for the first few weeks of the crisis Trump has grown increasingly frustrated. “They came in experts and said we’re gonna have to close the country. I said 'Are you serious about this?' We are going to take this country that is fully employed and you’re telling me we have to close it? And people are gonna go out of business and they’re gonna go bankrupt and they’re not gonna have jobs?“I gave it two weeks” he said.Trump tried to allay concerns that he was turning sour on Dr. Anthony Fauci the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who has become a public face of reassurance during the crisis and was absent from both the town hall and Monday’s White House press briefing. “We get along very well” Trump said in response to a question from Fox News host Bill Hemmer who then asked “Your relationship is good?” “I think it’s been very good. You would have heard about it if it wasn’t.” He called both Fauci and Birx “extraordinary.”But Trump has never navigated a crisis of this length or depth in his three years as president. And he is known to bore easily while also turning on advisers who don’t tell him what he wants to hear or who grab too much of the spotlight. Fauci and Birx have tried to approach those issues diplomatically but have also seemed to find it increasingly difficult to hide their momentary frustrations with the president during briefings and Fauci recently gave a forthright interview in which he described working with Trump.Fauci who spoke at the Tuesday night White House briefing said the Easter timeline is ""really very flexible"" and that he had just talked with Trump about the timeline in the Oval Office prior to the briefing.Birx and Adams made clear in Tuesday’s town hall that they were not ready to endorse Trump’s Easter deadline. Nor was Pence who said governors had brought down various orders to enforce social distancing. “We defer to that we respect that” he said. “We want to open the country as soon as we can. The more people that put into practice the president’s coronavirus guidelines the sooner we’ll be able to open up.”Trump stuck to his guns.”I think it’s possible — why isn’t it?” he asked referring to the Easter deadline. He doubled down on his theory that the number of people who would die by suicide in a recession or depression would outnumber those who could die of the virus.“We need to get our country back to work’ he said. “If we delay this thing out you’re gonna lose more people than you’re losing with the situation as we know it.”More than 50000 people are known to have contracted the coronavirus in the United States and more than 600 are known to have died."
111,Stimulus checks: How much money will you get and when?,AIMEE PICCHI,CBS,-1,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/stimulus-checks-coronavirus-relief-package-how-much-when/,"The $2 trillion stimulus bill passed in the Senate includes help for American families who are hurting financially due to the economic impact of the coronavirus. Most adults will receive $1200 checks plus $500 for each of their children.The massive relief package will funnel $290 billion in direct payments to individuals and families. The measure isn't over the line yet as the bill must now go the House but households are expected to get a check within weeks or months. That could provide a lifeline for the millions of Americans who have already been laid off or seen their income plunge as people hole up to avoid infection.""Low- and middle-income households would receive about 68 percent of the payments"" noted Tax Policy Center senior fellow Howard Gleckman in a blog post. Here's what to know about how the payments will work."
112,Department of Veterans Affairs faces onslaught of coronavirus patients,JIM AXELROD,CBS,-1,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-department-of-veterans-affairs-faces-onslaught-of-patients/,"Last Updated Mar 26 2020 7:22 PM EDTThe Department of Veterans Affairs the nation's largest health care system is seeing an onslaught of coronavirus patients. The department which cares for millions of elderly veterans has now confirmed nearly 500 cases — a 60% spike since Tuesday.In Philadelphia the challenge is stark: serving a population of 55000 vets with 102 beds.Karen Flaherty-Oxler the retired rear admiral who runs the VA center in Philadelphia told CBS News that the department was able to expand by about 50 beds — but when asked if that would be enough she said ""We're not sure.""The average veteran served by the VA is older than 60. And many have underlying health conditions making them especially vulnerable to respiratory issues from coronavirus.When asked if there were enough ventilators Flaherty-Oxler said the department has some on order. ""We put in an order in anticipation that 30 or 40 percent of the veterans we see may need some ventilatory support"" she said. ""Are you anticipating a crisis?"" CBS News asked. ""I'm not"" Flaherty-Oxler said. The Philadelphia VA emphasized that it has been providing primary care for years and tracking veterans who are most vulnerable so it is prepared to treat those veterans if they contract the virus.But Dr. Lewis Kaplan a surgeon at the Philadelphia VA medical center said that when their patients get sick ""they get really sick.""""Our typical patient might have heart disease and peripheral arterial disease…"" Kaplan added. ""So we worry [...] when they need care that they're going to be a challenging patient to look after and some of them really are."" ""Does 150 beds seem like enough for 50000-plus veterans?"" CBS News asked. ""I hope it is"" Kaplan responded. ""I'm worried that it's not."""
113,"Surging anti-Asian hate crimes being tracked during coronavirus pandemic: ""Things are getting very physical""",ERIN DONAGHUE,CBS,-1,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-pandemic-anti-asian-hate-crimes-tracking/,"As Asian-Americans face an increase in assaults and verbal abuse amid the coronavirus pandemic advocates are tracking hundreds of the incidents online to understand the scope of the problem which they say appears to be growing and becoming more serious. California Governor Gavin Newsom has described a ""huge increase"" in assaults targeting the Asian-American community in his state and in New York Attorney General Letitia James launched a hotline for victims of coronavirus-related bias crimes. It can be difficult to understand the extent of the problem advocates say but knowing the scope can help legitimize the issue and help advocates develop ways to begin to address it.""I think it's important to have as accurate a picture as you can of what the situation looks like here in the states"" said Gregg Orton national director of the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans an umbrella group of advocacy organizations. ""It makes people understand that this is the reality and the lived experiences of many Asian-Americans.""Media reports have offered disturbing glimpses into that reality. In New York this month a student from Korea was punched in the face by a woman who asked her ""Where is your [expletive] mask you coronavirus [expletive.]""  And the New York Times interviewed nearly two dozen Asian Americans who described being afraid to go to the grocery store or let their children outside. One San Francisco resident Yuanyuan Zhu told the paper she was walking to her gym when a man started yelling at her used an expletive about China and shouted ""run them over"" when a bus passed. Zhu 26 said the man then spit on her.""Asian Americans like everyone else in the country are fearful of the virus and trying their best to stay safe and healthy"" said John Yang president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice. ""To layer on this notion of being targeted because they're Asian Americans and have that added threat to their physical and psychological safety is really bad and has to be stopped.""Several groups including Yang's are using online reporting tools as a way to gather more data. Asian Americans Advancing Justice has tracked anti-Asian hate crimes for years but is now tracking incidents directly related to the coronavirus. The group's online reporting tool StandAgainstHatred.org allows victims to self report incidents of discrimination verbal harassment or assault against Asian-Americans. The group also monitors media reports and people who report incidents on their social media accounts. Yang said the group is seeing a ""very sharp increase"" of the incidents in recent weeks mirroring the spread of the virus globally. The group has tracked about 3-4 incidents a day ranging from assaults to verbal abuse and name-calling by people who make specific references to the coronavirus or refer to all Asian-Americans as Chinese. ""The idea seems to be that all Asian-Americans are carriers of the virus or somehow Asian Americans in many cases that have been here for generations were the cause of this virus spread in the U.S."" Yang said.In one incident reported on StandAgainstHatredorg a victim reported being approached by someone outside a Brooklyn grocery store who said ""Chinese people f---- everything up.""""I am a fifth-generation Asian-American and wore my protective mask for the first time that day"" the victim wrote.Rhetoric from President Donald Trump and other top officials who have referred to COVID-19 as ""The Chinese virus"" fuels the racism Yang said.""Reporting on these cases also demonstrates that words matter"" Yang said. ""Often words used by perpetrators of hate crimes mirror the words used by certain elected officials or influencers.""In California the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council and the Chinese for Affirmative Action launched their website Stop AAPI Hate last week in response to growing news reports about hate crimes and discrimination targeting Asian-Americans. Cynthia Choi the co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action said the website has been flooded with reports of incidents since it launched on March 19. As of Tuesday they had collected 550 reports. Most of the incidents happened in March and a handful in February Choi said.The incidents ranged from verbal abuse and harassment to physical assaults such as kicking and punching. Many happened in grocery stores or parks some walking on streets and others by their own neighbors. Disturbingly Choi said she's noted multiple reports of people saying they've been spat on or coughed on. ""What's shocking given that we're in a public health crisis is people trying to spit and cough into people's faces -- that's something that's happening to a great degree"" Choi said. ""Things are getting very physical people throwing bottles people who are pushing people into harm's way. And yes it seems like the violence is certainly on the rise.""The groups initially intended to track California incidents but soon decided to expand the data tool to include incidents nationwide because of the scope of the issue. Launched in conjunction with the San Francisco State University Asian American Studies Department the tool is available in multiple languages and allows users to report the information with the promise that personal information will be kept confidential. The group does not share information with law enforcement but encourages people to also call 911 if they fear for their safety Choi said.Choi says she hopes the data will help victims understand they aren't alone. Eventually she hopes the data can be used to help develop education campaigns promote de-escalation tips and connect victims to resources.""We really need to combat this with public education and awareness and the ability to engage with people in a safe way that really promotes that this is not acceptable behavior"" Choi said.Groups including Choi's and Yang's are communicating and may join forces to better track the cases. Both say many more incidents are likely going unreported and that the current data is only ""scratching the surface."" Victims of hate incidents may be reluctant to come forward over fear of continued targeting or a desire to move on from the incident said Orton which is why tracking tools can help.""It's understandable why it may not be at the top of the list to come forward and share their story and that's part of the reason why websites and reporting tools from trusted community groups are really important"" Orton said."
114,3 migrant children in U.S. custody test positive for coronavirus,CAMILO MONTOYA-GALVEZ,CBS,-1,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-3-migrant-children-test-positive/,"Three unaccompanied migrant children in U.S. government custody have tested positive for the coronavirus federal officials said Thursday highlighting concerns among advocates about the vulnerability of detained immigrants during the global pandemic.The three minors who are housed in a shelter in New York are the first confirmed coronavirus cases among the 3600 unaccompanied children in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement or ORR. In response to the outbreak the refugee agency has stopped releasing migrant children in New York facilities to sponsors who are typically family members living in the U.S. No further discharge restrictions have been made as of Thursday an ORR spokesperson said. The agency had previously stopped placing minors in shelters and programs in California New York and Washington. In addition to the three confirmed cases ORR has tested 15 other children in its custody as of Thursday. Eleven results came back negative and the rest are pending. The agency is consulting with local health authorities in New York to ""determine next steps.""Officials also revealed on Thursday that the number of positive coronavirus cases among staff members and contractors at facilities for unaccompanied migrant children has grown to seven. Six of them work in New York and one is a staff member in Texas. A foster parent in Washington also tested positive for the virus earlier this month. The refugee agency said it is also notifying anyone who may have been exposed to the workers.Coronavirus is particularly dangerous for older people and those with underlying medical issues but children and young people can carry and transmit the virus even if the risk of serious illness is relatively low. Migrant minors in ORR custody crossed the southern border without parents or guardians or in certain circumstances were separated from them. The announcement on Thursday is likely to fuel even more calls for the Trump administration to quickly release some of the tens of thousands of immigrants it is currently detaining especially as the public health crisis to contain the coronavirus intensifies. On Wednesday lawyers asked a federal court in California to require officials to release unaccompanied migrant children who have been in government custody for more than a month or transfer them to facilities where social distancing can be reasonably practiced.Similar calls have been made for Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE to reduce its detainee population which stood at more than 38000 over the weekend. Despite confirmed coronavirus cases among detainees and staff at detention facilities the agency has not moved to significantly downsize its detainee population. In response to the pandemic ORR an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services is also prioritizing placing migrant children in local facilities after receiving them from Department of Homeland Security officials who are generally the first to apprehend unaccompanied minors near the southern border. Officials said the move is designed to avoid air travel.Last week ORR leadership also issued guidance requiring that migrant children in its custody undergo mandatory temperature checks twice day agency officials said. If a child has a temperature higher than 100 degrees the shelters have to notify the government.Under U.S. law the Department of Homeland Security is generally required to transfer unaccompanied migrant children in its custody to ORR within 72 hours. The children stay in ORR custody until they are released to sponsors.Two years ago the agency struggled to house the thousands of minors who the Trump administration separated from their parents or guardians as part of the controversial ""zero tolerance"" policy."

116,MENSTRUATION OR MURDER: DID A SUSPECT HIDE BLOOD EVIDENCE IN PLAIN SIGHT?,Erin Moriarty,CBS,-1,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/lizzy-borden-case-blood-evidence-48-hours/,It's a fact. Many people are squeamish when it comes to talking about bodily functions like a woman's monthly menstruation.  So did a young suspect take advantage of that discomfort to get away with two murders? Did she clean up a blood trail and place the evidence out in the open knowing that male investigators wouldn't take a closer look? That could explain why a case that took place more than a century ago continues to baffle crime experts to this day.The suspect in question is Lizzie Borden.  On the morning of August 4 1892 Lizzie's father Andrew Borden and her stepmother Abby were found murdered in the family home in Fall River Massachusetts.  They had both been bludgeoned to death with a sharp object believed to be a hatchet.Lizzie 32 quickly became the main suspect with both motive and opportunity. She hated her stepmother and stood to inherit millions in today's money from her father's death. What's more while her older sister Emma was miles away visiting friends at the time of the murders Lizzie Borden was at home with no credible alibi. The investigation revealed that on the day before the murders a woman identified as Lizzie reportedly tried to buy prussic acid to repair she said a sealskin cape. A suspicious druggist refused to sell it to her.  The circumstantial evidence pointed to Lizzie. And yet where was the blood? Investigators were stumped by a lack of blood evidence linking Lizzie to the murders. Abby Borden who was murdered first in an upstairs bedroom had been struck as many as 19 times. Andrew struck while sleeping on a couch was hit multiple times in the head. If Lizzie was the killer wouldn't she be covered in blood spatter? Wouldn't she have left a trail of blood? A next-door neighbor who came to the house shortly after Andrew died saw no blood on Lizzie or her clothing. Two days after the murders cops searched the house and found no blood-soaked clothing. The only blood found on Lizzie Borden was a tiny speck on an underskirt.In fact evidence of a cleanup may have been in front of the officers all along and they discounted it. When investigators searched the house they encountered what appeared to be bloody cloths or rags in a pail in the basement. When Lizzie indicated that she was menstruating a fact confirmed by the family doctor investigators took her at her word and moved on never actually examining the contents of the pail. Later the family housekeeper Bridget Sullivan — who had done the family laundry earlier in the week — wondered why she had not seen the pail at the time but it was too late.If in fact that pail contained evidence of a crime-scene cleanup then the person who put those rags there had clearly planned the murders gambling on the well-known male reluctance to deal with female bodily functions. It may have been a brilliant plan that not only helped clear Lizzie Borden of murder but left us all still fascinated by a crime that will never be truly solved.
117,New Orleans could run out of ventilators as early as April 2 governor warns,AUDREY MCNAMARA,CBS,-1,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-new-orleans-could-run-out-of-ventilators-as-early-as-april-2-governor-warns/,"Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said at a press conference Thursday that the number of confirmed coronavirus cases across the state has surged. He also warned that if the state does not start flattening its curve New Orleans could run out of key medical supplies by early April. According to Edwards as of Thursday Louisiana has at least 2305 positive cases of COVID-19 and 83 deaths — 18 of which were reported since Wednesday. Edwards said that a 17-year-old from New Orleans is among the dead calling it a ""very disturbing piece of information.""The virus has taken a strong hold on the state particularly in New Orleans. Officials estimate that New Orleans could run out of life-saving ventilators by the first week of April. Edwards echoed that warning on Thursday and said that if the state does not flatten its curve soon the city could run out of ventilators as early as April 2 and potentially be out of hospital beds by April 7.""It's not conjecture it's not some flimsy theory this is not a scare tactic this is what is going to happen"" he said.Doctors and elected officials believe the skyrocketing number of cases is connected to Mardi Gras the month-long celebration that typically draws huge crowds to the city in February CBS News correspondent Omar Villafranca reports.Bourbon Street the iconic thoroughfare in New Orleans' French Quarter neighborhood was shut down earlier this month. The French Quarter stayed open during Hurricane Katrina in 2005.On Thursday however Governor Edwards stressed that cases of coronavirus are spread across the state. He said that cases have now been confirmed in a vast majority of the state's parishes not just metropolitan areas. ""Nobody should look at this situation and think this doesn't involve me... this coronavirus is in your neighborhood"" Edwards said. ""There is no place where it isn't. There are places where we haven't detected it yet.""The governor pleaded for people to follow social distancing guidelines and limit trips for groceries and other essential items. ""All you have to do to save lives is stay home"" he said.At his daily press briefing on Thursday New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said that Louisiana is a ""hotspot"" for the virus. New York has 37258 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. That's by far the highest number of any state — but New York has also deployed the most tests of any state.""(Louisiana) has a cluster that is growing and the people in Louisiana and in New Orleans are in our thoughts and prayers"" Cuomo said. ""We know what they're going through. And we feel for them and we pray for them and we know the difficulty they're under because we're dealing with the same type of situation. So our best to them. Anyway we can help them we stand ready.""Edwards said that Louisiana's medical system would not be able to handle the surge in cases projected to come without social distancing.""We cannot surge the (medical) capacity to meet the need if we do not bend the curve. We cannot"" he said.""There is no reason why the things that you see coming out of Italy wouldn't happen here in Louisiana if people don't engage seriously in these mitigation measures"" he added."

But it is unclear whether it will be approved by a voice vote or recorded vote. Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters Thursday that the House would try for a voice vote meaning the presiding officer would call for the ""ayes"" and ""nays"" from members present on the floor and determine which side prevails. A quorum is assumed in a voice vote meaning a bill may pass even if a majority of lawmakers are not physically present.Some House members have indicated they might object to a voice vote. Republican Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky told the Courier-Journal Thursday he was having a ""hard time"" with the concept of a voice vote as only 218 representatives out of 435 are needed to be present to have a quorum in the House. Most representatives are currently in their districts with several in self-quarantine due to exposure to the coronavirus.President Trump criticized Massie in two tweets calling him a ""third rate Grandstander"" and calling for him to be removed from the Republican Party.Donald J.

Members who had expected to remain home traveled by car or in near-empty planes to rush to the Capitol by 10 a.m.Pelosi said Thursday that if there's a demand for a roll call vote she can resort to a procedure called ""vote by proxy"" whereby a lawmaker who is there can inform the clerk how a member who is not there intends to vote.The House convened at 9 a.m. and will have up to three hours of debate ahead of the vote.Two House members have tested positive for the new coronavirus and dozens have self-quarantined due to exposure or symptoms.The relief measure passed in a 96-0 vote in the Senate earlier this week after lengthy negotiations between Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and White House officials. The bill expands unemployment insurance provides direct payments to most Americans and includes hundreds of billions of dollars in loans and grants to corporations hospitals state and local governments and more. An amendment proposed by three Republicans threatened to delay the bill's passage but it failed along party lines.The bill is ""phase three"" legislation to address the pandemic. Mr. Trump has signed two other relief bills and voiced support for this measure. He said he will sign the bill once it is passes in the House."

He says the man likes to eat on the patio on weekdays and on weekends he often brings his family for brunch. They'd like to thank him.""It's funny because we have regulars who have been coming in forever and they're our friends but we don't always know their names. We know their faces their orders their favorite tables but we don't know exactly who they are"" Edlund told the newspaper.Edlund was forced to lay off 90% of his 200 employees over the past week. He's keeping some of his restaurants open with skeleton crews preparing take-out services.The $10000 tip was the most benevolent act his workers have seen but Edlund says it's not the only one. He said many servers received big tips last week and they continue to get them as regular customers pick up curbside orders."
120,Trump tells governors to expect new coronavirus guidelines on social distancing,KATHRYN WATSON,CBS,-1,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronvirus-social-distancing-guidelines-trump-letter-governors/,"Washington — In a letter to the nation's governors on Thursday President Trump said his administration is working on new guidelines to help state and local policymakers determine whether they should maintain increase or relax social distancing measures they've put in place to mitigate the fallout from the coronavirus.On March 16 the White House issued guidelines about how Americans can ""slow the spread"" of the virus over a 15-day period but governors and local officials have been making decisions about closing businesses and schools for themselves. In Washington D.C. the mayor has ordered the closing of all non-essential businesses until at least April 24.Mr. Trump has established a goal of Easter Sunday April 12 for returning Americans to work and the economy to some version of normalcy although he concedes that won't be possible everywhere and public health experts warn Easter is much too soon to consider relaxing measures to stop the spread of the virus.""There is still a long battle ahead but our efforts are already paying dividends"" the president said in his letter Thursday. ""As we enhance protections against the virus Americans across the country are hoping the day will soon arrive when they can resume their normal economic social and religious lives.""""In furtherance of this shared goal my administration is working to publish new guidelines for state and local policymakers to use in making decisions about maintaining increasing or relaxing social distancing and other mitigation measures they have put in place"" he continued.The president said expanded testing will inform those criteria which will be crafted in coordination with public health officials and scientists and used to classify individual counties as high-risk medium-risk or low-risk areas.""As testing gives us more information about who has been infected we are tracking the virus and isolating it to prevent further spread"" Mr. Trump wrote. ""This new information will drive the next phase in our war against this invisible enemy.""Mr. Trump has expressed impatience by the economic toll the virus is inflicting as businesses around the country shutter. Weekly jobless claims soared Thursday to roughly 3.3 million the greatest one-week increase on record.Meanwhile governors and hospitals are urging the president to use his full authority under the Defense Production Act to produce ventilators masks and other needed equipment. The president has been reluctant to do so suggesting companies are ramping up production voluntarily and telling governors to try to get the equipment on their own first.But the governors have pointed out to the president they're competing against the federal government's bids for much-needed ventilators and other equipment."
121,Trump touts great success as US becomes world's worst virus epicenter,Stephen Collinson,CNN,-1,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/politics/donald-trump-coronavirus-response/index.html,"As America became the epicenter of the global coronavirus pandemic President Donald Trump downplayed the escalating national crisis.His comments at Thursday's afternoon briefing underscored the growing duality of the fight: While the President is telling a tale of great successes of a government powerfully mobilizing front-line health care workers are facing gruesome scenes in hospitals in a growing number of hot spots.Later ignoring traditional codes of the presidency at a time of trial the President lashed out in a TV interview at Democratic governors channeling appeals from overwhelmed health care workers in their home states as Covid-19 exacts an increasing toll.And he appeared set on contradicting the advice of one of his top task force members Dr. Anthony Fauci who told CNN that only the virus can set the timeline for reopening the country.All the evidence of the virus's advance seen in rising death tolls and infection figures suggests the situation is getting worse and that normal life could be weeks or months away. Once Trump minimized the looming impact of the crisis. Now his assessments conflict with the reality of its deadly march.On Thursday a day that saw more reported deaths from Covid-19 than ever before in the United States -- Trump bizarrely turned the focus to what he said was a far lower mortality rate than he had expected.A week ago there were a total of 8800 confirmed infections in the United States and 149 deaths. On Thursday that figure reached more than 82000 with nearly 1200 deaths. Were those figures the result of a hurricane or a terrorist attack their human toll would be more obvious and it would be more difficult for the President to spin the situation. But as people die unseen in hospital wards and emergency rooms the emotional impact of the accelerating tragedy is less obvious than it would be during a natural disaster.Still the weight of the data is beginning to tell its own story.The US overtook China on Thursday as the nation with the most confirmed infections. Yet in a White House news conference Trump expressed hopes that the nightmare would not last ""much longer.""Later he took to the comfortable surroundings of Sean Hannity's show on Fox News. He rebuked New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for saying this week that his state needed 30000 extra ventilators to cope with the coronavirus surge -- suggesting his longtime sparring partner was asking for machines he didn't need.After it emerged that Washington Gov. Jay Inslee had criticized the federal response on a call with governors and the President earlier Thursday Trump blasted his critic as a ""failed presidential candidate."" And as officials in Michigan registered increasing concern about a building crisis in the Great Lakes State the President hit out at Gov. Gretchen Whitmer saying ""all she does is sit there and blame the federal government.""As doctors say they still lack sufficient masks and other protective gear Trump had earlier in the day read out a list of equipment delivered by federal authorities giving the impression there was more than enough.Despite the clearly widening spread of the pandemic which by definition cascades across wide geographical areas and reaches peaks in each hot spot at different times Trump intensified a push to reopen the economy saying he would issue a relaxation of some social distancing guidelines next week.And he stressed repeatedly that nobody could have foreseen the possibility of the pandemic despite warnings issued by the US intelligence community earlier this year.Any president and any administration would have been battered by the task of combating a generational pandemic involving a virulent ""invisible enemy"" as Trump calls it.But it's unlikely any other modern administration would spend so much time praising its own performance -- even as the crisis magnifies by the day.""I think they think we're doing a really good job in terms of running this whole situation having to do with the virus"" Trump said at the White House referring to the American people. ""I think they feel that myself and the administration are doing a good job. ... There was a lot of fear and a lot of good things are happening.""New crisis spots are fast emergingThe President spoke on a day when New York's crisis over the coronavirus deepened and another disaster began to unfold in New Orleans while California slipped into worse trouble and new hot spots appeared to be emerging in Chicago and Detroit.One doctor in New York warned of ""apocalyptic"" scenes at her hospital a lack of protective equipment for staff and a refrigerated truck brought in to hold bodies in comments to The New York Times.But Trump sought to minimize the lethality of the virus.""A lot of good things are happening. The mortality rate is in my opinion ... way way down"" the President said. ""That takes a lot of fear out. It's one thing to have it. It's another thing to die. When I first got involved I was told numbers much higher than the number that seems to be.""The President's comments on a day when more than 200 Americans were reported to have died risked coming across as callous.They also minimized the impact of the crisis. The coronavirus is so problematic because even if it kills only 1.5% of the people who get infected it is highly contagious has no vaccine and humans have no immunity to it. That means rising cases risk crashing the US hospital system overwhelming available equipment and forcing doctors -- who are risking their own health and lives to treat patients -- to choose who lives and dies.Such scenarios are the reasons why the White House introduced social distancing recommendations nearly two weeks ago and why many governors and mayors have clamped shut their jurisdictions in a desperate bid to stop the spread of the disease.Yet Trump who now appears impatient with his own decisions wrote to state governors Thursday to alert them to forthcoming guidelines based on areas of geographic risk.The President plans to identify ""high-risk medium risk and low-risk"" counties where different measures would be appropriate.""We have to get back to work. Our people want to work. They want to go back. They have to go back. And we're going to be talking about dates. We're going to be talking with a lot of great professionals"" Trump told reporters.""This is a country that was built on getting it done and our people want to go back to work. I'm hearing -- I'm hearing it loud and clear from everybody.""Trump is right that Americans need to get back to work. New Labor Department data Thursday showed 3.28 million Americans filed for jobless benefits since the government effectively closed down the economy to slow the virus.The figures encapsulated the terrible dilemma that faces the President -- between safeguarding the collective wealth and well-being of the country and the thousands or even millions of Americans who could get sick. But while his subordinates insist they will follow the data to make wise decisions judging by the President's remarks he appears to have already made up his mind.'Los Angeles may become the new New York'A piecemeal reopening of the economy will eventually be the model that could get the nation's vital economic engine running again. But Trump's accelerated timeline appears not to be based on the science.Vice President Mike Pence vowed to examine data very carefully and to present Trump with ""a range of recommendations and additional guidance for going forward.""But some medical experts fear that relaxing social distancing guidelines in other areas where there is not yet a strong penetration of the virus could squander success so far in keeping it from spreading more widely.Others argue that there has not been sufficient testing conducted across the country to safely adopt Trump's county-by-county approach and point out that people from the worst affected areas could easily travel to relatively free areas.Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said on CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper"" that it was far too early to start easing distancing.""Iran was the new China. Italy was the new Iran Spain was the new Italy. New York was the new Spain. Los Angeles may become the new New York"" Garcetti said. ""It's going to be in Topeka. It's going to be in Atlanta. It's going to be in Louisville. It's already there.""Dr. Richard Besser former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned on CNN's ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" that testing capability was not yet sufficient to provide confidence that easing social distancing was merited.""Until there is widespread testing available and we can understand the various timelines and understand the significance of transmission by children by people who are asymptomatic it is really premature to talk about lightening up and opening certain areas. In the future that is clearly something you'd want to do"" he said."
122,Trump previews new social distancing guidelines based on geographic risks,Kevin Liptak,CNN,-1,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/politics/trump-governors-guidlines/index.html,"President Donald Trump told US governors on Thursday his administration was preparing to issue new potentially more relaxed social distancing guidelines based on geographic risk factors for the novel coronavirus even as some health experts warn it's too early to allow Americans to congregate in large groups or return to their workplaces.In a letter Trump said new coronavirus testing capabilities would allow his administration to identify ""high-risk medium risk and low-risk"" counties where different levels of social distancing would be appropriate.""Our expanded testing capabilities will quickly enable us to publish criteria developed in close coordination with the Nation's public health officials and scientists to help classify counties with respect to continued risks posed by the virus"" he wrote.New more tailored guidelines will help governors and other state policymakers decide on ""maintaining increasing or relaxing social distancing and other mitigation measures they have put in place"" Trump wrote.Not all members of the White House coronavirus task force had seen Trump's letter before it was released publicly a task force source said who added the President's plan detailed in the letter is still a work in progress.The President has been itching to loosen the 15-day social distancing measures he announced last week in a bid to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.During an early evening news conference Trump repeatedly stressed the US ""has to go back to work"" but suggested social distancing guidelines could be used as they returned.""When we are open as soon as we open that doesn't mean you will be stop the guidelines. You will still try and distance yourself. Maybe not to the same extent because you have to lead a life but the timing is coming"" Trump said.Even as he's agitated to relax the guidelines however some state governors have implemented new restrictions on nonessential businesses and large gatherings.Trump said this week that he'd like to see the country ""raring to go"" by Easter on April 12 a date that many health experts say is unlikely.""There is still a long battle ahead but our efforts are already paying dividends"" he wrote in the letter. ""As we enhance protections against the virus Americans across the country are hoping the day will soon arrive when they can resume their normal economic social and religious lives.""Some of Trump's health advisers have warned that loosening guidelines on social distancing before the virus is contained would worsen its spread. They have cautioned against creating arbitrary deadlines on reopening the country.""You've got to understand that you don't make the timeline the virus makes the timeline"" Dr. Anthony Fauci the nation's top infectious disease specialist said on CNN on Wednesday. ""So you've got to respond in what you see happen. And if you keep seeing this acceleration it doesn't matter what you say. One week two weeks three weeks -- you've got to go with what the situation on the ground is.""Trump has insisted that as conditions improve in certain areas of the country or don't devolve into large outbreaks that business should be able to return to normal.But he's also said that widespread testing isn't necessary in those areas because they don't have large caseloads.""We could go to certain states right now that have virtually no problem or a very small problem. We don't have to test the entire state in the middle west or wherever they may be. We don't have to test the entire state. I think it's ridiculous. We don't have to do it"" he said during a briefing at the White House on Wednesday. ""A lot of those states could go back right now and they probably will because at some point in the not-too-distant future certain states are going to come off the rolls.""Ahead of the letter's release Trump discussed the potential new distancing guidelines with governors during a phone call according to a person familiar with the call.On the call Trump reiterated his view that the country needs to reopen soon and that not every place needs to be under the same restrictions. He said certain places had almost no problems with the virus and shouldn't be kept to the same restrictions as areas with high case loads.Some governors on the call thanked Trump for moving away from a nationwide guidance saying it didn't work for their states.But others were less enthusiastic. Trump and Washington State Gov. Jay Inslee got into a heated discussion over Trump's unwillingness to use the Defense Production Act to secure more equipment for states.Inslee told Trump he needed to act as the ""Tom Brady"" of the response effort after Trump said the federal government would act as the ""backup"" for states' own efforts. Trump said the federal government had already done plenty for Washington State.Other governors weren't as combative but did raise some issues with how the federal government has handled the situation including access to tests."
123,Pelosi promises 'strong bipartisan vote' for $2 trillion stimulus in the House,Clare Foran and Haley Byrd,CNN,-1,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/politics/stimulus-coronavirus-pelosi-house-vote/index.html,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday predicted that the House will overwhelmingly approve the $2 trillion stimulus package with a ""strong bipartisan vote"" after the measure passed the Senate late Wednesday night.""I anticipate and feel certain that we will have a strong bipartisan vote"" Pelosi said touting the changes Democrats were able to secure in the final package.LIVE UPDATES: Coronavirus pandemic changes way of lifeThe House is on track to vote on the package on Friday with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer announcing Wednesday evening that the House would convene 9 a.m. ET Friday to consider the relief package.But how they will vote is still uncertain. Many House members are now scrambling to book flights and return to Washington amid concerns that they could be forced to show up in person and vote on the stimulus according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.The legislation was expected to pass by voice vote a move that would allow the House to avoid compelling all of its members to return to Washington for a recorded roll call vote. But Hoyer's office advised members Thursday evening they are encouraged to be in Washington Friday at 10 a.m. because the bill may not pass that way after all. ""There is now a possibility"" the notice from Hoyer's office said that a Republican may force a recorded vote.On a conference call with Democratic members Thursday Pelosi said that if they are unable to pass the bill by voice vote Friday then they would have a roll call vote Friday on final passage according to three sources on the call.Several members told CNN there was ample confusion since Hoyer previously indicated to members that any roll call vote would occur Saturday instead.If a recorded vote is to happen Friday members who want to cast a vote on the historic measure need to get to Washington quickly.""We expect to have a voice vote on it but if we don't we'll be prepared for whatever it is. One way or another with losing no time .. we will be passing the bill tomorrow"" Pelosi said earlier Thursday.Pelosi argued that ""if somebody has a different point of view they can put it in the record"" adding ""but we're not worried about that.""Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky is viewed as the most likely member to try to force the recorded vote after indicating publicly his reservations for letting the bill pass by voice vote. Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York has not ruled out the possibility of asking for the yeas and nays but Democrats don't believe she will.Neither Massie nor Ocasio-Cortez responded to requests for comment Thursday.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said ahead of Friday's vote that he isn't sure how many GOP members will be present for the vote as some members have been infected others are quarantining and still others will have challenges traveling to DC with canceled flights.But he said there will be enough members present to pass the bill on a voice vote -- and he said it would be ""wrong"" for a member of either party to call for a full vote on the floor instead of allowing a voice vote.The Senate approved the massive stimulus package by a unanimous vote of 96-0 on Wednesday evening paving the way for the House to act next. President Donald Trump has indicted he will sign the bill which stands as the largest emergency aid package in US history and the most significant legislative action taken to address the devastating toll the coronavirus has taken on public health and the US economy.Pelosi also made clear that lawmakers will not be done responding to the coronavirus crisis after Congress passes the stimulus package.She said that the ""next step"" will be working to take action on priorities for House Democrats that have not yet been addressed in any of the three legislative packages that have materialized so far including changes for who qualifies for family and medical leave stronger protections for workers boosts for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and more money for state and local governments.Pelosi said House Democrats will ""be taking the lead"" in crafting the next bill but emphasized that negotiations should be carried out by the four corners of House and Senate leadership working together. She said she'll mostly be working from DC and that House committee chairs will be involved in the process.She also suggested that future legislation might include additional direct payments which are one element of the massive stimulus package currently before Congress.""I don't think we've seen the end of direct payments"" she said.Pelosi said in an interview with Bloomberg TV later on Thursday morning that the phase four coronavirus response bill ""will lean toward recovery — how we can create good-paying jobs and to go forward perhaps building the infrastructure of America.""In contrast McCarthy did not sound eager to jump immediately into conversations about a phase four coronavirus response bill.""I wouldn't be so quick to say you have to write something else. Let's let this bill work"" McCarthy said. ""Whatever decision we have to make going forward let's do it with knowledge. Let's do it with the experience of what's on the ground at that moment in time.""""If something is needed in the future let's make that decision but let's not make that decision without allowing these bills to be put into the economy"" he added.The House speaker during her press conference also appeared to push back on Trump's remarks in recent days about limiting social distancing measures by Easter Sunday.""I've said from the start that we must have a proposal that's government-wide science-based so that we can really address the challenge that we face in a scientific evidence-based way. That is not necessarily the course that has been advocated by some but it's where we must be if we're going to end this"" Pelosi said.""We have some of the best minds working 24/7 all hands on deck to find a cure which is of course the light at the end of the tunnel. But if we do not heed the advice of the scientific community about isolation and avoiding as much communal contact as possible — in fact none -- then the light at the end of the tunnel may be a train coming at us"" she warned.""Every day every week that is wasted on not taking that warning seriously is a problem"" she said.This story has been updated Thursday with additional developments."
124,House set to vote Friday on $2 trillion stimulus as coronavirus crisis worsens,Clare Foran Haley Byrd and Manu Raju,CNN,-1,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/27/politics/coronavirus-stimulus-house-vote/index.html,"The House of Representatives on Friday will attempt to approve the historic $2 trillion stimulus package that passed the Senate earlier this week and clear the way for President Donald Trump's signature as the American public and the US economy fight the devastating spread of Covid-19.The far-reaching legislation stands as the largest emergency aid package in US history. It represents a massive financial injection into a struggling economy with provisions aimed at helping American workers small businesses and industries grappling with the economic disruption.Key elements of the package include sending checks directly to individuals and families a major expansion of unemployment benefits money for hard-hit hospitals and health care providers financial assistance for small businesses and $500 billion in loans for distressed companies.House leaders face pressure to pass the legislation as quickly as possible and minimize the risks to their members in the process.Floor debate on the legislation began around 9 a.m. ET with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer saying in his opening remarks that it will be an ""unusual"" but ""critical"" session. There will now be up to three hours of debate ahead of a vote setting up a possible voice vote in the noon ET hour.The bill had been expected to be passed by voice vote a move that would allow for swift passage and was designed to permit most House members not to return to Washington for a full roll call vote. But Hoyer's office advised members Thursday evening they are encouraged to be in Washington on Friday at 10 a.m. because the bill may not pass that way after all. ""There is now a possibility"" the notice from the Maryland Democrat's office said that a Republican may force a recorded vote.Many members were scrambling to book flights and return to Washington on Thursday night amid concerns that they could be asked to vote in person on the stimulus according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.The fear is that one member could prevent the House from approving the bill by voice vote forcing them instead to cast a roll call vote in person. That has angered many members worried about traveling during the public health emergency.Two House members have already tested positive for Covid-19 while more than three dozen others have self-quarantined after experiencing flu-like symptoms interactions with infected individuals or potential exposure.Rep. Pete King a New York Republican tweeted on Friday morning: ""Heading to Washington to vote on pandemic legislation. Because of one Member of Congress refusing to allow emergency action entire Congress must be called back to vote in House. Risk of infection and risk of legislation being delayed. Disgraceful. Irresponsible.""Rep. Dusty Johnson a South Dakota Republican tweeted a picture on a plane with Reps. Pete Stauber a Minnesota Republican and Minnesota Democratic Reps. Angie Craig and Betty McCollum. ""A bipartisan (and socially distanced) flight to DC this morning to vote on Coronavirus economic relief"" Johnson wrote.How the vote will workHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy both made clear on Thursday that they want the $2 trillion stimulus bill to be approved by their chamber Friday by voice vote.But if any member requests a recorded vote lawmakers would have to cast a roll call vote. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky is viewed as the most likely member to try to force the vote after indicating publicly his reservations about a voice vote.Also Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York told CNN on Wednesday that she might force a recorded vote but Democrats don't believe she will.Neither Massie nor Ocasio-Cortez responded to requests for comment Thursday.But Massie told a local radio station Thursday that he's ""having a really hard time"" with the bill and didn't seem too concerned about lawmakers' difficulties in getting back to Washington.""If congressmen are complaining that it's hard to travel well what about the truckers that I saw on the road when I drove to DC? Hitch a ride with the trucker. ... If you're a congressman making $87 an hour and find it hard to get to DC well hitch a ride with the trucker"" Massie said on 55KRC talk radio.On a conference call with Democratic members on Thursday Pelosi said that if they are unable to pass the bill by voice vote they will have a roll call vote Friday according to three sources on the call.Several members told CNN that comment caused confusion since Hoyer previously indicated to members that any roll call vote would occur Saturday.When the House convenes Friday morning there will be time for a debate equally divided between the two sides. Then they will proceed to a voice vote. Once the presiding officer says the ""ayes"" have it the bill will be passed -- unless a member requests a recorded vote.It's unclear how many members will show for Friday's debate and voice vote. It could be very few or it could be a lot; there is no requirement.Pelosi on Thursday predicted that the House will approve the stimulus package with a ""strong bipartisan vote"" adding that ""if somebody has a different point of view they can put it in the record.""""We expect to have a voice vote on it but if we don't we'll be prepared for whatever it is"" she said.McCarthy said at a news conference on Thursday that the House will operate differently than it usually does in order to promote social distancing.He said the members won't sit next each other they'll alter where the members stand and staff will be cleaning as members come and go. He also said that members will have to enter one designated door and leave out the other.""We have members on both sides of the aisle who have the virus. We have members who are quarantined. We have members who have challenges with airlines getting their flights canceled. We will have enough to get this through but the floor will look different"" McCarthy said explaining the modifications that will be made.House officials detailed steps to limit member interactions in a notice to all House offices Thursday.In the notice obtained by CNN the House Sergeant-at-Arms and the Capitol physician's office outlined new procedures ahead of the vote explaining that access around the House chamber and on the floor will be limited. To that end the House is closing the Speaker's Lobby an area right off the House floor where reporters stake out and interview lawmakers and members frequently congregate.If there is a recorded vote new procedures are also detailed to only allow small groups of members on the floor at a time.Hard-fought negotiations led to a massive aid packageThe stimulus package came together after intense and drawn-out negotiations between congressional Republicans and Democrats and the Trump administration that spanned multiple days and involved ongoing talks that stretched late into the night.Democrats initially took issue with the package which was crafted by Senate Republicans at the outset arguing that it put corporations ahead of workers. Partisan tension over the legislation came to a head when Senate Democrats blocked two procedural votes to move ahead with the package on Sunday and again on Monday a setback to the bipartisan efforts to find a consensus deal.A deal was ultimately announced mid-week however paving the way for the Senate to take up and pass the measure.Key provisions in the stimulusA centerpiece of the stimulus package is that it will provide direct financial assistance to Americans in the form of checks with the amount received based on income.Individuals who earn $75000 in adjusted gross income or less would get direct payments of $1200 each with married couples earning up to $150000 receiving $2400 -- and an additional $500 per each child.The payment would scale down by income phasing out entirely at $99000 for singles and $198000 for couples without children.In addition the bill would provide billions of dollars in aid to hard-hit hospitals struggling to deal with the outbreak as well for state and local governments that are cash-strapped due to their response to coronavirus.One point of contention in negotiations centered around a fund for distressed industries with Democrats worrying that there would not be adequate oversight. In a compromise move the final deal provides for accountability through an independent Inspector General and congressional oversight panel.This story has been updated with additional developments Friday."
125,Fact check: Trump utters series of false and misleading claims at coronavirus briefing,Daniel Dale and Tara Subramaniam,CNN,-1,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/politics/fact-check-trump-coronavirus-briefing/index.html,"President Donald Trump who has been regularly dishonest and inaccurate in his remarks about the coronavirus crisis delivered another series of false and misleading claims at the White House coronavirus briefing on Thursday.Here is a preliminary roundup:Gov. Jay Inslee's comments and the mediaTrump denounced ""the fake news"" for a report that Washington Gov. Jay Inslee had clashed with him on a Thursday phone call and had told him that ""we need Tom Brady"" in securing critical medical equipment rather than the ""backup"" Trump had pledged to be -- using the football metaphor to urge the federal government to take a leading role in the effort. (The Washington Post broke the story.)Trump then said that Inslee did make the comment but ""meant it very positively -- but they took it differently."" Trump proceeded to repeat that the reporting was ""only fake news.""Facts First: The reporting on this exchange was not ""fake news."" Trump himself confirmed that Inslee did utter the ""Tom Brady"" quote as did Inslee implicitly (with a joke about it on Twitter). There is no indication that Inslee's remark was meant to be interpreted in a manner substantially different than how the Post and other outlets interpreted it.Inslee declined to discuss the specifics of the call at a Thursday press conference but added ""I think it would be very very helpful if the federal government could be more assertive and aggressive and more organized in helping all of us to obtain these systems.""How unforeseen the coronavirus crisis wasTrump repeated his previous claim that ""this was something that nobody has ever thought could happen to this country."" He added ""Nobody would have ever thought a thing like this could have happened.""Facts First: This is false. The US intelligence community and public health experts had warned for years that the country was at risk from a pandemic. Experts had also warned that the country would face shortages of critical medical equipment such as ventilators if a pandemic occurred.You can read a full fact check here about some of the pandemic warnings. You can read a full fact check here about warnings about the need for additional ventilators in a pandemic.Americans' views on coronavirus-related closuresTrump said ""We have to open up. We can't say 'Let's close.' People don't want to close."" He also said ""People want to go back to work. I'm hearing it loud and clear from everybody."" He added ""This is the United States of America. They don't want to sit around and wait.""Facts First: While there is no polling data on how long Americans want the country's institutions to remain closed it is clear that not ""everybody"" wants workplaces to reopen quickly amid an ongoing pandemic. A poll released on Thursday found that large majorities of Americans say the closure of businesses schools and entertainment activities was necessary to address the pandemic.A Pew Research poll conducted March 19-24 found that 89% of the 11537 US adults surveyed thought the closure of K-12 schools was necessary 91% thought canceling major sports and entertainment events was necessary 85% thought limiting restaurants to carry-out only was necessary and 71% thought requiring most businesses other than grocery stores and pharmacies to close was necessary.A Fox News poll conducted March 21-24 found that 75% of the 1011 registered voters surveyed supported a national ""stay-in-place"" order for everyone other than essential workers.Public health experts have warned that it would be unwise to immediately abandon measures that keep Americans out of physical contact with each other.The trade deficit with ChinaTrump repeated his regular claim that the trade deficit with China used to be $500 billion saying ""$500 billion a year they were taking out. We had trade deficits that were so large nobody has ever seen anything like it.""Facts First: There has never been a $500 billion trade deficit with China. The 2018 deficit was about $381 billion when counting goods and services; the goods and services deficit fell to about $308 billion in 2019. (The deficit with China has not been $500 billion even if you only count trade in goods.)The history of tariffs on ChinaTrump repeated another regular claim about trade and China: ""They're paying us a lot of money in tariffs and other things. They never paid us 10 cents.""Facts First: Study after study has shown that Americans are bearing the cost of the tariffs; Americans make the actual tariff payments. That aside it's not true that the Treasury has never received ""10 cents"" from tariffs on China. The US has had tariffs on China for more than two centuries; FactCheck.org reported that the US generated an ""average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016 according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb.""Mexican troops on the borderTrump repeated his claim that ""we have 27000 Mexican soldiers on our southern border.""Facts First: Mexico has deployed around 27000 troops but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular; Mexico's defense minister said in October that it was about 15000 on the US border about 12000 on Mexico's own southern border."
126,The presidential race isn't on hold -- it's playing out right before us,Jeff Zeleny,CNN,-1,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/politics/2020-campaign-trump-biden-coronavirus/index.html,"The campaign rallies are a distant memory. The final chapter of the primary calendar is awash in uncertainty. The summer political conventions are in doubt.Yet it would be a mistake to think the 2020 presidential race is on hold. In fact it's unfolding right before our eyes.For President Donald Trump the power and the perils of incumbency are on full display as he seeks to steer the nation through a never-before-seen moment in modern America. He's cast himself as a wartime president even as he sends conflicting signals on whether his bigger priority is ending the pandemic or restarting the US economy both of which will now undoubtedly influence his re-election.""It's hard not to be happy with the job we're doing that I can tell you"" Trump said Wednesday in the White House briefing room where he stands before dinnertime most every night to deliver a rosy assessment of the crisis that seldom mentions the rising US death toll overwhelmed hospitals and cries for help from doctors nurses and local leaders.Seven months before Election Day the President is working overtime to build a glowing narrative about his administration's coronavirus response.His rally-like rhetoric from the White House may be paying dividends -- for now at least -- as a new CNN Poll of Polls on Friday showed more Americans view Trump's handling of the crisis through a positive light. The average of five national surveys released this week shows that his approval rating on handling coronavirus is 52% while his disapproval stands at 45%. His overall approval rating average is higher than at any point of his presidency.It's an open question whether those early reviews represent more of a rallying effect which presidents often experience during times of national emergency or if the support will endure after the true scope of the deadly outbreak is fully known.Joe Biden and his advisers are racing to compete with Trump's megaphone and his often self-congratulatory version of events which routinely clash with the truth. The Biden team is working to adapt to the new realities of a campaign playing out in a nation under quarantine isolation and fear.""I don't care whether the president's numbers are going up and down"" Biden said Wednesday. ""I know along with anybody else who's ever dealt with these kinds of things like we did in our administration that time is of the essence. Time is of the essence.""Speaking from his home in Delaware where aides built a basement television studio Biden took pains not to overtly politicize the coronavirus spread. He even said he would welcome a strong approval rating for Trump if it pushed the White House to provide needed assistance to cities and states.""I hope that he's so strong that he's up way above that because we need the help now"" Biden said. ""We need help now.""The urgent empathy in Biden's voice underscored the uncertainty and fragility of this moment. While he has remained largely above the political fray his campaign has pushed back aggressively against Trump as his outside allies have launched a multi-million dollar ad campaign highlighting how the White House downplayed the crisis for weeks.The primary campaign may be frozen in time with several states postponing elections until June and Bernie Sanders staying in the race even though Biden has built a nearly insurmountable lead in delegates. But the general election has already begun a contest that is remarkably more complicated in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.'This campaign can't be on hold'The events of the coming weeks could shape the race for months to come several Democratic strategists say arguing the party cannot afford to cede this moment to Trump or allow Republicans to derisively define Biden while he is striving to put the crisis above politics.""This campaign can't be on hold"" said Robby Mook who ran Hillary Clinton's race against Trump in 2016. ""This is the campaign.""Facing the biggest challenge of his presidency Trump had been missing something he relishes: an enemy to vilify. Now he's taken to blaming China for inflicting pain on the world and has returned to lashing out at the media to portray himself as a victim to his supporters.To Mook it's a familiar pattern that he saw slowly unfold four years ago.""People see 2016 as this crazy fluke which it was in many ways"" Mook said. ""But that's missing the bigger point that Trump has a way of owning what we're talking about and grinding in a set of doubts about his opponent. He projects his greatest weaknesses on his opponent -- and I see that happening again.""Matt Rhoades the campaign manager for Mitt Romney's race against Barack Obama in 2012 said the power of incumbency was one of the strongest tools in Trump's arsenal. While sitting presidents may own the problems that took place during their term he said they also have an unparalleled ability to control the conversation.""This is why it's so difficult to beat an incumbent president. Never underestimate the reach the power and the strength of a Rose Garden strategy"" said Rhoades who also worked on President George W. Bush's reelection campaign in 2004. ""I'd rather own the problem and be in charge and take action to fix it than be the person on the sidelines screaming fire.""The Biden team is steadily preparing to wage a battle for which there is no playbook with a former vice president not accustomed to being on the sidelines of power after spending nearly a half-century in the Senate or the White House.""I'm chomping at the bit"" Biden said. ""I wish I were still in the Senate you know being able to impact some of these things but I am where I am and I hope to be the nominee of the Democratic Party and I hope I'm able to get my message across as we go forward.""But it remains to be seen how successful he will be in projecting that message.His aides have rushed to adapt to the rapidly-changing environment installing the television studio launching a podcast and increasing his visibility -- all from his Delaware basement as he like much of America is working from home.A central issueA campaign once thought to be waged over the future of health care economic fairness and America's place in the world is now revolving around something else: The administration's response to coronavirus and the economic collapse. How the nation recovers by November will be a key metric for voters.In the president's mind a robust economy was always his best ticket to winning a second term. Fears of a recession are now driving his push to accelerate the opening of businesses across the country by Easter despite protests from health experts many leading Republicans and nearly all Democrats about the wisdom of doing so.""I don't think it's going to end up being such a rough patch especially if we can open -- the sooner the better"" Trump said Wednesday. ""It's going to open up like a rocket ship.""That of course remains to be seen.While presidential campaigns often do not end on the same issues in which they began -- in 2008 for example a campaign driven by opposition to the Iraq war ended on the economic crash -- it's almost certain the coronavirus outbreak will be a central issue in the 2020 race.But for the next seven months this race has little precedent in American history.Although the country is enduring a moment of national challenge and sacrifice Trump has done very little to inspire the unity that emerged in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11 2001 when Democrats and Republicans initially rallied together in common purpose.""Nothing really quite equals what we're dealing with here"" said Douglas Brinkley a CNN presidential historian and professor at Rice University. ""The public health crisis and health care in general are going to be a flagship issue of 2020.""How prepared the Trump administration was for the coronavirus outbreak he said is almost certain to be a central issue in the campaign along with its competence and readiness for other types of calamities.One of the biggest unknown factors he said is whether traditional campaigning will resume by summer or fall or if the candidates will turn to alternatives. A century ago a handful of presidents relied on ""front-porch campaigns"" where they declined to do big rallies and won by simply staying close to the White House.In this modern-day contest Brinkley said perhaps it would become a virtual front-porch campaign.""They will seem to be everywhere but they may be on your television set or phone"" Brinkley said. ""You may never see them in person or experience one of their rallies.""For now the campaign is not playing out in critical battleground states across the country but rather with Trump at his post in the White House briefing room and Biden settling into his television studio in the basement of his home about 120 miles away in Delaware.This story has been updated with additional poll data."
127,Many House members coming back to Washington in anticipation of vote on coronavirus stimulus,Manu Raju,CNN,-1,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/politics/house-members-traveling-back-to-washington/index.html,"Many House members are scrambling to book flights and return to Washington amid concerns that they could be requested to show up in person and vote on the historic stimulus bill infuriating lawmakers who are nervous about traveling during the coronavirus crisis.The fear is that one member -- potentially GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky -- could prevent the House from approving the $2 trillion bill by voice vote forcing them instead to cast a roll-call vote in person. That has angered many members who are now forced to decide whether to skip a vote on the biggest rescue package in American history -- or travel to Washington and risk their personal well-being.On a conference call Thursday many House Democrats expressed deep concerns about traveling worried about contracting the virus and spreading it to their families sources on the call said.Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that if they are unable to pass the bill by voice vote then they would have a roll call vote on final passage on Friday according to three sources on the call.Several members told CNN that comment caused confusion since House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer previously indicated to members that any roll-call vote would occur Saturday instead. That means members who want to cast a vote on the historic measure need to show up on Friday to have their position recorded. A voice vote would allow fewer members to be present.Hoyer's office said Thursday night that members are encouraged to be in Washington by 10 a.m. ET and that the $2 trillion economic stimulus bill may not pass by a voice vote because there is ""now a possibility that a House Republican may suggest a quorum is not present and attempt to call for a recorded vote on final passage. We have notified our Members of the possibility that the bill may not pass by voice vote.""Any member can request a recorded vote forcing members to vote in person.The floor debate will go on for up to two hours starting at 9 a.m. ET Friday.Massie a libertarian-minded Republican who often breaks from his party leadership is viewed as the most likely member to try to force the vote after indicating publicly his reservations at the idea of letting the bill pass by a voice vote. Massie told a local radio station Thursday that he's ""having a really hard time"" with the bill and didn't seem too concerned about lawmakers' difficulties in getting back to Washington.""If congressmen are complaining that it's hard to travel well what about the truckers that I saw on the road when I drove to DC? Hitch a ride with the trucker. ... If you're a congressman making $87 an hour and find it hard to get to DC well hitch a ride with the trucker"" Massie said on 55KRC talk radio.Democrats believe their members won't take that step.Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a New York Democrat told CNN on Wednesday that she might force a recorded vote but Democrats don't believe she will.Neither Massie nor Ocasio-Cortez responded to requests for comment Thursday.On that Thursday call Pelosi made clear her strong opposition to any attempt by a lawmaker to force House members to return to Washington for the vote saying such a move would be ""inexcusable"" and amount to ""selfishness"" according to two sources on the call.Pelosi along with Hoyer and a number of other rank-and-file members were blunt about their preference for the vote to occur by voice Friday rather than an in-person roll-call vote.Several members expressed concerns about traveling amid the coronavirus pandemic noting they have health issues or live with someone with health concerns. Others noted their challenges in traveling back to Washington. At least 10 members expressed their concerns on the call noting that the bill will pass regardless so it makes little sense to potentially endanger members' health or their families' health one of the sources said.Even though the federal government is urging New Yorkers who are leaving the metro area to self-quarantine for two weeks members from the state will be at the Capitol today.Rep. Pete King a New York Republican tweeted Friday morning: ""Heading to Washington to vote on pandemic legislation. Because of one Member of Congress refusing to allow emergency action entire Congress must be called back to vote in House. Risk of infection and risk of legislation being delayed. Disgraceful. Irresponsible.""This story has been updated with comments from a radio interview with Massie."
128,Doctors disagree with White House adviser's statement that media is hyping need for protective equipment,Paul LeBlanc,CNN,-1,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/politics/coronavirus-doctors-white-house/index.html,"Multiple health care workers on Thursday debunked a statement from a White House adviser that the media is overstating the need for personal protective equipment in hospitals amid the novel coronavirus pandemic.Their comments come after White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told CNN earlier Thursday the media should ""not sensationalize this crisis"" when asked about shortages in personal protective equipment.""So please as you report this crisis please keep in mind the extent that that is done makes our job here harder"" Navarro told CNN's Brianna Keilar. ""And it makes the health care professional job harder.""Yet health care professionals repeatedly refuted those comments stressing the dire need for personal protective equipment for front-line medical staff as the outbreak spreads.Speaking to CNN's Jake Tapper later Thursday Dr. Lisa Dabby an emergency medicine physician said ""We appreciate the media's support.""""There really needs to be a push right now for production of PPE. We really need to keep our health care workers our front line safe and healthy"" she said. ""People need to realize when they get sick they're going to want somebody to take care of them.""""People need know what's happening behind the scenes"" she added.Those comments were echoed by Dr. James Phillips an assistant professor of emergency medicine at George Washington University and CNN medical analyst who told Tapper there's ""a very significant need across the country"" for personal protective equipment.""It's important for the American public to understand and for the folks in politics to understand as well that we are already receiving guidance from the CDC on how to reuse our PPE. That is a deviation from the standard of care. Normally in what we would call conventional care we would wear a different mask for every single patient"" he said.""But we're already being asked to use those for multiple patients if not multiple days. That is a significant deviation from the standard. If we had enough equipment we would wear one mask per patient as it has been recommended for decades.""Phillips added: ""So the idea that we have enough PPE across the country is just not true.""Their comments come as the US now has the highest number of known cases of coronavirus in the world with more than 82000 according to CNN's tally of cases reported by health officials.The grim milestone comes just as US officials reported a new high for fatalities reported in a single day. At least 237 deaths were reported Thursday bringing the total number of deaths nationwide to at least 1195.The spike of cases has hospitals around the country scrambling to keep up with the demand for care.CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said Thursday that while some hospitals have enough equipment ""for the next few days"" many hospital systems around the country ""went through their entire season's supply of this stuff in a few days.""""Once you start losing health care workers that's what's really going to make a significant negative effect on mortality in this country"" Gupta said. ""But also they're the ones doing the work. They're the ones actually taking care of patients. It's amazing."""
129,The Top 10 women Joe Biden might pick as VP,Chris Cillizza,CNN,-1,https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/politics/joe-biden-kamala-harris-elizabeth-warren-amy-klobuchar/index.html,"Former Vice President Joe Biden made the quadrennial guessing game of who he might pick to be his own vice president much easier when during a CNN debate earlier this month he pledged that he would be choosing a woman as his second-in-command.Which narrows our cast of characters significantly!Of his process Biden said this on ""The View"" on Tuesday:""Well we are gonna start vetting soon and there are -- there is a short list meaning somewhere between -- there's about 12 to 15 women who I think would be qualified to be president tomorrow.""But I think we're gonna narrow the list down to about 11.""So who will he pick? That's where I come in! Below I've ranked the 10 people who are the most likely to be the selection come this summer. This is obviously an early list -- and names will come on and off the list as well as move up and down it. So if you don't see your favorite here don't fret! I'll be releasing new rankings every week or two -- as news dictates.(Note: Biden isn't the nominee officially yet. But his lead over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is significant enough that he is already turning to consideration of his VP. Don't believe me? Read this.)Here we go!10. Michelle Lujan Grisham: Lujan Grisham was elected governor in 2018 after spending six years in the House representing New Mexico. She's one of the least well-known politicians on this list but the female Latina governor of a southwestern state has a long history of working in government having worked on health and aging issues in New Mexico prior to coming to Washington.9. Keisha Lance Bottoms: The mayor of Atlanta was with Biden from (almost) the start. (She endorsed him in June 2019.) And stuck with him through some very very rocky times in the fight for the nomination emerging as one of his most active and effective surrogates. At 50 she is also a nice generational break from the 77-year old Biden.8. Tammy Baldwin: Don't know Baldwin? She's the first openly gay person elected (and re-elected) to the Senate and happens to represent perhaps the swingiest of Midwestern swing states: Wisconsin. Biden and his team have to look at the 55% with which Baldwin won a second term in 2018 and be impressed/intrigued.7. Stacey Abrams: Abrams who came within a whisker of becoming the first black female governor in the country in 2018 is a name that often comes up as a finalist for Biden's VP. It makes sense: She is a high-profile African American woman who showed that a winning coalition (or pretty darn close) in a longtime Republican stronghold in the south. I'm slightly more skeptical. Remember that Abrams blanched at the idea of being Biden's VP when it was floated earlier in the cycle.6. Tammy Duckworth: Duckworth is someone who I think will see her stock rise as the VP vetting process goes along. Her personal story is incredible and compelling -- badly wounded in Iraq when the Blackhawk helicopter she was piloting was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. Duckworth lost both legs and the full use of her right arm in the incident. She was elected to the House from Illinois in 2012 and the Senate in 2016 -- becoming the second Asian American woman in the Senate. All of that plus her Midwestern appeal makes her an appealing pick.5. Catherine Cortez Masto: The Nevada senator has two main things going for her -- she's from a swing state and she is currently the chair of Senate Democrats' campaign arm (which means she is known to major Democratic donors). Cortez Masto is also likely to have an influential voice in her corner: Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid whose seat she now holds.4. Gretchen Whitmer: Whitmer isn't as well-known a name as the three women in front of her on this list but if you are looking for a bit of a dark horse to the Biden shortest list my money is on the Michigan governor. Whitmer endorsed Biden days before his critical win over Sanders in the March 10 campaign and was named a national campaign co-chair. She's a rapid rising star within the party -- she gave the Democratic response to President Donald Trump's State of the Union speech this year -- and represents a state Biden must take back from the President.3. Elizabeth Warren: Unlike the two women in front of her in these rankings Warren has yet to endorse Biden's campaign -- despite the fact that it's been clear for at least two weeks that he will be the nominee. That won't be the deciding factor in whether the Massachusetts senator is the pick or not but it could tilt the scales slightly against her. The Warren pick has a very clear motivation: Ensure the liberal base of the party (or at least a big chunk of it) is behind the Democratic ticket.2. Amy Klobuchar: Klobuchar and Biden are very similar in their approach to politics: Pragmatists who never let the perfect get in the way of the good. And the Minnesota senator proved herself an able debater (and candidate) during this campaign more than able to hold her own among a group of better known pols. Klobuchar has also run and won in the Midwest which is shaping up to be the battleground (again) in November.1. Kamala Harris: The California senator makes the most sense for a lot of reasons. She would be a historic pick as the first African American and Indian American woman on a national ticket. She and Biden have a personal connection through the former vice president's late son Beau who was friendly with Harris when they were both state attorneys general. And at 55 years old Harris offers Biden a good mix between seasoned politician and a younger ticket-mate who would be ready to step in after 4 or 8 years."

132,Ridley Scott on coronavirus: Trump is a 'nutcase',Catherine Shoard,The Guardian,-1,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/27/ridley-scott-coronavirus-donald-trump-nutcase-boris-johnson-rationing,Ridley Scott the director of Alien Blade Runner Gladiator and The Martian has taken aim at Donald Trump and Boris Johnson over their leadership during the coronavirus pandemic.Speaking to Variety from his home in Los Angeles Scott 82 said he thought “this orange-headed fellow that’s running us” is “a nutcase isn’t he”?Looking more widely Scott suggested that half the world’s leaders were “idiots” and the other half “despots”. “There are very few worthwhile ones” he said. “If anyone has half a brain they wouldn’t want to go into politics anyway right?”Scott who was born shortly before the second world war suggested that countries the UK in particular should reintroduce rationing because “people are buying so much food and then the food is rotting”.He continued: “Jesus Boris get out your thinking cap cos what we’re now talking on is an iPhone: a perfect coupon distributor to limit what you can buy each time you go to the shops. And that way you have order. You must have order and calm.”At the time of the shutdown Scott was shooting The Last Duel a drama set in medieval France starring Matt Damon and Ben Affleck. He remains hopeful filming can resume later this year.Scott also said the disparity in the quality of coronavirus coverage across the US news networks was “insane”.“I still think CNN’s the best and they are in dismay at how it’s not being handled properly.”Scott reiterated the advice for people to remain in their own homes saying: “It’ll be an experience of mild to severe flu for most people and old geezers like me have gotta watch my back.”
133,Did a New York Times article inspire Trump's 'back to work' plan?,Adam Gabbatt,The Guardian,-1,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/trump-coronavirus-back-to-work-column,At the start of this week as millions were following US government advice to combat the coronavirus pandemic by physical distancing and staying indoors Donald Trump abruptly declared that people needed to soon return to work.“At a certain point we have to get open and we have to get moving. We don’t want to lose these companies. We don’t want to lose these workers” Trump said at a White House press conference. Trump said this was going to happen “very soon”.The policy of returning to normal nearly all epidemiologists warn carries a threat of catastrophe: of allowing the virus to spread just as the measures proven to curb it are starting to work.So where did Trump’s U-turn come from?As frequently is the case with Trump’s political ideas he seems to have been inspired – at least in part – by Fox News and also by thinkpieces popular among conservatives but often not written by epidemiologists.On Sunday the Fox News host Steve Hilton railed against the idea of long-term social distancing. Hilton claimed “working Americans” will be “crushed” by an indefinite work shutdown. Hilton mused that there could be a situation where “the cure is worse than the disease”.Within hours the Fox News message found its intended target. On Sunday evening Trump tweeted mangling Hilton’s words slightly: “WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF.”The idea of sending people back to work and restarting the economy had been floating around last weekend propagated by two opinion pieces in particular. One was written on Medium. Another published two days before the Hilton show was an opinion piece by David Katz a former director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center which was published by the New York Times. Given the reach of the New York Times this piece headlined Is Our Fight Against Coronavirus Worse Than the Disease? attracted huge attention.In the piece Katz argues that those over 60 and those who are immunologically compromised should be “preferentially protect[ed]” with focused testing.“This focus on a much smaller portion of the population would allow most of society to return to life as usual and perhaps prevent vast segments of the economy from collapsing” Katz wrote adding that then children could return to school and adults return to their jobs.In time people would develop immunity to the coronavirus and in the meantime damage to the economy would be minimized Katz opined.But as many pointed out Katz is not an epidemiologist. Instead he specializes in nutrition advice and has published a number of dietary books including The Way to Eat Cut Your Cholesterol and Stealth Health.Katz’s piece was shared widely among conservatives including by Fox News host and informal Trump adviser Pete Hegseth. The article served as a handy tool for conservatives advancing the argument that the economy shouldn’t be sacrificed for coronavirus containment.A group of Yale epidemiologists swiftly wrote a letter to the Times rebutting Katz’s piece. Others pointed out Katz’s lack of credentials and his links to big industry. He was once paid $3500 an hour as an expert witness in a Chobani legal case to defend the sugar contained in its yoghurts.Katz has received hundreds of thousands of dollars from companies including Hershey’s Kind Bars the walnut industry and Quaker Oats. The science journalist Nina Teicholz has written about how in some cases Katz wrote positive articles about those companies after receiving grants.“Dr Katz’s efforts on behalf of public health during this pandemic are uncompensated and born from a sense of duty and commitment to public health” a spokeswoman for Katz told the Guardian. She pointed to a post Katz wrote on LinkedIn following the criticism where he stresses how damage to the economy is also a massive public health issue.Yale itself went to lengths to distance itself from Katz. “David Katz is not academically affiliated with Yale and has not held an academic appointment here since 2016” the university posted on Twitter.Gregg Gonsalves an assistant epidemiology at the Yale school of public health said: “Yes the elderly are at risk. But the ability to sequester safely for months on end in the United States is untenable. We don’t have a social safety net that maybe continental European countries have.”He said: “The other thing is low risk doesn’t mean no risk. We don’t know the natural history of the disease well enough to say: ‘Everybody under 65 is A-OK and ready to go back to work.’”Katz’s piece wasn’t the sole inspiration for Trump’s change of mind. The influential Fox News host Laura Ingraham and others eagerly shared a Medium article written by a tech worker named Aaron Ginn over the weekend which advances some of the same ideas as Katz.Medium later took the article down after widespread criticism including from experts in infectious diseases.The concept of trading off self-isolation for returning to normal to help the economy has also been pushed by Trump’s cabinet including his economic adviser Larry Kudlow who on Tuesday told reporters: “Public health includes economic health.”The arguments advanced by Katz and others however are a piece of a movement which could lead to Trump flip-flopping again on the seriousness of the coronavirus – which could be problematic for all.
134,How US governors are fighting coronavirus – and Donald Trump,Daniel Strauss,The Guardian,-1,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/us-governors-coronavirus-trump,America’s state governors have found themselves under an intense national spotlight in response to the coronavirus pandemic.The additional scrutiny has also highlighted an evolving dynamic between these chief executives who operate the country’s states and a White House run by a mercurial president whose public statements and policy turns are often impossible to predict.As the virus crisis has grown stronger governors’ daily press conferences and media calls on the coronavirus have become primetime events for a worried and often fearful populace. Governors the typically aloof top state officials are currently some of the most reliable sources of information on confirmed coronavirus cases and updates on medical supplies in response to the virus.“The governors are acting in a way governors traditionally act it just so happens that governors have more of an audience for it now” said the former Delaware governor Jack Markell a Democrat.Responses to the pandemic have varied from state to state. Partially because not every governor has the same amount of authority. Some governors can activate the national guard or order schools closed essentially on their own. Others have had to take legislative routes or make other bureaucratic moves.There have been some markings of a deeper ideological divide to responding to the virus. Some Republican governors such as Arizona’s Doug Ducey have loudly touted new partnerships with private business to fight the pandemic while some Democrats have leaned more on executive orders to slow the outbreak down.Governors have also received more attention from Donald Trump than they otherwise would.New York’s governor Andrew Cuomo a Democrat has received both praise and criticism from the president. Cuomo has regularly been in touch with Trump but at times criticized the federal government’s help to his state. Illinois’ governor JB Pritzker and Michigan’s governor Gretchen Whitmer  have gotten into public spats with Trump on Twitter.At the same time Republican and Democratic governors are learning how to shape their public comments under the intense scrutiny of a TV-obsessed president eager to return praise and respond to criticism with more criticism. It is a tough tightrope to walk and in the face of dealing with a pandemic comes with life-or-death high stakes.California’s governor Gavin Newsom usually an eager critic of the president has repeatedly praised the Trump administration for how it has responded to the crisis. Newsom has praised Trump for the president’s “focus on treatments”.California’s governor Gavin Newsom speaks in Rancho Cordova California on 23 March.FacebookTwitterPinterest California’s governor Gavin Newsom speaks in Rancho Cordova California on 23 March. Photograph: Rich Pedroncelli/APConversely Pritzker found himself in a Twitter feud with the president where at one point the top Illinois Democrat called Trump a carnival barker. Trump has also fumed at Washington’s governor Jay Inslee calling him a “snake”.“It’s a two-way street” Trump said of dealing with governors during a Fox News town hall. “They have to treat us well.”There’s been an increased level of coordination and note trading between governors as well. Usually each governor is mostly siloed off from even their closest neighbors. But conference calls with the White House or one-on-one calls and joint statements between governors have become more regular. We’ve just started texting and calling each other as we look to [ask] ‘Why did you do this? What was the thought process?'Kansas’ governor Laura Kelly“There is a lot of chatter amongst governors” said Kansas’ governor Laura Kelly a Democrat in an interview with the Guardian. “We’ve just started texting and calling each other as we look to [ask] ‘Why did you do this? What was the thought process behind this?’ as we’re trying to make decisions for our own states.”The National Governors Association the nonpartisan umbrella organization has helped to facilitate conference calls between the governors and a White House. The Democratic Governors Association and the Republican Governors Association have been sharing information about what governors have been doing on the pandemic with their members.A call between Florida’s governor Ron DeSantis and Georgia’s governor Brian Kemp on Covid-19 was listed on DeSantis’s public schedule in mid-March. Whitmer a Democrat and Ohio’s Republican governor Mike DeWine issued a joint statement urging Trump to take extra steps to protect the auto industry from financial ruin during the pandemic and resulting economic collapse.The White House has been interacting with governors regularly. South Dakota’s governor Kristi Noem talked extensively with Larry Kudlow the director of Trump’s National Economic Council on Wednesday. On Thursday the Trump administration released a letter sent to every governor detailing how it planned to release new guidelines for classifying counties as “high-risk” “medium-risk” or “low-risk” on the coronavirus. The Trump administration has regularly held conference calls with governors.According to a Republican aide to one of the governors on those calls oftentimes the calls start out with “Vice-President Mike Pence giving an update on what the latest is that’s going on on a federal level”. Then Dr Deborah Birx the response coordinator for the Trump administration’s coronavirus taskforce will give a medical update on the virus. Then governors are free to ask questions. The calls have been cordial and fairly non combative. There was another one on Thursday and one planned for next week.“It really probably more than anything continues to be a discussion about supply chains and quantities” Kelly said. “I think every governor is experiencing a problem with that. A problem with getting tests done and getting test results back.”As governors have enjoyed additional national and local attention New York’s Cuomo has received an outsized amount. That’s partially because New York has been one of the most hardest hit locations of the virus. He has seen more press than any other governor even ones being mentioned as possible presidential candidates in 2024.“Quite honestly he has done a wonderful job of communicating and keeping people informed” Kelly said. She pointed out that New York has really been a “hotbed” for the virus and that “it’s such a huge driver of all things American – it’s our financial sector it’s all sorts of things”.Elsewhere there has been an unusual level of agreement among governors. In the community of governors there’s a growing bipartisan level of skepticism about that the US could reopen by Easter as Trump is hoping for. Asked if that’s feasible Kelly said: “No and I think it’s very unhelpful to even say those things.”Similarly during a press conference on Thursday Noem when pressed doubted that her state would be back to normal soon.“I do not think South Dakota will be back to normal for many months – many months” Noem said.
135,US surpasses China for highest number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the world,David Smith,The Guardian,-1,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-outbreak-us-latest-trump,Donald Trump again struggled to reassure a fearful nation on Thursday as it emerged the US now has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the world.News that America had surpassed virus hotspots China and Italy with 82404 cases of infection according to a tracker run by Johns Hopkins University broke as the president was holding a press conference at the White House.His instinctive response was to question other countries’ statistics. “It’s a tribute to the amount of testing that we’re doing” Trump told reporters. “We’re doing tremendous testing and I’m sure you’re not able to tell what China is testing or not testing. I think that’s a little hard.”Trump later spoke to the Chinese president Xi Jinping by telephone and had what he described on Twitter as a “very good conversation”. The two leaders discussed the coronavirus in “great detail” adding that: “China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!”Donald J. Trump✔@realDonaldTrumpJust finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China. Discussed in great detail the CoronaVirus that is ravaging large parts of our Planet. China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!221K1:19 AM - Mar 27 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy76.3K people are talking about thisWhile the US has increased its testing capacity in recents days the process has been flawed and incoherent and the country still lags behind leaders such as South Korea in terms of the number of tests administered per-capita.On a grim day the death toll in America surpassed 1000 and it was revealed that last week 3.3 million people filed for unemployment – the biggest single-week jump in history. The president has been widely condemned for failing to act fast enough misjudging the public mood and seeking to blame others rather than taking personal responsibility.“It’s nobody’s fault” Trump said of the jobless figure. “Certainly not in this country. Nobody’s fault. We got very lucky when we made a decision not to allow people in from China on a very early date. I say that because some people don’t want to accept it but this was a great decision made by our country or the numbers that you’re talking about – we’re a big country – they’d be far greater far bigger.”He added: “I heard it could be six million could be seven million. It’s 3.3 or 3.2 but it’s a lot of jobs but I think we’ll come back very strong. The sooner we get back to work – you know every day we stay out it gets harder to bring it back very quickly and our people don’t want to stay out ... I think you’ll see a very fast turnaround once we have a victory over the hidden enemy.”Trump told the briefing that dates for reopening sections of the country were under discussion but he notably did not refer to Easter – 12 April – as he has been pushing in recent days.Critics have long accused him of lacking compassion pointing to examples such as when in 2017 he lobbed paper towels at hurricane survivors in Puerto Rico. On Thursday he was asked about the thousands of restaurants going out of business causing personal devastation to owners and staff.“I understand the restaurant business” he claimed describing it as “very delicate”. He went on: “You can serve 30 great meals to a person and a family ... one bad meal 31 and they never come back again. It’s a very tough business.”He added: “It may not be the same restaurant it may not be the same ownership but they’ll all be back.”Even as New York hospitals become overwhelmed with doctors complaining of nightmarish conditions and cases spike in cities such as New Orleans Trump continued to talk down the threat from the virus. “Many people have it. I just spoke to two people that had it. They never went to a doctor they didn’t report it ... The people that actually die that percentage is much lower than I actually thought.”He added “The mortality rate in my opinion is way down” even though experts have warned that this is likely to worsen in the coming weeks.In a tone that again seemed at odds with the gravity of the situation Trump asked a reporter from Bloomberg News “How’s Michael doing good?” – a reference to the failed presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg – and dismissed a state governor who took part in a conference call as a “wise guy”.He also said he will speak by phone with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping later on Thursday claiming they have a “very good relationship”. The president has repeatedly used the phrase “Chinese virus” angering some in that country.“No it came from China” he said but he added “if they feel so strongly about it we’ll see.”Confirmed cases of Covid-19 for selected countriesShowing the number of cases since the day of the 100th case using a log scale. Data correct at 23.59 UTC 26 MarchVice-president Mike Pence and Deborah Birx response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force also sought to calm fears about a shortage of ventilators despite media reports to the contrary.Birx said of New York: “To wake up this morning and look at people talking about creating DNR situations Do-Not-Resuscitate situations for patients – there is no situation in the United States right now that warrants that kind of discussion.”There was some silver lining for Trump on Thursday as stocks rallied on Wall Street for that day after a historic $2tn economic rescue package won passage in the Senate. The plan which is expected to be voted on in the House of Representatives on Friday would distribute $1200 per adult and $500 per child.Joe Biden the front runner in the Democratic presidential race said: “The president is not responsible for the coronavirus but he bears full responsibility for the slow and uncoordinated response that has exacerbated both the public health and economic impact on our country. The harsh reality is that at least 3 million people now don’t have jobs because our president didn’t do his job when it mattered.”
136,Coronavirus US live: US now has more cases than any other country – as it happened,Maanvi Singh Lauren Gambino Tom Lutz,The Guardian,-1,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-us-live-house-vote-2tn-stimulus-package-bill-senate-news-updates-trump,30m ago10:03Live reporting on the coronavirus in the US continues on Friday’s blog:14h ago20:21SummaryThe US has surpassed China and Italy with more than 82000 cases per Johns Hopkins’ tally. A lack of early action and setbacks in testing could be to blame. During a Coronavirus Task Force briefing Donald Trump expressed skepticism at the news that the US was worst hit by the pandemic accusing China of sharing false data.Trump continued to push the idea that the US could revise physical distancing guidelines within two weeks despite warnings from public health experts that doing so would have disastrous consequences. He said more guidance would come next week but for now he told Americans to “stay home just relax stay home.”During the briefing Dr. Deborah Birx — who is leading the US response to the coronavirus pandemic. — said reports that hospitals were running out of beds and ventilators and considering “do not resuscitate” protocols were irresponsible. She provided an optimistic assessment of the crisis and indicated that predictions that 20 to 60 or 70% of Americans would contract the virus did not match. conditions “on the ground”. But her rosy outlook was somewhat at odds with what public health experts and hospitals have been reporting so far.The US labor department announced that a record 3.3 million people filed claims for unemployment. The Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the US may very well be headed into a recession. Lawmakers said the emergency economic relief package that passed the Senate last night will help.Nancy Pelosi is “certain” that the House will pass the $2tn stimulus package that was approved by the Senate last night. With 435 members there are some logistical challenges to ensuring the vote is carried out in adherence to social distancing guidelines.FacebookTwitter14h ago20:14The Guardian’s Vivian Ho reports:California’s homeless census was already troubled. Covid-19 is making it impossible.For the past year and a half local county census committees and homeless service providers throughout California have been conducting their own outreach for the 2020 census knowing that only an accurate count of the state’s growing homeless population will guarantee the federal funding needed to get people off the streets and into stability.Because even before the US coronavirus crisis prompted shelter-in-place orders and the suspension of 2020 census field operations nationwide casting doubt on the operations for the once-in-a-decade count they were preparing for the federal Census Bureau to significantly undercount the homeless population.While homelessness has soared particularly in California census staffers said plans in place to count the population were insufficient and disorganized. The federal bureau had limited the hours of targeted counting to between midnight and 7am. There was little or varied communication around cultural facilitation led by service providers or homeless representatives who act as a guide for enumerators to smooth the process. Two weeks from 1 April census day when thousands of enumerators were set to flood the streets to conduct the count some field offices were still not fully staffed.15h ago19:42Experts say economic relief package is a start - but not enoughAdvocates for American workers praised a “historic” increase in unemployment benefits included in an emergency $2tn relief package approved by the US Senate which will offer special “pandemic unemployment” to gig workers self-employed workers and some people forced to leave their jobs because of the coronavirus crisis.But although the unemployment payments will offer months of support to many vulnerable Americans advocates said that the bill threatens to leave too many people out. Even $2tn in emergency aid experts said is probably too little for the size of the crisis.As part of the unprecedented relief package approved by the Senate on Wednesday night millions of Americans would get an individual $1200 check to help them weather the economic crisis caused by the pandemic. The bill would also create a $500bn lending program for businesses cities and states and a $367bn fund for small businesses which would focus on helping small businesses to pay their employees’ salaries through the next weeks of pandemic-related shutdowns rather than laying them off.The bill’s major benefit to American workers is not that single cash payment but the sweeping expansion of unemployment benefits labor experts said. The bill offers laid-off workers an additional $600 a week for four months and extends unemployment benefits to gig workers independent contractors and others who have not previously been eligible for unemployment including people forced to leave their jobs to care for family members with coronavirus or to care for children whose schools have closed.15h ago19:22Florida poll workers test positive for coronavirusThe Guardian’s Sam Levine reports:Two Florida poll workers tested positive for coronavirus after the state’s March 17 primary the Broward County supervisor of elections announced Thursday.The announcement came after Florida faced criticism for moving ahead in-person voting despite concerns over coronavirus. Around 20% of the state is age 65 or older a demographic extremely vulnerable to the virus.The two poll workers worked at separate locations in Hollywood Florida. One was at the Martin Luther King Community Center and the other at the David Park Community Center. One of the poll workers also worked at a location in Weston during early voting.”County staff as well as other poll workers at those locations have been notified of the situation and have been advised to take appropriate steps” the Broward County supervisor of elections said in a statement. “Voters who voted in person on March 17th at either of those locations or who voted early at the Weston early voting location may wish to take appropriate steps and seek medical advice.”15h ago19:14Fact check:Dr. Birx also commented that because 19 out of 50 states had had fewer than 200 cases “that’s almost 40% of the country with extraordinarily low numbers” she said. Of course 19 states with low population density don’t account for 40% of the US population.About 103200 tests have been conducted in the US according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But tests are normally administered to people who are already showing symptoms or are at high risk of complications from the disease.FacebookTwitter15h ago19:04Fact check:Dr. Birx also said that with some “creative” thinking hospitals could find beds for coronavirus patients.But communities across the country have expressed that they do not have the capacity to treat a surge of coronavirus patients. California officials have said the state may need up to 50000 more beds and New York hospitals have been transferring patients without coronavirus to other hospitals and medical facilities as their resources are stretched.Projections from Harvard found that even if 50% of all currently occupied hospital beds were emptied the country would need at least three times more beds to care for everyone.Of course as we discussed earlier projections are tough to make since we don’t know how many Americans have already been infected.FacebookTwitter16h ago18:53Fact check:The Guardian’s Nina Lakhani reports.Dr. Birx also implied that contrary to reports there are enough ventilators to go around. “We don’t have evidence” that Americans who need a hospital bed or ventilator won’t have access to one Birx said.However an article in the New England Journal of Medicine published on Wednesday 25 March categorically concluded that the US does not have enough ventilators to treat patients with Covid-19 in the coming months.The authors American public health experts wrote: ‘There is a broad range of estimates of the number of ventilators we will need to care for U.S. patients with Covid-19 from several hundred thousand to as many as a million. The estimates vary depending on the number speed and severity of infections of course but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60000 to 160000 depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included. The national strategic reserve of ventilators is small and far from sufficient for the projected gap. No matter which estimate we use there are not enough ventilators for patients with Covid-19 in the upcoming months.”FacebookTwitter16h ago18:48How many Americans are and will get infected?Fact check:Dr. Birx said that predictions that huge swaths of the population will inevitably contract Covid-19 are misleading.Marc Lipsitch the head of the Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics predicted that between 20% and 60% of adults worldwide will ultimately get infected before a vaccine becomes widely available.But it’s difficult to predict how many people will get the infection because it’s nearly impossible to ascertain the actual number of cases. Many Americans with mild or no symptoms have not been tested for the coronavirus. A shortage of tests and the logistical difficulty of testing millions of people make that sort of widespread testing right now untenable.Amping up testing even more will be key to not only understanding the conditions “on the ground” as Birx said but also to developing more accurate predictions.As World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this week “You cannot fight a fire blindfolded and we cannot stop this pandemic if we don’t know who is infected. We have a simple message for all countries: Test test test.”Updated at 7.24pm EDTFacebookTwitter16h ago18:35Now that Donald Trump has exited the briefing room health officials Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx along with vice-president Mike Pence are addressing reporters.Dr. Birx said that the current predictions of the models do not match the conditions on the ground. Predictions that 60% or 70% will get infected in the next 8-12 weeks or even that 20% of a population will get infected are “very scary” she said. “But we don’t have data to match that.” The only countries with especially high rates of infection are very small she said.Reports today that hospitals were considering issuing “do not resuscitate” orders for Covid-19 patients were irresponsible Birx said.“There is no situation in the US right now that warrants that kind of discussion” she said “To say that to the American people - to make the implication that when they need a hospital bed it may not be there when they need a ventilator it may not be there.”Birx said that she believes there are enough ventilators — though they not be at the hospitals that need them most. “We can get creative” she said to ensure all hospitals have access.Updated at 7.05pm EDTFacebookTwitter16h ago18:18Fact check:The Guardian’s Nina Lakhani reports.Trump said that “the mortality rate in my opinion is way down”.But globally there are 521086 confirmed cases worldwide with 23567 deaths which is a mortality rate of 4.5% And while currently in the US the mortality rate currently stands at 1.4% (79708 confirmed cases and 1123 deaths) but the country is several weeks behind Asia and Europe regarding infection rates and there is widespread agreement among medical and public health experts that things (cases and deaths) are going to get much much worse in coming weeks.FacebookTwitter16h ago18:15Donald Trump said that the things there are likely hundreds of thousands of more cases because many people have few or minor symptoms even as he fixated on the idea of having Americans get back to work as soon as possible.“Many people have it. I just spoke to two people that had it” he said. “They never went to a doctor they didn’t report it” he added but likely were infected. He used the idea that many cases are mild and therefore undetected to justify his wish to scale back distancing measures and reopen closed businesses.“The people that actually die that percentage is much lower than I actually thought” he said.So far more than 1000 Americans have died from Covid-19.FacebookTwitter16h ago18:07Fact check:The Guardian’s Nina Lakhani reports“Nobody would have ever thought a thing like this could have happened” Trump said.In fact the US intelligence community public health experts and officials in Trump’s own administration had warned for years that the country was at risk from a pandemic including specific warnings about a coronavirus outbreak.When this strain of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was identified in Wuhan China in early January health experts immediately cautioned that it could turn into a global health crisis.“This was foreseeable and foreseen weeks and months ago and only now is the White House coming out of denial and heading straight into saying it could not have been foreseen” Marc Lipsitch director of Harvard’s Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics told CNN on Sunday.FacebookTwitter16h ago18:04Asked about the number of shuttered restaurants the president responded: “It may not be the same restaurant. It may not be the same ownership. But they’ll all be back.”He also addressed why he’s backed off using the term “Chinese virus” to refer to the coronavirus.“I think it was time” he said. He said that the president of China didn’t ask him to stop but said that Chinese official may have reached out to American officials. “I don’t have to say it if they feel so strongly about it” Trump said even as he doubled down on his right to use the term.
137,Why do rightwing populist leaders oppose experts?,Jan-Werner Müller,The Guardian,-1,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/rightwing-populist-leaders-oppose-experts-not-elites,It is conventional wisdom that populists are against “elites” – and experts in particular. But rightwing populists aren’t opposed to all elites – they only denounce professionals who claim authority on the basis of special knowledge. Their perverse version of rightwing anti-authoritarianism implies that there is nothing wrong with the wealthy; in fact the latter can be superior sources of wisdom. Trump putting the advice of “business leaders” above that of infectious disease experts is likely to yield deadly results. But it’s important to understand that the systematic denigration of professionalism started not with the populists – Reagan Thatcher and other cheerleaders for neoliberalism led the way. Under coronavirus pro-market ideologies are overturned around the world. But it's too little too lateJeff SparrowJeff Sparrow Read morePopulists are often criticized for being great simplifiers when the world is in fact highly complex. For those who take Trump to be the paradigmatic populist of our day it’s easy to conclude that populists are constantly lying and ushering in a “post-truth” era in which falsehoods exclusively produced by the daily White House reality TV show are literally turning out to be deadly.But this picture is itself simplistic. Populists are not by definition liars. They are only committed to one particular empirical falsehood: the notion that they and only they represent what populists often call “the real people” – with the implication that other politicians are not only corrupt and “crooked” but traitors to the people or as Trump has often put it “Un-American”.More important it’s not true that today’s rightwing populists are indiscriminately against all elites. They only denounce professionals. Trump supporters did not find it scandalous that his cabinet was full of Wall Street figures. The base does not resent the rich – rather it aspires to be rich. In their eyes the wealthy have earned their money an objective indicator of their “hard work” or the fact that they really produced something (never mind that the likes of Ross and Mnuchin have never created anything and only shifted money around).These supposed movers and shakers contrast starkly with professionals who claim authority on the basis of education and special licensing – think lawyers doctors and professors. Such figures can automatically be maligned by rightwing culture warriors as “condescending” – after all they tell other people what to do because they claim to know better. According to Nigel Farage for instance the World Health Organization is just another club of “clever people” who want to “bully us”.Is the success of the Trumps Bolsonaros and Johnsons of this world proof that the people can always be seduced by demagogues – and simply don’t know what’s good for them? Distrust of professionalism does not come out of nowhere. Neoliberalism paved the way for these attitudes. Margaret Thatcher memorably held that academics didn’t really do any work; in fact they all – with the possible exception of scientists – seemed to be lefties wasting taxpayers’ money. Tories introduced the imperative constantly to audit and assess (and discipline and punish those not measuring up); only what could be counted counted. Governments that praised “free markets” – the spontaneous emergence of economic order – actually ended up constructing entirely artificial “markets” in academia and healthcare. These pseudo-markets had to provide the right “incentives” – because so the assumption went professionals could not possibly be motivated by intrinsic goals of helping patients or pursuing research or educating young people. This concerted attack on professionalism made it easier for Trump and Boris Johnson to claim that they might just know better than leading scientistsThe result was not a genuine market but a vast bureaucracy reminiscent of the late Soviet Union. What one historian has called “the tyranny of metrics” meant that the measure became the target; the relentless quantification of performance distorted what and how professionals performed. Enormous resources and a fair bit of cunning went into gaming a system which was based on the suspicion that professional self-regulation and internal accountability are sham ideals that just justify professionals erecting monopolies and closed shops.This concerted attack on professionalism made it easier for Trump and Boris Johnson to claim that they might just know better than leading scientists. Business leaders are praised as more capable decision-makers when it comes to the length of a lockdown than epidemiologists. Trump – who apparently listens to theories cooked up by his uniquely unqualified son-in-law and fears being upstaged by Anthony Fauci – has still not understood that the longer amateur hour at the very top lasts the more lives will be lost.The Covid-19 crisis might lead us to a clear-eyed view of the value of professionalism (including professionals in politics like say Hillary Clinton). But it’s also important to keep professionalism in its place. Professional advice should constrain political choices not determine them. Proper professionals unlike technocrats do not promise that they know the uniquely correct solution to all policy problems.The assumption that there is only one right way is perversely shared by populists and technocrats: populists claim that there is only one authentic popular will (to build a Wall get Brexit done or what have you) and that they are the only ones who know it – and the only ones who can implement it. The technocratic stance – widely on display on the continent during the European debt crisis – holds that there is only one rational answer to policy challenges and that only technocrats can identify it. If you disagree with a populist you are declared a traitor to the people; if you disagree with a technocrat you’ll be told politely that you’re not smart enough.The lesson is not that professionalism should replace democratic politics or for that matter widespread participation by citizens – a conclusion drawn by unashamedly elitist liberals who have sought to reinstate professional gatekeepers everywhere but especially in primaries. Citizens still know best what their problems are; professionals – in perfectly non-condescending ways – play a crucial role in addressing them. Or as John Dewey the greatest American philosopher of democracy in the 20th century put it “no government by experts in which the masses do not have the chance to inform the experts as to their needs can be anything but an oligarchy managed in the interests of the few.”
138,To beat the coronavirus slump shut us down now Mr President,Gene Marks,The Guardian,-1,https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/25/coronavirus-slump-shut-us-down-now-mr-president,More than half of US small businesses don’t have the wherewithal to survive and could be out of business in under 90 days if things stay as they are.That’s one of the more startling numbers from a survey of more than 1500 small business conducted by Goldman Sachs. As of now according to the study almost all small businesses have been affected in some way by the pandemic mostly slower sales. More than half of the small businesses surveyed don’t have the ability for their employees to work from home – not a big surprise considering that so many of them are in the retail and restaurant industries.The economic situation in my opinion will only get worse the longer the pandemic is allowed to progress. Most small businesses will not be able to make it to the summer. Even if they’re allowed to reopen without the public being confident that the virus has been fully contained and that a treatment is either available or on the way consumers and diners will stay away. “Self-quarantines” and localized shutdowns aren’t going to work fast enough.So what’s the answer? A full shutdown in the US. For three full weeks.Why three weeks? Because the virus has been known to run its course in about 14 days – at least that’s the amount of time our doctors are telling us to isolate. So I say give it another week just to make sure. Our grandparents were asked to fight world wars. We can handle 21 days of watching Netflix.What do I mean by a full shutdown? I mean everything – other than a carefully selected list of essential businesses – gets shut. No planes trains or automobiles. No stock market. No services other than the most critical. No one’s allowed out of their homes except for food medical and maybe a little fresh air once in a while or to walk their dogs. The president can do this. He’s a “war president”. He’s got the military and federal tools at his disposal. Yes it’s draconian. Yes it’s martial law. But no there won’t be an uprising or a civil war.People will comply. Why?Because everyone – particularly small business owners – just wants this to be over and done with as soon as possible. We don’t have until August as Trump recently predicted. We need to get back up and running much sooner than that. The good news is that the federal government already passed a relief bill that makes capital accessible to small businesses through the Small Business Administration. States have also set up relief funds. Many larger businesses are offering grants and deferrals to their smaller customers. There is short-term cash available for a business to tread water over three weeks.Most importantly we need certainty. We need a plan. With a specific date of reopening on the horizon we’ll have that plan. We’ll know that the all clear is 19 days 12 days five days away. While at home those of us that can will be able to still speak with our employees clean up our databases reaffirm with customers and vendors and make a strategy for a return to normalcy. Yes small businesses are suffering – but some are helping to fight coronavirusGene Marks Read moreAnd what a return it will be. Imagine everyone getting the all clear and emerging from their homes into the April sunshine. Imagine the restaurants the shops the events and the co-workers who are joyfully – yes joyfully – happy to go back to work. Think of the orders the shipments the transactions … the future. Of course things won’t be 100% cleared up. The virus will still be out there (although I hope there will be further announcements of potential treatments). Other countries will still be grappling with the problem and travel – particularly overseas – will take longer to recover.But being shut for three weeks will have a dramatic impact on the number of cases and deaths. So go ahead Mr President #shutusdown. We can take it. Our businesses depend on it.
139,The Guardian view on China and the US: a stricken world without leaders,,The Guardian,-1,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/the-guardian-view-on-china-and-the-us-a-stricken-world-without-leaders,Once upon a time wise elders foretold that east and west would meet a reviving and ruling power coming together in new leadership. The idea of a Sino-American G2 reaching bilateral consensus on key issues to prudently steer the international community always sounded like a fairytale. But from this moment in time it seems more like a bad joke. As a pandemic threatens millions of lives and further suffering through a global recession the shortcomings of China and the US are increasingly glaring.Chinese authorities covered up the Wuhan outbreak and harassed those who tried to blow the whistle allowing the coronavirus to spread within and then beyond its borders – though subsequent draconian measures appear to have contained the internal spread for now at least and should have bought time for other countries to prepare. Chinese diplomats and state media promoted wild conspiracy theories suggesting the virus originated or was even created in the US even if officials may now be drawing back. Last week with everyone’s attention on the pandemic Beijing threw out US journalists from major news organisations in belated retaliation for tightened controls on Chinese state media companies in the US.Meanwhile Donald Trump spent weeks dismissing concerns and suggested the virus would “disappear” and was “very well under control”. He ceded responsibility to states and now wants to return to business as usual as if that were possible – even as the World Health Organization warns that America could become the new centre of the pandemic. Medical experts and governors are in despair. He tried to lure a German firm developing a possible vaccine to the US. He promoted an unproven treatment. With gratuitous cruelty his administration has tightened sanctions on Iran one of the worst-hit countries. He has until this week insisted on referring to “the Chinese virus” despite the resulting stigma and hate crime.Mr Trump may yet regret his finger-pointing; many materials needed for equipment such as masks are mainly produced in China. Pundits have blamed predatory pricing by Chinese firms for ending penicillin and aspirin production in the US but the US has also showed complacency in failing to protect key national resources and relying on foreign production.Washington’s failures are allowing Beijing despite its own culpability to restore its image and build foreign influence. “The only country that can help us is China … European solidarity does not exist” declared the Serbian president Aleksandar Vučić last week; masks and health experts arrived days later. China’s dispatches of medical supplies to other countries are welcome; so presumably were the shipments it received from the EU when the outbreak emerged and the equipment that European neighbours have shared with each other. The EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned on Tuesday of a “struggle for influence” including through the “politics of generosity”. The bloc must show that solidarity is not an empty phrase he wrote.The pandemic has underscored the need for international cooperation. When problems are global solutions must be too. But it has also shown once more that China and the US are neither fit to lead nor interested in cooperation and that the rest of the world will need to find its own ways of working together.
140,Will the coronavirus 'kill populism'? Don't count on it,Cas Mudde,The Guardian,-1,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-populism-trump-politics-response,While epidemiologists are still trying to come to grips with the severity of the coronavirus pandemic with different models predicting different outcomes the pundits are already certain “coronavirus will change the world permanently”. Social and traditional media are also full of hot takes mostly that coronavirus will change globalization “hugely for the better” and that it could “kill populism”.Unlike these pundits I don’t have a crystal ball but comparative analysis and historical experience warn against such big expectations. On the former let’s just look back a mere 10 years and see how much “globalization” has changed since the Great Recession. The answer is: not much. In the US banks are bigger than ever Wall Street is handing out near-record bonuses again and almost no one of significance went to jail.But if the structures remain unaffected will the players be changed? Will “populism” be the “next victim” of coronavirus? Many hundreds of columns have been written about the “incompetent” and “dangerous” responses by Boris Johnson and Donald Trump who we are told have shown us the “limits of populism”. But despite the obsessive coverage of these two leaders they are not the only populist leaders – they are and not even the best examples of populists.If we look a little bit further we see very different responses by populists around the world. There are some highly prominent examples of the stereotypical approach ie populists denying reality distracting the public with conspiracy theories and offering slow and halfhearted policies. Far-right presidents like Trump and his Brazilian wannabe Jair Bolsonaro are much-cited examples though the Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador a nominal leftwing populist is hardly better.But other populists have taken the threat much more seriously. In fact in the Netherlands the populist radical right Forum for Democracy (FvD) and Party for Freedom (PVV) have criticized the mainstream coalition government of conservative Mark Rutte for being too lax and have been urging him for weeks to not just close the borders but adopt similar “lockdown” policies to those most other EU countries have enforced. And let us not forget that the hardest-hit country in Europe Italy which has in many ways set the tone for responses elsewhere on the continent is governed by a coalition of the center-left Democratic party and the populist Five Star Movement.Similarly in India Narendra Modi one of Trump’s biggest allies and the leader of the largest populist radical right party in the world has locked down his country of 1.3 billion people for 21 days. “Every state every district every lane every village will be under lockdown” Modi stated. To be fair this kills two birds with one stone as his government has faced mass street protests over a host of issues in recent months which will now become impossible.Other populist leaders have used the coronavirus to push through authoritarian “emergency measures” too. Viktor Orbán is continuing his transformation of Hungary into an authoritarian regime with draconic new measures while Benjamin Netanyahu has used the coronavirus to execute an autogolpe (self-coup) in Israel suspending the courts and parliament. But many non-populist leaders have declared states of emergency too whereas some populists including surprisingly Trump have (so far) done little.In short there is not one single “populist response” to the coronavirus pandemic. There is not even a single “rightwing populist response”. Populist parties and politicians have responded very differently in part depending upon whether they are in government or opposition. They are also faced with very different contexts both in terms of number of infections and control of the media.For example while Johnson and Trump are criticized daily by the majority of their respective national media and have to rely on the uncritical loyalty of their supportive conservative media complex populist radical right leaders in Hungary and Poland have full control of the state media which boast about the low level of infections without telling their audience about the low level of tests in the country.It is far too early to make grand predictions on how the coronavirus will change the world. But we can already say that it will almost certainly not “kill populism” for the simple reason that “populism” does not have one unitary response to the pandemic. Based on recent historical experience I would put my money on the coronavirus crisis having at best a moderate overall effect on populists: some will win some will lose and some will stay the same.

Earlier Thursday Massie tweeted the section of the Constitution that defines a quorum — a rule he could use to derail the bill if enough of his colleagues aren't present and voting.The House needs a quorum — half its membership — present to pass a bill if any single member demands one. If no one asks for a quorum it is assumed a quorum exists. That is what would allow the House to act without a recorded vote by voice or by unanimous consent. There are five vacancies in the 435-member House so 216 votes constitutes a majority."

And those new guidelines will assist governors and other officials in deciding on ""maintaining increasing or relaxing social distancing and other mitigation measures they have put in place.""The president said that by doing ""robust surveillance testing"" officials will be able to ""monitor the spread of the virus throughout the country.""Public health experts have said easing restrictions too soon could overburden hospitals and lead to more deaths and economic damage related to the virus.Although the president said in the letter that ""there is still a long battle ahead"" Trump said Tuesday he wants the country back to business by April 12 Easter Sunday even though his own public health officials have warned that the outbreak will get worse.""You'll have packed churches all over our country"" he said in an interview on Fox News.

Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker announced a stay-at-home ""advisory"" Monday. California Illinois New Jersey New York and Pennsylvania are among the other states implementing sweeping mandates.States are also looking to the federal government for critical help.Trump has declared disasters in New York California Washington Louisiana Iowa Florida Texas and Illinois due to the coronavirus outbreak. Connecticut on Thursday joined the growing list of states that have asked the Federal Emergency Management Agency for a disaster declaration to cope with the ""severity and magnitude"" of the coronavirus outbreak.Although governors and local officials have the authority to lift their mandates Trump has been eager for American life to get back to normal and regain the strong economy his administration boasted before the outbreak. However some state lawmakers have resisted the calls.New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo strongly criticized Trump's effort saying Tuesday that ""we will not put a dollar figure on human life.""""We can have a public health strategy that is consistent with an economic one"" he said in a tweet. ""No one should be talking about social Darwinism for the sake of the stock market.""Cuomo a Democrat has also been critical of the massive $2 trillion relief package which Trump praised and which passed the Senate late Wednesday. The governor called it a ""shortfall"" compared to the funding relief the state needs."
143,Still buffering? Biden works to boost visibility as nation confronts coronavirus pandemic,Adam Edelman,NBC,-1,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/still-buffering-biden-works-boost-visibility-nation-confronts-coronavirus-pandemic-n1169361,"Malcolm Kenyatta a member of the Pennsylvania state House and a supporter of Joe Biden held up his beverage and smiled. Biden the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination grinned back and held up a paper cup telling his audience that it was filled with Gatorade.“I’m probably the only Irishman you know who’s never had a drink” Biden who abstains from alcohol said.It sounds like a classic scene from a campaign meet-and-greet over drinks at a local bar in a battleground state. But this amicable exchange actually happened online during a virtual happy hour hosted by Biden's campaign in this new technology-fueled age of socializing — and running for president — in the time of the coronavirus.The gathering which saw more than 310000 people tune in to the former vice president's website Wednesday evening according to the campaign was mostly glitch-free — and just one of a slew of digital events and TV appearances Biden has added to his schedule in recent days.But being forced to take his message entirely online has been anything but easy for the likely Democratic nominee who racked up big primary election wins in early March but largely stayed out of public view as the country confronted a worsening pandemic and his campaign attempted in fits and starts to pivot fully to digital. He faced criticism from both the left and the right over seeming to recede into the background at a critical juncture while renewed efforts to boost his visibility and an improved virtual campaign operation have come as the coronavirus response from President Donald Trump as well as Democrats like New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo dominates the headlines.Biden’s campaign acknowledged the steep learning curve it encountered in making the transition — and said it has already seen success with efforts like a digital video explainer on COVID-19 the disease caused by the virus that it put out to counter Trump's daily briefings on the topic.""In the past few days alone the Vice President has been connecting with millions of people where they are"" campaign spokesperson Remi Yamamoto said in a statement.Biden along with Democratic rival Bernie Sanders and Trump announced earlier this month that because of the spread of the coronavirus all of his campaign events will be “virtual” meaning supporters and members of the media could participate or watch online.But after two successful events — remarks to supporters broadcast from Philadelphia after his primary night wins March 10 and a speech on the coronavirus delivered two days later from Wilmington Delaware and streamed online — issues were apparent. A “virtual town hall” held via Facebook Live on March 13 was marred by an hourslong delay and significant technical difficulties. (The campaign later emailed reporters vowing to improve the quality of the virtual events.)Joe Biden✔@JoeBidenAlright folks. We're doing a happy hour tonight and you're invited.

It marked his debut from a freshly-built studio in the basement of his Wilmington home which he used in the following days to appear on ABC’s “The View” and on CNN and MSNBC.Though Biden’s return to the public eye was a successful one — Monday's livestream attracted more than 3.5 million views across all platforms his campaign said — the uptick in appearances revealed new challenges. His Tuesday time on ""The View"" was interrupted in the New York media market by the daily coronavirus press conference held by Cuomo whose leadership as the governor of a state hardest-hit by the pandemic so far has attracted national attention and drawn praise from allies and past critics alike.Hours later Biden's interview with MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace was marred by awkward pauses due to the time it took for each person to hear the other one before being able to respond.That nearly weeklong stretch of no visual events meanwhile prompted criticism from both sides of the political spectrum. The Trump campaign circulated a “#WhereisJoe” hashtag on Twitter and on the left left-learning publications and supporters of Sanders seized on Biden's absence too.“Serious question: Where is Joe Biden?"" Carmen Yulín Cruz a national Sanders campaign co-chair and the mayor of San Juan Puerto Rico tweeted March 21. Current Affairs a progressive magazine published a searing article titled ""Where is Joe?"" the next day.David Plouffe a Democratic political strategist who managed Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign said on Yahoo News' ""Skullduggery"" podcast that the challenges Biden faces are in part ""just the reality.""""He’s going to be eclipsed because obviously for good or for bad and usually bad we’re in the middle of a crisis and the president is going to take center stage"" Plouffe said on the episode released Wednesday. ""You’ve got governors and mayors who are leading crisis response locally. Biden is not in office now so that’s just the reality.""But Biden can still break through Plouffe told the podcast if he continues to adapt to the digital environment.“The Biden campaign has an acute need to really up their game and understand how people receive information in this day” Plouffe said.Biden himself admitted that there was a learning curve when it came to connecting with his supporters and to the world in a virtual campaign.“What I'm trying to do is become much more facile in being able to use social networking here” he told Wallace on Tuesday. “The fact is that I'm in the basement of my home.”“I’m learning how to deal with the vehicles that are available to get news out and get to communicate with people” he added.His campaign promised that it would continue to use new tools to meet the moment.“As we continue in this new campaign environment we will continue to explore and innovate with new digital tools and formats connecting voters with the vice president and further disseminating his message"" Yamamoto the campaign spokesperson said.Those methods were on full display Wednesday with Biden holding his first virtual press briefing. Using Zoom a remote videoconferencing app Biden spoke for a few moments before his staff called on various reporters to ask questions.Alex Seitz-Wald✔@aseitzwaldThis is how a virtual press conference works: You click the ""raise hand"" button to get in the queue to ask a Q then get unmuted and put on screen (!) to ask it.Big downside is campaign has complete control over which Qs get through instead of free-for-all of a live presser.View image on Twitter571:40 PM - Mar 25 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy35 people are talking about thisLater his campaign debuted a new newsletter that included a “What I’m Reading” section movie recommendations answers to emails from supporters and a request to donate to the campaign.

This time there's little opposition.In part that's because lawmakers and President Donald Trump are also set to approve unprecedented support for ordinary Americans in the form of direct payments the extension and expansion of benefits for the unemployed and a provision forcing companies to keep 90 percent of their workforce on payroll if they accept government assistance.The cash infusion will bring badly needed relief to millions of Americans across the country.But faced with difficult choices about who to help and who to help the most Congress opted for all of the above on the first question and major corporations on the latter. The result is an emergency coronavirus bill that lawmakers say contains $2.2 trillion in relief 880 times the size of what Trump said was needed a month ago as he needled Democrats who sought $8 billion.Donald J. Trump✔@realDonaldTrumpCryin’ Chuck Schumer is complaining for publicity purposes only that I should be asking for more money than $2.5 Billion to prepare for Coronavirus.

""Obviously gotta do both.""The devil is in the details which members of Congress are still learning even after the Senate passed the bill 96-0 on Wednesday night.The House plans to send it to the president Friday by voice vote — which would avoid most members having to come back to Washington — but there could be a complication after Democratic and Republican leaders Thursday believed at least one member could demand a recorded vote.Ultimately passage isn't in jeopardy. A handful of the most liberal and conservative lawmakers have raised objections to parts of the bill.But the overall decision to bolster the private sector with hundreds of billions of tax dollars — and to have taxpayers assume even more risk than that — has been far less controversial than the fight over the 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program.The political class is making a bipartisan bet: First that voters will believe it's the right thing to do to help companies devastated by the economic impact of the coronavirus; and second that TARP actually worked to stabilize the economy and reignite growth.Gary Gensler who served as chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission under President Barack Obama said there are important similarities and differences between the coronavirus bill and the 2008 bailout.""It's a far different crisis and this time it's a different Treasury secretary chairman of the Fed and president but they basically went to Congress and asked for $500 billion to buy corporate debt"" said Gensler referring to the current administration. ""They’re using similar tools to what they were using back then whether you like them or you don’t like them.""The $700 billion rescue measure in 2008 considered a behemoth in its day failed the first time it was brought to the House floor. Vice President Mike Pence then a member of the House voted against it explaining that ""there are alternatives to massive federal spending"" and judging that the measure was ""the largest corporate bailout in American history forever changes the relationship between government and the financial sector and passes the cost along to the American taxpayer.""On Thursday Wall Street demonstrated its love for the new bill as the Dow Jones Industrial Average the NASDAQ composite and Standard & Poor's 500 indices shot skyward largely ignoring the record 3.3 million new unemployment claims reported an hour before the New York Stock Exchange's opening bell.It was a must-do according to Tony Fratto a former Treasury and White House official in President George W. Bush's administration.""We don't know whether this bill will be enough spending to get us through to the other end of the tunnel but it has all the right parts — it helps people and businesses and health care providers and it tries to do it very quickly and with very few strings attached"" said Fratto who is now managing partner at the Washington communications and crisis-management consulting firm Hamilton Place Strategies. ""That's the best way to solve the problem.""Still liberals worry that the gulf between the rich and the poor will widen and deepen. Conservatives say the unemployment benefits are too generous and that the measure includes items that are superfluous to the crisis at hand. And special interests of all varieties are scouring the final text to see if they got what they wanted or were left in the lurch.Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif. a former leader of her chamber's Progressive Caucus said Thursday that the U.S. hasn't ""seen the end"" of direct payments to Americans as she called for a fourth coronavirus bill to get moving soon.On the other side of the Capitol some Republicans suggested they were holding their noses as they voted.""I have significant reservations about many provisions in this bill that are antithetical to everything I believe in but we're facing a crisis and this is the only option to get immediate help to small businesses and unemployed workers"" Sen. Rick Scott R-Fla. said in a statement after he and several colleagues failed to convince the Senate that the unemployment insurance provisions would create a disincentive to work.While top congressional leaders have said they expect this won't be the last relief bill it won't be clear for some time whether the money and new authorities granted to the administration will be the right salve or if they will be viewed as a prudent expenditure of taxpayer dollars.The real cost of the legislation will take years to be determined. The unemployment benefits will be paid out to an unknown number of people. Treasury now has the authority to underwrite half a trillion dollars in assistance to companies. And the department has the flexibility to take advantage of a corporate resurgence by taking stock in participating companies.One new feature of the coronavirus bill is authority for the Treasury secretary to accept warrants from companies seeking loans which effectively give the government the potential to reap bigger benefits from companies that do well.Much of the outgoing flow of money is expected to come in the form of guarantees that will secure loans from the Federal Reserve to major corporations with a fraction of the value of the loan provided by Treasury.""It's not a blank check in the sense that we are limited by the ability to take losses"" Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell told NBC's Savannah Guthrie on NBC's ""TODAY"" show. The loans require ""full security so we don't lose money"" and ""one-dollar of loss absorption is worth 10 dollars worth of loans.""In plain English that means the Federal Reserve won't take the hit if companies borrow money and fail to repay it. Instead Treasury — really the American taxpayer — is on the hook for loans valued at 10 times the amount it costs to obtain them. The upside is an injection of as much as $5 trillion into the bloodstream of the private sector with the chance that the government will end up making money.The risk is that collapsing companies put the government deeper into debt.""We are trying to create a bridge from our very strong economy to another place of economic strength and that's what our lending really does"" Powell said adding that there is ""essentially"" no limit to the amount of money the Fed is willing to pump out.That should make CEOs and investors very happy — at least for the moment."
145,Coronavirus checks direct deposits are coming. Here's everything you need to know.,Josh Lederman and Sahil Kapur,NBC,-1,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/coronavirus-checks-direct-deposits-are-coming-here-s-everything-you-n1168936,"As the coronavirus crisis ravages the U.S. economy millions of Americans are urgently awaiting financial help from Congress in the form of direct cash payments.Congressional leaders and President Donald Trump announced a bipartisan deal Wednesday on a massive $2 trillion emergency economic package that includes direct cash payments to people across the country to help them through the crisis. The Senate passed the bill 96 to 0 and the House is expected to follow suit on Friday.But who’s eligible to get a check and for how much? Here are some questions and answers about who qualifies for cash from the federal government:Q: How much will I get?Depends on how much you make.If you made less than $75000 in 2019 you will be eligible for the full payment of $1200. Couples who filed jointly and made less than $150000 will get $2400. An individual who filed as ""head of household"" and earned $112500 or less gets $1200.For every child in the household you will receive an additional $500.If you made more than $75000 your payment will be reduced by $5 for every $100 of income that exceeds the limits. So if you made $80000 in 2019 you will receive $950. The payment decreases to zero for an individual making $99000 or more or a couple making $198000 or more.If you're a family of four you’ll be eligible for a maximum of $3400.Q: When is the money coming?Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday the checks will be sent out ""within three weeks"" to people for whom the IRS has information. You don't need to sign up or fill out a form to receive a payment if you've been working and paying taxes since 2018.The Treasury Department will also run a ""public awareness campaign"" with information about the program including for people who didn’t file a tax return for 2018 or 2019.Q: Will there be multiple payments?No this legislation only authorizes one-time payments. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested on CNN that Congress could revisit the issue: ""We think we'll get more direct payments in another bill.""Q: Where do I sign up?You don't. There's no sign up. The payments will be automatic for people who have filed a tax return or gotten Social Security benefits recently. The IRS asks people not to call with questions but to keep checking this website where they will post updates about the program once they are available.Q: How will the money be sent?If you've gotten a tax refund in the last two years by direct deposit that's where the money will be sent. If not the IRS can mail a check to your ""last known address"" and it has 15 days to notify you of the method and amount of the payment. They'll send a phone number and appropriate point of contact so you can tell them if you didn't receive it.If you’ve moved recently it may be a good idea to notify the IRS as soon as possible. The IRS also suggests that if you haven't yet filed a tax return for 2018 or 2019 do it as soon as you can so that the government has your up-to-date information on file.Q: How does the gov't calculate how much I earned?Have you filed your taxes for 2019 already? If so the checks will automatically be based on your 2019 return. Look for your ""adjusted gross income"" (Line 7 on your Form 1040 tax return in 2018 or line 8B on a 2019 return.) If you haven't filed your 2019 taxes yet it'll be based on your 2018 return.Q: I'm on Social Security or don’t make enough to file a tax return. Will I get a check?Yes. Even if you didn't file a tax return for 2018 or 2019 or pay taxes in those years you will be eligible if you received a Form SSA-1099 for the year 2019. That's a form that the Social Security Administration sends each year to people who receive Social Security benefits including retirement and disability.Q: I’m a disabled vet but don't pay taxes. Do I qualify?Yes although some of the details still need to be worked out. The IRS is expected to set up a system so that disabled veterans don't fall through the cracks.Q: I'm a college student. Do I get a check?If your parents claim you as a dependent on their taxes you're ineligible. But if you've been working and filing taxes independently in recent years you may qualify.Q: I made too much money in 2019 to qualify. But now I've been laid off. Am I out of luck?Not necessarily but you'll have to wait.If you made too much to qualify in your last tax filing you probably won't be eligible for the cash benefit immediately. But you can apply for it when you file your 2020 tax return if your income drops below below $99000 threshold for individuals (which doubles for couples) this year.The IRS is expected to create a system to ensure help for people who fall into this category.Q: I'm not an American citizen. Do I qualify?Yes — as long as you're living and working in the U.S. with a valid Social Security number. That includes green card holders and it generally includes those on work visas such as an H-1B and H-2A. But it generally excludes visitors and people who are in the U.S. illegally.Q: Are the cash payments taxable?Nope.Q: I live in Puerto Rico or another U.S. territory. Is that a problem?Not at all. There’s a special provision ensuring that people living in U.S. territories even ones that have a different tax system are still eligible.Q: What if I'm homeless or recently got out of prison? Will I get help?As long as you have a Social Security number you should be eligible to apply for the relief payments under the new system created by the IRS.Q: I owe back taxes. Will the IRS snatch my check?The bill doesn't exclude you from getting a payment if you owe past due taxes. That said the IRS has yet to set up the new system."
146,Americans don't know what to do about coronavirus. Neither does the president.,Jonathan Allen,NBC,-1,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/americans-don-t-know-what-do-about-coronavirus-neither-does-n1168696,"President Donald Trump has told Americans that he's taking bold moves to fight the coronavirus crisis but his actions and messages have been muddled by uncertainty about public health the economy and politics.All across the globe regardless of the form of government or political ideology foreign leaders are issuing edicts to shut down society to slow the spread of the deadly disease. Governors and mayors are doing the same heeding the warnings of epidemiologists who say there's no way of telling when it will be safe for people to congregate. And most of Congress is expected to flee Washington for weeks — available to return when needed — if an emergency $2 trillion rescue bill is sent to Trump in the next few days.But the president the leader of the free world is acting as if he's smarter than the rest of them — suggesting that he can save lives and salvage fortunes by encouraging America to get back to work sooner rather than later. He's even chosen a day with great symbolic but little scientific value as his target for people to congregate again: Easter Sunday April 12.""President Trump is balancing two huge responsibilities — to safeguard the physical and the economic health of the country"" said Boris Epshteyn a member of the Trump 2020 advisory board and former special assistant to the president. ""It is vital for Americans to remain healthy and safe while it is also critical for the American economy to not be crippled by the fight against the coronavirus which we will win.""Many of Trump's allies and critics see a commander-in-chief who is actually torn by competing instincts advice and political pressures which helps explain why he is delivering confusing messages to the American public while using only some of the powers available to him to fight the spread of the disease. Trump who has seen his approval numbers rise during the crisis will ultimately be judged by the outcomes for public health and the economy come November's election.The Gallup polling organization concluded the boost in Trump's favorability among independents and Democrats suggests a ""rally effect"" in recent weeks.""Historically presidential job approval has increased when the nation is under threat"" Jeffrey M. Jones wrote on Gallup's website. Those gains do not always last long — George H.W. Bush saw approval around the 90 percent mark during the first Iraq War before he lost re-election — and they have tended to show much smaller swings in the recent era of partisan polarization.Health experts in the Trump administration have said that failing to slow the virus would have catastrophic consequences both in terms of deaths and in the resulting economic calamity. Until recently Trump was listening to them enough that he said on March 16 that his focus was on ""this virus problem"" because ""everything else is going to fall into place"" once the public health crisis is dealt with.Since Trump hasn't actually ordered anyone to stay at home or frozen economic activity it's not clear that word from him would encourage Americans to leave their houses or force state local and business officials to lift bans on gatherings. Moreover some warn that the economy could be harmed even more if the president calls for the resumption of normal activities and the health crisis gets worse as a result.On Tuesday Dr. Anthony Fauci the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases followed up Trump's talk about an Easter timeline by noting that ""no one is going to want to tone down things"" when they see how badly New York and other cities are being overwhelmed by the disease.""Trump needs to resist the urge to listen to economists until we have defeated the virus"" said Dan Eberhart a major Republican donor and CEO of Canary an oilfield services company. ""If Trump tries to restart the economy too soon and the pandemic continues to spread that will be his legacy and it will be a legacy of failure.""Eberhart supports Trump and believes the president should listen to medical professionals now and economists later.There will be plenty of time for political considerations said Chris Kofinis a Democratic strategist who warned that efforts by partisans to turn Trump's handling of the crisis to his benefit or detriment are risky.""The reality here is that voters are paralyzed by a crisis defined by two powerful fears: the fear of a worsening pandemic and fear of a coming depression"" Kofinis said. ""President Trump and Democrats should be extremely careful about trivializing either fear or trying to exploit either one for political gain."" He added that few Americans care about partisan politics at the moment.Former Vice President Joe Biden the front-runner for the Democratic nomination has been countering the president in interviews from the basement of his home while political action committees that support him are attacking Trump in ads.And Jim Messina who ran President Barack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign told MSNBC's ""Andrea Mitchell Reports"" on Wednesday that Trump's various remarks over the course of the crisis lend themselves to political ads that will be ""very difficult for him to rebut in the fall of this year.""No one is in a more precarious political position than the president who wavers between appealing to a Republican base that is increasingly pushing him to put economic considerations ahead of slowing the spread of the virus and bowing to the reality that the disease is a growing threat.When Trump is riffing in front of a microphone he is often pitting Americans against each other along political ideological and geographical grounds — picking winners and losers casting blame and patting himself on the back for winning a ""war"" against a virus that doesn't respond nearly as much to unpredictability in strategy and tactics as his language might imply.Behind the scenes members of his administration are working to deliver resources to states negotiating a rescue package with Democrats in Congress and listening closely to scientists on how to handle the public health part of the pandemic. At the same time those efforts have been constrained by Trump's reluctance to deploy the full power of the federal government to allocate medical supplies to states and to force private companies to replenish them.Vice President Mike Pence has hinted at the ideological underpinning of the administration's decision not to invoke the Defense Production Act to do more to manage the crisis leaving more responsibility and accountability at the state and local level.""It’s extremely important that the American people recognize that one of the things that makes America different is that we have a system of federalism"" Pence said Sunday.""We want states to be able to manage the unique circumstances in their states"" he said.Governors particularly Andrew Cuomo of New York have said that the help isn't coming fast enough from the federal government.What may be coming too fast are the twists turns and lurches in Trump's thinking."
147,My mother is not expendable': As Trump itches to get U.S. back to work experts warn of deaths economic calamity,Allan Smith and Shannon Pettypiece,NBC,-1,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-echoes-some-right-pushing-get-back-work-health-experts-n1167611,"The clamor for a swift return to normal has started to pick up in recent days — particularly in the right-wing media ecosystem.That's come as President Donald Trump has suggested that he could quickly move to change his administration's guidelines in dealing with the coronavirus outbreak in hope of returning some people to work in less than three weeks and ending the stock market slide.No example drew more attention than an interview that Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick a Republican gave Monday night on Fox News in which he suggested that some elderly Americans — the group most at risk of death from COVID-19 — should be willing to sacrifice their lives so the economy can gain steam.""No one reached out to me and said 'As a senior citizen are you willing to take a chance on your survival in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for its children and grandchildren?' And if that is the exchange I'm all in"" said Patrick 70.But Scott Gottlieb Trump's former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration tweeted that while there is ""a strong and understandable desire to return to better times and a functioning economy"" it ""should not be lost on anyone that there's no such thing as a functioning economy and society so long as COVID-19 continues to spread uncontrolled in our biggest cities.""Gottlieb and other experts have warned that too quick a return would cause much more economic distress than continuing course for a while longer.""So long as COVID-19 spreads uncontrolled older people will die in historic numbers middle aged folks doomed to prolonged ICU stays to fight for their lives hospitals will be overwhelmed and most Americans terrified to leave homes eat out take the subway or go to the park"" he said adding ""there's no easy return"" and ""we must accept a sober truth.""Speaking at a news conference Tuesday New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo pushed back against Patrick's sentiment saying ""My mother is not expendable.""And your mother is not expendable"" he continued. ""And our brothers and sisters are not expendable. We're not going to accept a premise that human life is disposable. We're not going to put a dollar figure on human life.""The core of Patrick's argument to get back to normal is that the response to the outbreak is more damaging than the pandemic itself. It has been echoed by a number of others including right-wing commentator Jesse Kelly who tweeted that he'd ""happily die"" if the choice was either death or ""plunging the country I love into a Great Depression."" Laura Ingraham one of Fox News' most prominent prime-time personalities tweeted that health officials ""should not be the determinative voices in policy making now or at the end of 15 days.""Elsewhere Sen. Ron Johnson R-Wis. told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that even a mortality rate as high as 3.4 percent from the illness does not justify shutting down major parts of the economy. And Lloyd Blankfein the former top executive at Goldman Sachs tweeted that those with a lower risk of death should return to work within ""a very few weeks.""On Monday Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr. a top evangelical ally of Trump's welcomed more than 1000 students back to his university in Lynchburg Virginia from spring break even as classes move online.Trump's frustrations with the economic downturn first spilled into public Sunday night when he tweeted in all capital letters that ""WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF."" By Tuesday Trump was delivering his clearest time frame telling a Fox News town hall that he'd ""love to have"" the country ""open by Easter"" which is a less than three weeks away.The push comes as White House aides feel they are in a no-win situation. If the administration pushes to ease restrictions it could be blamed for increasing deaths as the virus spreads. But they see far-reaching consequences for having Americans stuck at home for weeks or months.Beyond the economic impact administration officials warned about the effect on children who have bad home lives or the health effects from the physical and emotional stress on people who have lost their jobs a White House official said.Already some administration officials say they worry that the White House went too far in allowing public health experts to set policy and that their actions need not have been so draconian. The number of total confirmed cases in the U.S. is right about 50000 according to Johns Hopkins University.What's less clear is whether Trump has the ability to quickly alter the country's course aside from using the bully pulpit.Governors and local officials have implemented shutdowns although many are following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In many places school systems are shuttered for the rest of the school year while restaurants bars gyms and other large gathering places have been closed. Meanwhile private industry has instituted its own instructions during the pandemic.""Fun fact: since Donald Trump didn't actually close anything down he can't actually open anything up"" Ron Klain who served as the Ebola czar in the administration of President Barack Obama tweeted.Speaking to reporters Tuesday Larry Kudlow Trump's top economic adviser cautioned that the president is looking to reopen swaths of the economy in places that have not been hit as hard by the virus adding that the administration is ""not abandoning health professionals' advice but there is a clamor to try to reopen"" the economy.It's difficult to know exactly which places are safer from the virus as it has a lengthy incubation period while widespread testing still has yet to fully take off.The push runs counter to the messaging from health experts including some in Trump's administration. On Friday the nation's top infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said he ""cannot see that all of a sudden next week or two weeks from now it's going to be over.""""I don't think there's a chance of that"" he said adding that any change is at least several weeks out.Meanwhile Sen. Lindsey Graham R-S.C. one of Trump's closest congressional allies tweeted Monday: ""Try running an economy with major hospitals overflowing doctors and nurses forced to stop treating some because they can't help all and every moment of gut-wrenching medical chaos being played out in our living rooms on TV on social media and shown all around the world.""""There is no functioning economy unless we control the virus"" he added.For his part Cuomo did suggest that a strategy in which some elements of the shutdown are loosened — with less vulnerable people returning to work — may be possible in the coming weeks if both the public health and economic approaches are ""done intelligently."""

Bernie Sanders may be ready to debate former Vice President Joe Biden but the frontrunner and current delegate-leader in the Democratic primary thinks it may be time to move on. In a virtual press conference with campaign reporters on Wednesday Biden responded to Sanders’ latest signal that he’s staying in the race by wanting to participate in an April Democratic debate. A debate has not yet been scheduled due to the coronavirus pandemic. “I think we've had enough debates. I think we should get on with this” Biden said after noting that his focus since stepping off the campaign trail two weeks ago has been devoted to the coronavirus crisis.Biden and Sanders remain as the only two Democratic candidates still vying for the nomination as the campaign trail has come to a halt. While Sanders continues to mull staying in the race his announcement to debate Biden and organizing investments in New York suggest he will remain a competitor at least through April’s primaries.On Tuesday Biden said on MSNBC that he intends to continue to campaign regardless of how long Sanders stays in the race. “As I said from the beginning that's not for me to decide” Biden said. “I'll continue to make the case why I think I could be president and should be president now and make the case for it. It's in a sense putting all politics aside.”

Forty-eight percent of registered voters prefer Biden while 45 percent prefer the president — however that lands within the poll's margin of error. The poll did not release data on how Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders fared in a general election stand-off with Trump. The picture changed slightly when the poll shifted to key state voters. According to the poll 50 percent of voters in 300 ""swing counties"" — counties in which less than 10 points separated Trump and 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton — back Biden while just 41 percent support the president. Trump and the leading Democratic candidate essentially split the current vote for Independents — Trump edges out with 45 percent and Biden garners 44 percent. While the possible general election contest is extremely close some key questions could end up affecting whether voters change their allegiances. Twenty-five percent of registered voters said their current financial situation was best described as ""struggling"" and just 12 percent of registered voters said their financial status was improving. That could magnify as the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic has some experts saying unemployment could reach 20 percent in a worse-case scenario situation. However it's not clear that Americans blame the Trump administration for their financial situations. Fifty-two percent of registered voters said the federal government had ""no real impact"" on their finances and 29 percent said the government ""helped"" their financial situation. The Monmouth University poll was conducted between March 18 and March 22. Both candidates have also seen upticks in their favorability since February. Forty-six of registered voters view President Trump either very or somewhat favorably up two points since February and 43 percent of registered voters view Biden very or somewhat favorably up three points from the last poll."

151,Opinion: NPR's Evolving Coverage Of Live White House Coronavirus Briefings,ELIZABETH JENSEN,NPR Opinion,-1,https://www.npr.org/sections/publiceditor/2020/03/26/821327277/opinion-nprs-evolving-coverage-of-live-white-house-coronavirus-briefings,"KUOW an NPR Member station in Seattle said earlier this week that it will no longer air the daily White House Coronavirus Task Force briefings live. The announcement was both praised and condemned by listeners who contacted the Public Editor's office.Overwhelmingly the listeners who have reached out to my office have asked that NPR itself cease airing the briefings as a routine practice echoing calls elsewhere for the live coverage to stop. But some managers at Member stations report the opposite; their listeners want to hear the full briefings live. We've heard that from listeners too particularly in response to KUOW's announcement.The public radio debate at least that which I have heard is heated but the arguments are also as thoughtful as you'd expect coming from station employees who take their public service role seriously and listeners who are seeking out trustworthy information sources.The debate breaks down into three broad threads. One is that the briefings have become less newsworthy over time. While the briefings do in part provide important updates from officials as the nation attempts to conquer a raging pandemic they can be meandering and contradictory and the president has at times also used them to spread falsehoods and air personal grievances. KUOW in making its announcement cited ""a pattern of false or misleading information provided that cannot be fact checked in real time"" as its reason for discontinuing the live broadcasts. (It also said the decision was not politically based and that it would ""revisit this decision daily."")An alternative view is that NPR's role is to bear witness no matter what the news is. Live airing of the full briefing allows citizens to hear directly how their federal government is handling this crisis. Listeners get to decide for themselves the value of the information shared perhaps by listening to NPR's later analysis.A third argument I've heard from listeners is that by not airing the briefings live NPR would be ""censoring"" the administration.First some backgroundThis may be pedantic but it's important context: When I talk about NPR I am referring to the decisions that are ultimately made in the D.C. newsroom. Those decisions mostly play out in what is heard on the weekday and weekend versions of Morning Edition or All Things Considered the midday Here and Now on npr.org the hourly newscasts or in so-called ""special coverage"" when NPR goes live for breaking news.But NPR is also something else. It is a constellation of more than 1000 public radio stations around the country such as KUOW that are licensed to local communities or community organizations such as universities. They contract with NPR to provide national and international news coverage but fundamentally they make local decisions responding to the needs of their communities. That's per their mandate from the Federal Communications Commission which has the power to take away those licenses to use the public airwaves. Not every community has the same wants or needs.An ethical approachIt's a specious argument that not airing the briefings is tantamount to censorship. It's not as if NPR would be refusing to report any news coming out of the briefings if it did not carry them live. The daily news shows and hourly newscasts have reported extensively on what the president and others have said during the briefings and continue to do so.One listener wrote to us equating the COVID-19 briefings to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's World War II fireside chats. But the two situations are not equal nor is the media environment the same. Unlike in the 1940s when newspapers and radio were the only major news sources we are now in an era of abundant media outlets; the briefings can be seen or heard on npr.org or myriad other places. They can be watched live or after the fact. (That said there are indeed some media consumers in rural areas who do not have cable or broadband connections and who rely on public radio airwaves to receive news. That's where local community station decisions come in.)Both of the other arguments have merits and the good news is that technology makes it easier to satisfy both camps. It's important to see the government at work. But increasingly the briefings are being held around 5:30 p.m. ET which is the heart of the first airing of All Things Considered. By cutting away to carry the live feed from the White House NPR has had to jettison other valuable reports on how the country is responding to this crisis as well as other important news. (And as an aside I think NPR has been doing an excellent job covering this wide-ranging story from the science to the financial ramifications to the very personal impacts on people's lives.)Moreover there is that question of misinformation. If NPR runs a 90-minute briefing live how many listeners are sticking around for the analysis context and fact-checking afterwards? The NPR newsroom's self-defined mission is among other elements to ""serve the public and democracy."" I take that to mean that it should provide facts to help listeners make decisions in their lives not spin particularly at a time when public health is at stake. That means having its reporters listen to the briefing and immediately share important updates in the newscasts and newsmagazines without giving a platform for falsehoods or speculative comments on as-yet-untested treatments or campaign rally-style rants. Those who want to can watch the full briefing at npr.org (albeit without that all-important context) and NPR has made the link easy to find sending out breaking news alerts among other things.Earlier this week NPR was taking a middle road on air: preempting All Things Considered to air the first minutes of the daily White House briefing which are generally the most news-filled and then cutting back to the newsmagazine partway through the briefing to provide analysis of what was said. That is better than running the entire briefing live but a better public service would be to simply stop the live broadcasts and report on what is said later using the same news judgment as for any story. Of course NPR could still do what it always has done: break into its regular programming if the briefing warrants.Those are my opinions and mine alone. Here's what the newsroom told me yesterday via an official statement:""We make our editorial coverage decisions based on the news environment in any given hour on any given day; our decision regarding providing live coverage of the White House daily COVID-19 briefings is no different. Today we have decided to lean into our original reporting and analysis on our daily programs like Morning Edition and All Things Considered while offering our Member Stations a live stream of the White House briefings on a separate channel but our coverage decisions will continue to evolve daily.""Here's my translation: No live coverage of the briefing last evening but that could change in coming days depending on the circumstances. Stations that want to can run the live coverage on air or online. I approve."
152,Opinion: I'm An American Stuck In Peru — Glad To Be On Lockdown To Avoid COVID-19,DYLAN BADDOUR,NPR Opinion,-1,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/24/820085325/opinion-im-an-american-stuck-in-peru-glad-to-be-on-lockdown-to-avoid-covid-19,"Dylan Baddour is a freelance journalist covering South America who is now stuck in Cajamarca Peru because of the coronavirus outbreak.It was time to give up our adventure and head home to Texas. Every village in the Peruvian highlands was buzzing with talk of the spreading coronavirus. South American countries were starting to close their borders.So my partner Pu Ying Huang and I headed out of the Peruvian countryside and into the small city of Cajamarca where we hoped to quickly find a flight home. But when we got there at night on March 16 it was too late.Peruvian President Martín Vizcarra had just declared a total quarantine for 15 days halting all air and land transportation even taxis. With fewer than 150 cases of coronavirus identified at the time the Andean country was immediately going into lockdown to stem the spread of the virus. (As of Tuesday Peru — with about 32 million people — has identified 395 infection cases and five deaths from COVID-19 the disease caused by the virus.)Suddenly we were among the thousands of Americans stuck in Peru.Police guarded the bus terminal prohibiting departures. Hotels shut. Desperate to get indoors for the night we were saved by a woman who waved us into her small family hotel.The next morning there were soldiers with masks outside and police cars patrolling with loudspeakers that repeated ""This is an emergency please stay in your homes."" One day later Pu and I moved into an Airbnb with a kitchen and stocked up on groceries to hunker down.A Facebook group popped up for Americans stuck in Peru and more than 2300 people put their names on a Google Doc that circulated to register us. While my partner and I felt fine some others wrote that they were running low on medication or needed to get home to their work or family. Whereas countries including Colombia Mexico Israel and France chartered flights to get their people out of Peru the Americans could not make contact with our embassy.""We are calling the embassy every single day and no one is answering the phone today. Seems as if everyone's left already"" wrote one of the group members on Friday. Others expressed outrage over the limited information they were receiving.Starting this weekend the U.S. State Department has helped evacuate 700 of the more than 5000 Americans in Peru since the weekend according to the Embassy. On Monday U.S. Chargé d'Affairs in Peru Denison K. Offutt said via Twitter that the remaining U.S. citizens in the country should stay where they are and await outreach from the Embassy. But on Tuesday the Embassy said the repatriation effort was delayed because of problems obtaining permission from Peru to land planes.We have followed the daily White House briefings where U.S. leaders often insisted what a great job they were doing but stopped short of announcing a national lockdown. The U.S. suspended incoming flights from China and Europe. By now individual states and cities have closed public schools and some businesses urging residents to isolate themselves.By contrast on Friday in Peru President Vizcarra addressed his nation in a speech that sent his popularity skyrocketing. He insisted on the urgency of the quarantine then chastised those Peruvians who disregarded it and the local authorities who didn't enforce it ""with the strictness this situation requires.""He said he had designated about $30 million to acquire 1.4 million Chinese coronavirus tests to locate and isolate outbreaks. (He later said 330000 would arrive on March 27 and the rest in April.) Seven 20-story towers on the main avenue of the capital city Lima would be turned into a 3000-bed emergency hospital. Three million poor families were identified to receive immediate cash assistance as the quarantine kept them from work.Vizcarra dismissed and replaced his health minister saying the situation required someone with particular expertise in public health and viral infections.Early on TV news broadcast scenes of workers protesting over being forced to stay home and sacrifice their daily income. However experts commenting in the media seemed unanimous in acknowledging the need of the drastic quarantine to avoid a national outbreak.In the next few days TV news showed images of residents on their apartment balconies cheering on police and public health enforcers in the streets.Some neighboring nations followed the cue: Colombia and Argentina went into total quarantine when they each had fewer than 200 identified cases of coronavirus at the time. (As of Tuesday Argentina has identified 301 cases and four deaths and Colombia reports 306 cases and three deaths.)We remain 14 hours away from Lima down highways blocked by the military. When we poked around for underground transportation in that direction Peruvians seemed not to like our efforts to undermine their quarantine. All advised us firmly to wait until the lockdown was lifted.What scares us most is the life we may encounter when we get to the U.S.Peru's swift shutdown of intercity travel is likely to help reduce the spread of the virus.The government's actions the nation's solidarity and seriousness of its approach have raised our hopes that the quarantine will expire as planned on March 31 and the disaster will be controlled enough to permit limited travel for folks like us to return home.At least the measures here mesh with the lessons The New York Times drew from a study of Italy the new epicenter of the virus: ""that steps to isolate the coronavirus and people's movement need to be put in place early with absolute clarity then strictly enforced.""U.S. infections have surged each day yet the federal government has remained reluctant to impose drastic actions. Other countries such as Italy and Spain have enforced quarantines but too late to stop COVID-19 from ravaging them.Our friends and families in the U.S. have said we may be better off in Peru. Still we feel this is the time to be with our families and we hope to get home.When we do get out what scares us most is the life we may encounter when we get to the U.S."
153,When Cancer And Coronavirus Collide: Fear And Resilience,MORHAF AL ACHKAR,NPR Opinion,-1,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/22/818863524/when-cancer-and-coronavirus-collide-fear-and-resilience,"It's like being in prison inside a prison. Having advanced cancer while being wary of the COVID-19 virus really sucks. I am speaking both as a doctor and as a person with cancer – since 2016 I have lived with stage 4 lung cancer.The threat of cancer hangs in the air like a gun to your head. It makes you think about risks and survival odds. It forces you to confront the fact that you may die sooner than you'd imagined.It's a terror that the coronavirus is only making more palpable. COVID-19 is another reminder of the fragility of our lives. And even if a person with cancer manages to look away from the idea of mortality the virus will bring it back into view.Your body is already tired from ""fighting"" cancer. And your mind has very little bandwidth to decide if the question arises which enemy is more dangerous: the cancer cells or the virus.In fact for people with malignancies especially those treated with chemotherapy it is impossible to separate the two threats. They are among the most vulnerable in this epidemic because chemo can weaken the immune system. They are exposed to a higher risk than the general population and we need to pay attention to them.Even before this epidemic people with cancer already had many challenges and unmet needs. Cancer and its treatment often leave patients with pain fatigue and limitations in terms of what they can do on a day-to-day basis. Many patients deal with emotional and mental health difficulties.Financial stress is a challenge for most but the affluent especially if they have to reduce their work hours or stop working altogether.Navigating the complex health system and the often inadequate health insurance only adds to the burden of living with the illness.This epidemic will make the struggle of cancer patients worse. In places where social distancing is recommended they need to stay home. They may be forced to stop working if they can't work from home or they may face layoffs. They could end up losing their health insurance.Patients who depend on others for basic needs like shopping and transportation may find less reliable help as their aides isolate themselves or become sick.Those who receive emotional support and information from centers that provide in-person services could be cut off from immensely needed resources.Most important medical care will likely be jeopardized when the health-care system becomes overwhelmed. Many experts have started talking about advanced cancer patients not receiving life-saving care if the situation of scarcity becomes real. This is all scary to the cancer community.Yet people with cancer are perhaps better prepared than many to face an existential threat. We've developed resilience and learned to live in the here and now. When you confront your mortality you realize that life is finite — there no time but to become your true authentic self. You start to judge what you do by your own standards and express yourself truthfully.You also become empowered to claim a voice to advocate for yourself and the community. Because if you don't speak up perhaps no one will.This epidemic is isolating people who were already isolated and we need to find ways to stay connected with them. Reach out virtually to your friends especially the ones who are struggling or those who have serious illnesses. Say hi and tell them you are thinking of them.We can try to make room for everyone to express their raw emotions their honest feelings. Let's find creative ways to do that. Art and writing can help some and so does humor. Listening to the person who is suffering is also good. Do not jump to volunteer solutions. Just be there and listen.We can stand in solidarity with those who suffer. We can advocate to ensure accommodations are made for those who need them and that the essentials are available for everyone.I am sure someone needs grocery shopping transportation or a cooked meal. If you have two rolls of toilet paper or two containers of hand sanitizer give one of each to someone who needs them more.I drove around Seattle tonight and oh how much I miss the old city! And it's only been a couple of weeks. I know that our resilient city will again be lively and active. But in the interim we mustn't forget those living on the margins.This epidemic reminds us that no one is immune to illness. When we are busy trying to survive individually let's not forget the other person and especially let's not forget those who have been ill for a while.As our society faces an illness that is serious and devastating we cancer patients can share a few lessons from dealing with our infirmities. With support and care you can find the strength to carry on. You keep going and you give it your best shot. And always try to remember: Today is a gift."
154,Opinion: Missing The Shared Jokes Small Talk Midday Laughs Of The Office,SCOTT SIMON,NPR Opinion,-1,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/21/819439605/opinion-missing-the-shared-jokes-small-talk-midday-laughs-of-the-office,"I miss work. I know as I say this that I'm blessed to have rewarding work as a lot of Americans suddenly don't. Working from home for most of the week has made me marvel at how much so many can do these days on laptops and small screens.But spending most of the workday in bedroom slippers pondering whether to shave shampoo or even brush my teeth — because after all who'll see me besides my family? — also reminds me how much we can miss the walls cubicles hallways and most of all the people in our workplaces.Those of us sheltered with our loved ones know we're lucky. But marriage vows after all are only ""to love and to cherish till death do us part"" not hour after hour day after day no matter how many crumbs you might trail in from the kitchen all over the place.I miss work. I miss the shared jokes small talk and midday laughs. I miss the morning smiles and jokes in the elevator which are not always elevated. I miss the security guard who shows me pictures of her cats and nephews. I miss the birthday cakes for our colleagues the card smuggled from staffer to staffer to be signed the pop of a cork and the off-key serenade of the birthday song (when it was a song not a measure of hand-washing time).I miss work. I miss the eye rolls and asides from the people around me the comic gripes and moans the occasional confidences and confessions. At NPR we have work that may be more important to do than ever and we're fortunate to have this job especially as we report on how many Americans may soon lose theirs. But I miss the chortles and cackles of people who work together rely on one another and learn how to make each other laugh.We watch more news at home than ever. So many of the commercials that run between news stories look as if they're from a world that no longer exists. Millions of people locked down inside while commercials still show people going places buying things high-fiving and hugging because they found a neat new toothpaste.All the amazing things that can now be done remotely may just remind us how human beings are still really wired together by the actual proximity of companionship: the small incidental notes of life that connect us in our work the bright smiles that can light the grimmer corridors of life.As Stephen Sondheim wrote ""It's the fragment not the day. It's the pebble not the stream ... That is happening."""
155,Opinion: Early Coronavirus Testing Failures Will Cost Lives,CLAYTON DALTON,NPR Opinion,-1,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/14/815727231/opinion-early-coronavirus-testing-failures-will-cost-lives,"The other night I had a patient in the ER where I work come in with fever cough and shortness of breath. It would have been a routine visit if not for the novel coronavirus currently sweeping the globe. The patient was concerned about the virus and so were we. She had recently traveled to a conference in a country with known cases of COVID-19 as the disease caused by the coronavirus is called. She was middle-aged and had HIV which we worried could increase her risk of serious illness from the virus. We contacted the department of health where all testing in my state is currently performed to request permission to test for the coronavirus.The verdict? Denied.Since the patient did not require hospital resources like an oxygen mask or IV fluids we discharged her home urging her to self-quarantine and return if her symptoms worsened.Every ER doctor that I work with already has several stories like this. This week in Massachusetts testing has been permitted only for patients with respiratory symptoms requiring hospitalization or for patients with such symptoms who have traveled to endemic areas or had contact with confirmed coronavirus cases. Similar criteria apply in other states. The problem with this approach is that according to all indicators it is almost certainly missing a large number of cases.Strong evidence suggests that the coronavirus is already spreading within the community and has been for weeks. After the first confirmed case appeared in the United States on Jan. 20 scientists in Seattle who had been collecting swabs to study influenza went rogue and against the directive of the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed a test and began looking for coronavirus in their flu samples. In late February they quickly found their first positive — a teenager with no recent travel and no sick contacts. Genetic sequencing of the virus by the same researchers suggested that the virus had likely been circulating in the community for as long as six weeks.Now cases with no recent travel and no known contacts are emerging everywhere. Earlier this week public health experts from Johns Hopkins confirmed that the virus is likely spreading undetected in the community. Put another way this thing is probably out of the barn.If that's the case then why are we still facing such strict limitations on who we can test? There isn't a clear answer but it seems to be a function of a woefully inadequate supply of test kits. In other words what few tests we do have are being rationed for the people who need them most like those requiring hospital admission. While South Korea has run nearly 250000 tests and has capacity to test 10000 people per day current estimates suggest the United States has performed only about 19000 tests. Here's another way to express just how far behind we are in terms of testing — as of March 11 the United States had performed only 23 tests per million people while the U.K had performed 347 per million Italy 826 per million and South Korea 3692 per million according to an analysis by multiple media outlets and the COVID Tracking Project.Ashish Jha director of the Harvard Global Health Institute told NPR on Thursday that the United States' response has been ""much much worse than almost any other country that's been affected."" He reached for words like ""stunning"" ""fiasco"" and ""mind-blowing"" to describe the situation.This leads to a second much more important question — how were we so staggeringly unprepared to test for this virus? A number of hiccups have contributed. First many test kits released by the CDC on Feb. 4 were defective. Designing and manufacturing these tests is challenging and sometimes problems arise. There have been reports that early Chinese tests may have had a false negative rate as high as 50%. But rather than encourage university labs and private companies to help with test development the FDA withheld permission for such work until Feb. 29. Contrast this with the response in South Korea where a private biotechnology company began developing a test on Jan. 16 had a working version ready by Feb. 5t and had government approval for use one week later. That company is manufacturing enough kits to test a million people per week.Private companies and academic labs are now developing their own tests. The Cleveland Clinic recently announced it had developed a rapid test for the virus. But concerns are mounting about a shortage of critical materials needed to run these tests.The total failure to ensure that adequate testing would be available will likely prove to be the single most important factor in why the United States has been unable to contain the outbreak. As previously reported by NPR Hong Kong Singapore and South Korea all deployed an aggressive testing strategy very early on. This allowed them to find the first few cases and isolate them preventing unchecked community spread. Because our government and public health authorities were unprepared we have missed that precious opportunity in the United States and it is going to cost people their lives.This failure represents a profound abdication at the highest levels of government of responsibility to the health and security of the American population generally and of more vulnerable populations especially. Public health experts have known of the exceptional risk posed by novel coronaviruses for more than 20 years but the current administration limited funding to the CDC and disbanded a White House unit expressly dedicated to preparing for a pandemic just like this one. Public statements from the top echelons of our government — false comparisons to seasonal influenza wildly misleading promises about access to testing reassurances that everything is ""perfect"" — continue to seed confusion and erode trust.The most stunning illustration of this radical failure of leadership and responsibility occurred for me Thursday morning on C-SPAN. CDC Director Robert Redfield was testifying in front of Congress and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz was asking who was responsible for ensuring that those who needed to be tested could be tested. After several attempts to dodge the question Redfield fell silent. He had no answer. He stared down at his desk before slowly turning to a man seated next to him. It was Anthony Fauci director of infectious diseases at the NIH. He had the courage to say what Redfield wouldn't.""The system is not geared to what we need right now"" he said. ""And that is a failing.""What do we do now? We should still emphasize scaling up testing capacity in a massive way. Knowing exactly who has the disease will enable more effective quarantines protect vulnerable populations and mitigate community spread. But the most critical measures occur at the individual level. Everyone should practice social distancing. That means curtailing all social interaction canceling organized gatherings working remotely switching elbow bumps for handshakes and keeping a distance of several feet from others whenever possible. Everyone should also practice obsessive hand hygiene. That means washing your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds on a regular basis and every time you come into contact with high-traffic areas like a doorknob or subway pole. Avoid touching your face for any reason — use a tissue to scratch an itch.If you have any cold or flu-like symptoms like fever sore throat cough or muscle aches you should wear a mask if you have access to one isolate yourself keep washing your hands and avoid contact with others as much as possible until at least two to three days after your symptoms have resolved. If you develop difficulty breathing chest pain profound weakness or confusion then it's time to seek medical attention.Community spread in the United States is already occurring and the virus will likely reach a large number of people. But this is not the nightmare scenario. The nightmare scenario occurs if lots of people get sick at the same time. This could lead to a massive surge of ill patients arriving at hospitals all at once which could easily overwhelm resources like oxygen tanks ventilators and intensive care unit beds. If this happens then people will die who otherwise might have recovered. Some European countries are already facing a situation like this. It is imperative that we spread out infections over time or flatten the curve. This way hospitals will have adequate resources to treat everyone and won't become overwhelmed. How do we flatten the curve? All of the individual actions I described above.We're all in this together. If everyone does their part in limiting further spread lives will be saved.Clayton Dalton is a resident physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston."
156,Opinion: Refugees Are Especially Vulnerable To COVID-19. Don't Ignore Their Needs,MUHAMMAD H. ZAMAN,NPR Opinion,-1,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/11/814473308/opinion-refugees-are-especially-vulnerable-to-covid-19-dont-ignore-their-needs,Muhammad H. Zaman (@mhzaman) is a professor of biomedical engineering and international health at Boston University and the author of Biography of Resistance: The Epic Battle Between People and Pathogens to be published by Harper Wave in April.The message about coronavirus to the public is loud and clear: If you feel sick call your doctor. There is nothing wrong with the message. But not everyone has the luxury of calling a doctor.In some of the places I have worked in the last few years — particularly in understanding barriers to healthcare in refugee camps in Pakistan Uganda and Lebanon — the ability to call a doctor does not exist. When I recently contacted a friend who helps provide primary care to refugees at the Syrian-Lebanese border to ask about pandemic-related anxiety in the camp he asked me a question in response: How do you wash your hands several times a day when there is no access to clean water in your entire camp?The challenge of COVID-19 is testing countries governments and their citizens in new and unprecedented ways. Schools have been closed from Italy to Japan Iran to Ireland and more recently in the U.S. Universities including Boston University where I teach are moving all classes to an online format. Federal and state governments are recommending a ban on large gatherings. Conferences are being postponed and sports events are canceling at unprecedented rates to decrease the likelihood of disease spread.But what happens if your home is in a confined refugee settlement?The impact of armed conflict on health systems and infrastructure is well known. Hospitals are destroyed medical personnel are either killed or forced to flee supply chains for medical equipment and medicines are disrupted. This is in addition to increased injuries and trauma as well as greater exposure to infectious agents and unhygienic environments.People who are forced due to armed conflict or other reasons to flee their homes can end up living in cramped environments with little access to medical care. Infections and superbugs thrive in such environments and patients typically can't obtain appropriate and quality antibiotics.While there are no known cases yet of COVID-19 in refugee camps — which is likely due to a lack of testing — the disease is going to hit these communities hard.Despite global attention to the challenges posed by the coronavirus and increasing calls to support low- and middle-income countries refugees are largely ignored and left to their own devices. A global approach is needed to avoid more tragic loss of life.The global health security agenda too often focuses on the security of the rich and the powerful — not those who have no political agency. Because refugees are not citizens of countries that host them little has been discussed about how nearly 30 million people should prepare for this outbreak — or the next. It is not even clear what if any resources are available to refugees to seek proper information let alone proper care.Beyond the obvious ethical and humanitarian dimensions in providing information and care for those who have been forcibly displaced from their homes there is another obvious reason to support refugees in managing the COVID-19 pandemic.Refugee settlements tend to have a high population density and are often close-knit communities. As a result any outbreak can spread quickly. With an increase in the number of refugees who seek work in urban areas and routinely travel back and forth between camps and cities the problem could quickly escalate.Underlying health issues stemming from poor nutrition or lack of vaccination can make refugees even more vulnerable. Secondary infections including those from drug-resistant pathogens are also common in these environments. An outbreak would also increase the likelihood of infection among staff at clinics schools and humanitarian agencies who work in refugee settlements. The workers and staff could in turn infect others in their own communities.The obvious and sustainable solution is to improve the health system in these camps so refugees can receive equitable care. Given the urgency of the situation this is unlikely to happen overnight.What can happen — and will mitigate the risk — is a three-pronged approach.First there must be a recognition that refugees are highly vulnerable to this outbreak. International public health agencies in partnership with local health authorities must ensure that accurate information and practical advice is provided to these communities in a clear easy to understand and transparent manner. This would require efforts by countries and international agencies in bringing together experts in infectious diseases and refugee health to come up with a clear plan to tackle a possible (and likely) outbreak.Second national and international funding that is being mobilized to fight the coronavirus should include resources for refugees and forcibly displaced communities. This can come in several forms including the creation of new temporary health facilities near refugee camps setting up screening centers and mobilizing additional health workers. Refugees are unlikely to have disposable income and many would therefore not be able to travel or pay for out-of-pocket expenses for testing.Refugees also can face high levels of discrimination and xenophobia in some host countries — another reason why testing and care should be given close to the camps. It should not require extensive travel to areas where refugees are reluctant to go due to fear of physical and emotional harm.Finally and perhaps most importantly the United Nations World Health Organization regional agencies and local health authorities must build trust with refugee communities at this time. Research shows that trust plays a central role in how refugees (and other vulnerable groups) seek health care. To create trust refugees need access to information and to knowledgeable care providers who speak their language and have a strong sense of empathy.Top-down heavy-handed approaches that involve heavily armed police or security agencies with a history of using disproportionate force are unlikely to work. Instead partnerships that include refugee community leaders and community representatives are going to be far more effective in managing the crisis.We are in uncharted territory and it remains to be seen how the virus is going to spread. However it is clear that taking care of vulnerable and marginalized groups will not only help manage the COVID-19 crisis better by reducing the degree of global spread and protecting those at risk; it may also pave the way for improving the health and well-being of refugees well beyond this crisis.
157,Opinion: 1 Unfathomable Toll Of The Coronavirus Outbreak — Dying Alone,SCOTT SIMON,NPR Opinion,-1,https://www.npr.org/2020/03/07/813113958/opinion-1-unfathomable-toll-of-the-coronavirus-outbreak-dying-alone,"The toll of coronavirus in the U.S. and around the world is being told in the numbers of people who have died been infected tested or quarantined — and the economic costs of canceled events vacations and travel. But there's another consequence that's harder to categorize.At least 10 residents of the Life Care Center of Kirkland Wash. have died from the virus; more may have died without being tested. Older people including those with respiratory problems are considered to be especially vulnerable.Family members of the residents have told reporters they've been given inadequate or inaccurate information about their loved ones inside even as they say they understand how health care workers in the home must be overworked and anxious too.But the hardest part might be that they can't see in person — can't touch or hold — the person they love who may be in pain and scared and confused as they die alone. It may be like seeing somebody drown at a distance.""We are watching from the shore and not being able to do anything"" Alex Stewart whose 95-year-old grandmother lives in the nursing home told The New York Times. ""It is a very helpless feeling.""Vanessa Phelps' 90-year-old mother lives in Life Care and has breathing difficulties. Her daughter couldn't even speak to her. She told ABC News: ""It's horrific. My mom being there all alone it's just heartbreaking and it's unacceptable what they're doing""This may be a problem that causes anguish and outrage but has no immediately apparent solution. If families were permitted inside the home to be with their loved ones they would likely be exposed to the virus too which would risk a vast increase of the number of people who could be infected.Still it's hard to know that someone you love is dying but you cannot give them the only comfort you'd wish: your touch; a few loving words; your presence beside them as a kind of last thanks for all the times that they as a parent or grandparent brother or sister stood beside you during the challenges and passages of life.I don't know of any statistic that can account for the number of people this virus may force to die alone. But it is one more burden to carry not only for those who may die over the next few weeks and months but their loved ones who must go on."
158,Working Together To Alleviate 'News Deserts',ELIZABETH JENSEN,NPR Opinion,-1,https://www.npr.org/sections/publiceditor/2020/03/06/812096584/working-together-to-alleviate-news-deserts,"Last week I wrote about the listeners we heard from who want to hear more varied perspectives — from outside the DC beltway and the coasts from rural areas — and some developments that I find hopeful. Here's one more.NPR is rightfully proud that over the years as other national news organizations have cut back on national correspondents around the country it has kept open many of its domestic bureaus and reporter positions from Birmingham Ala. to Boise Idaho. But that still means that roughly three dozen people are responsible for covering wide territories and correspondents often need to parachute in when major news breaks.At the same time it didn't escape the notice of many that NPR has a network of 265 stations (as of this week) around the country that pay dues to air its programs and that those stations collectively have some 1800 local journalists of their own. While reporters at some of those stations were tapped regularly to file reports for NPR others were not. The untapped potential seemed huge.A few years ago dreamers began to scheme: What if those two assets could be brought together somehow in a more closely aligned reporting system? Bruce Auster NPR's senior director for what came to be named the Collaborative Journalism Network calls it the ""power of the national-local blend.""After countless delays needed to work through myriad challenges the vision for that network is turning into reality in the form of regional and statewide hubs of public radio stations with NPR as a partner. In just the last month a new hub in California that brings together five stations and NPR announced that it had hired a managing editor. A similar regional hub in the Gulf states of Louisiana Mississippi and Alabama also was formally unveiled. They join a statewide Texas hub which launched last fall. Others are under discussion.The developments are good news for listeners everywhere whether you live in a hub region or not.If you are a listener to a local station taking part in one of these hubs the potential benefit is major. Ideally the pooled resources of statewide and regional stations will allow for less duplication of effort freeing up reporters and editors to do more original reporting in their communities. The hubs are unlikely to replace the granular local community reporting that is being lost as small town newspapers fold but on the bigger local stories they seemingly have great potential to fill holes in what are now becoming vast news deserts in much of the country.Auster said the chief goal of the hubs is ""to strengthen local and regional journalism."" He called it ""very much an effort to fill the gap left by the contraction of the newspaper industry.""While not the main goal in theory some of that great reporting should filter back to NPR's national newsmagazines. For the national NPR listener the hoped-for payoff is reporting resources on the ground in place to spot stories as they happen and bring local knowledge and depth to that work. The hub reporters can also respond immediately to breaking news.A complex modelI did my first interviews for this column two years ago when after what had already been a couple of years of work it seemed that the first hub was imminent. As the delay since then underscores the issues around these collaborations are incredibly complicated reflecting the realities and complexities of the public radio system itself.A few of the challenges the participants have talked to me about:Many listeners mistakenly believe that NPR and member stations are already one entity with NPR controlling everything heard on a station's air. In fact stations are independent entities (and stations in turn oversee NPR as the dominant group on NPR's board of directors). The stations have broadcast licenses granted by the Federal Communications Commission based on their service to their local listening areas.Some stations are what's known as community licensees with local citizen governing boards that have a fair amount of freedom to enter into new ventures. Other stations are licensed to universities or other educational institutions and thus must work within the priorities of the parent organization which may or may not include improving the country's news ecosystem.Money is a perpetual challenge for public radio and while stations have reporters the new hubs need editors and other infrastructure and the hubs need to be sustainable over the long run. Does that money come from the stations and parent institutions? NPR? The Corporation for Public Broadcasting which administers federal funding for public broadcasting? Can the hubs raise their own funds say through sponsorship or grants? (Each hub has a different model but the answer is yes to all of the above.)Issues of control are complex. For example a local reporter has a news director who decides reporting priorities. What if the hub editor wants to take that reporter off a local story to work on a regional one? Similarly many local stations are used to competing on some stories but now they're being asked to work more closely together on some coverage. In some cases reporters may have to take a back seat on a story they've built up sourcing on over the years.The relationship between NPR and station hubs has its own challenges of control. Who decides which stories go to the national newsmagazines? What if a national correspondent has her or his eye on the same story or a newsmagazine wants the story told a different way?NPR whose reporting adheres to an extensive ethics code also needs to have confidence that reporting it is getting from elsewhere follows those guidelines. This has been a recurring concern over the years when NPR has taken stories from outside sources some of which have different standards. Concurrent with the planning for the hubs public radio leaders embarked on what they called ""Culture of Journalism"" training to ensure that public radio journalists systemwide are all on the same page.If this sounds like a lot of inside baseball it is. But confronting these challenges (each hub is doing so in different ways) early on is a key to making the ventures work.As Joyce Slocum the president and chief executive of Texas Public Radio in San Antonio (and a former top NPR executive) put it during a panel discussion at September's Excellence in Journalism conference the conversations had to start from a premise that ""this was not a project; it was a way to do business from now on."" Participants had to ""check their egos at the door"" and remember that as public media they are ""mission- and listener-centered"" she said.Auster told me that all the planning work that had to be done to get the Texas hub off the ground led to a template for other hubs which is why they are coming together more quickly.Where they standIn California the hub's new managing editor Joanne Griffith will start by coordinating statewide breaking news coverage and local and regional coverage of the 2020 election for the five participating stations in San Francisco Sacramento San Diego and the Los Angeles area. She'll also loop in work from the smaller stations in the state. The big-city participating stations are all fairly well off when it comes to resources (four of them already collaborate) and the venture says its goal is to increase coverage of statewide issues and ""boost reporting from and for underserved regions across the state."" Griffith will work closely with the NPR West Bureau Chief Jason DeRose who will edit stories for national broadcast.In the Gulf WBHM in Birmingham Ala. Mississippi Public Broadcasting WWNO in New Orleans WRKF in Baton Rouge La. and NPR are joining together to increase regional coverage; the work is designed so that all NPR member stations in Louisiana Mississippi and Alabama can take part. Hiring is about to begin; new positions include a managing editor six beat reporters and two editors.The Texas Newsroom is furthest along. It already produces six live statewide newscasts every weekday drawing on content from public radio stations across the state. The newscasts are carried by about a dozen stations. The stations also share in-depth reporting that airs on the daily newsmagazine Texas Standard.That collaboration already paid off in one breaking news situation when a gunman opened fire in El Paso Texas last August killing 22. Thanks to the coordinated communication lines already in place the newsrooms were able to get local reporters to the scene more quickly. NPR sent just one reporter where it normally might have sent more ""because we felt the coverage was in good hands"" NPR's Auster said.Auster emphasized that while there are core stations taking the lead at each hub all stations in each region are welcome to participate contributing reporting and taking content.Good news for listenersThese hubs are building on public radio regional and state and topic-specific collaborations that are already extensive from Harvest Public Media to the Mountain West News Bureau to the Environment And Energy Collaborative from NPR and member stations (to name only a few).Just in my five years as NPR's Public Editor the growth in quality reporting from these many ventures has been impressive and a great service to journalism. The Collaborative Journalism Network should bring more of that good local work to NPR itself. For all of those listeners who reached out after last week's column to add their voices to those who are hungry for more outside-the-Beltway perspective this is good news."
159,Personal Essay: Coronavirus Lockdown Is A 'Living Hell',A RESIDENT OF WUHAN,NPR Opinion,-1,https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/03/809965742/personal-essay-from-wuhan-living-in-hell,"Editor's note: The author of this essay asked for anonymity for fear of reprisals by authorities for speaking critically of the Chinese government.As residents of Wuhan China my family and I are living in hell.The city has been locked down for more than a month. Every night before falling asleep I have been confronted by an unreal feeling and many questions:I know that coronavirus is the reason for the lockdown — but did life in Wuhan have to become a living hell?Why were we notified about the city lockdown at 2 a.m. on the second to last morning before the Lunar New Year?Why have I not been given any instructions from a government officer about how to cope when an entire city is on lockdown?I'm nearly 30 years old. My family members and I have devoted ourselves to our jobs to build a better life — and we have largely succeeded. There's only a little more to do before we reach the level of middle class.But along the way things did not go exactly as I'd hoped. I have been working hard in school since I was small. My dream was to become a journalist and I passed the test to enter the best school for journalism in China.After school I learned that government supervision of the media meant that telling the truth was not an option. So I gave up my dream and turned to another career.I kept telling myself that my hard work would reward me in my personal life. And to protect myself I decided to shut up to be silent about politics — even when I saw people treated unfairly by the government. I thought that if I followed that path I would be secure I would be one of the fortunate ones.Now I realize that this is an illusion. A secure life is not an option with a political system that does not give us freedom to speak out and that does not communicate with us truthfully.Now I realize that this is an illusion. A secure life is not an option with a political system that does not give us freedom to speak out and that does not communicate with us truthfully.Wuhan residentAt the moment when the city was first locked down I hoped with all my heart that China's political system known for concentrating resources to get big jobs done could save the Wuhanese. But infected patients were treated in the hospital in Wuhan as early as the beginning of December and for unknown reasons the government held off informing the public and taking effective action.So they missed the best window of prevention due to this cover-up.That knowledge has made me fall into desperation. The order to lock down the city appeared from nowhere on Jan. 23 at 2 a.m. without any sign or explanation to residents — even though everyone knew what was up.People rushed to shop at 24-hour convenience stores at 3 a.m. to gather necessary food and other items. We tried every method to escape from Wuhan but the cage was already locked.On new year's eve Jan. 24 I watched the glorious performances from a gala aired on CCTV Chinese television. But our celebratory meal was sparse pieced together from the few ingredients I'd been able to buy in that last-minute shopping trip.Then on the second day of the new year another order arrived out of the blue notifying us that the Wuhanese shall not drive. But this order only survived for less than six hours — perhaps because the authorities realized that with public transportation shut down cars would be needed to drive medical staffers to work and back home. So community officers called upon residents of Wuhan to provide rides for many of these workers — and to get permits to do this driving. Under the pressure of massive criticism the government had to revoke this order for residents to provide rides.Other orders were issued that reflected the chaos. Residents were asked to donate rice and oil to feed the medical staffers at Wuhan's top hospital since there was not enough food to guarantee meals for them. But we are the taxpayers. Shouldn't the government be able to provide?From former schoolmates who now work in the medical profession I learned that medical workers were not given medical supplies and were exposed to a risk of death. Many people wonder: Why didn't they go on strike? It is because they were informed that if they went on strike their licenses to practice medicine would be revoked and their family members' jobs would be affected.Before this coronavirus I always thought it was OK to sacrifice some level of democracy and freedom for better living conditions. But now I have changed my attitude. Without democracy and freedom the truth of the outbreak in Wuhan would never be known.Before this coronavirus I always thought it was OK to sacrifice some level of democracy and freedom for better living conditions. But now I have changed my attitude. Without democracy and freedom the truth of the outbreak in Wuhan would never be known.Wuhan residentWhat has happened in Wuhan is as if your house caught on fire and all your neighbors knew but forbade you from jumping out of the window. Only until the fire is out of control and the entire town ablaze do they slowly begin taking responsibility while highlighting their own heroic efforts.Not everyone has the same privileges and rights. Because I knew how to get outside of the Great Firewall that blocks the Internet I was able to obtain masks.The younger generations born after 1995 and in the 2000s have good impressions about the Chinese system putting the nation before all because they have been living in an era of prosperity and have yet to experience adversity.The things that happened during this outbreak have greatly surprised those kids. For example a young man scolded others on Weibo in the early days of the outbreak. He accused them of spreading rumors and argued that if we don't trust the government there is nothing we can trust. Later he said when a member of his family was infected with the coronavirus but was unable to get treatment in the overcrowded hospital he cursed and called for help.When Li Wenliang one of the doctors who first reported a mysterious SARS-like illness died of the disease himself a student commented on the Internet: ""It was just the virus that killed him so we should focus on the epidemics."" But then the student's dormitory was appropriated for quarantine patients — and he was shocked and dismayed.This is the lesson these young people are learning. When someone says we can accomplish something but we must pay a price do not rush to applaud.One day you may become the price that is paid.There is a saying in Chinese that has taken on new meaning in this coronavirus era: ""When the stick hits my own head I finally understand the pain — and why some others once cried out of pain.""Perhaps it is true that only China can build a hospital in 10 days only China can mobilize so many people to devote themselves to the anti-epidemic agenda only China can lock down a city with millions of people at lightning speed.But people are not thinking critically. They do not understand that if we had human rights democracy and freedom we would have learned about what happened in Wuhan one month earlier.

She is the author of Fateful Triangle: How China Shaped U.S.-India Relations During the Cold War.Following President Trump's two-day trip to India his first official visit to the country there's been some debate about its value. This is not unusual for U.S.-India leader-level trips which — more so than in the case of other countries — seem to be measured on the basis of whether they produce a big deal.That may be the result of the last big deal — a U.S.-India civil nuclear initiative laying the groundwork for the two countries' current strategic partnership.Those hoping this time for a big deal — specifically a trade one — will be disappointed. Trade negotiators had moved some way to reaching a mini-agreement but had not been able to get it over the finish line.Those concerned — whether from a strategic economic or democracy and human rights perspective — about internal developments in India will also be disappointed. Trump mentioned the importance of Indian diversity multiple times in his speech on Monday and acknowledged that concerns about religious freedom and India's months-long detention of political leaders in Kashmir were discussed privately. But he refused to publicly comment on the Hindu-Muslim violence that erupted in Delhi during his trip — the worst in decades resulting in at least 20 deaths — and seemed to support what he said was Modi's desire for ""people to have religious freedom.""Nonetheless for those worried about trade frictions primarily over tariffs and the trade deficit harming strategic cooperation there is cause for relief. To assuage Trump Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasized growing economic ties and a reduced trade deficit. Indian CEOs highlighted their investments in developing skills and manufacturing in the U.S. and their effort to keep Chinese equipment out of India's 5G network.A joint statement released Tuesday seems to point to a ""phase one"" trade deal in the near future and suggested progress on consultations that would help keep China's telecom giant Huawei out of India's 5G infrastructure. President Trump also noted that the two sides would work toward a more comprehensive trade agreement at the end of the year.Those looking for continuity in the two-decades-long trend toward greater strategic cooperation between the two democracies will also find reason for optimism. Spurred by shared concerns about terrorism and a rising China's actions in the region the U.S. and India have deepened defense and security ties over the last three years.Announcements during the visit expressed determination to continue this cooperation particularly in the Indo-Pacific as well as in a revived homeland security dialogue.Both sides will be pleased with India's decision to purchase some $3 billion worth of U.S.-made military helicopters for its navy and additional Apaches — Delhi because the former involves a transfer of technology; Washington because this is the first Indian defense deal completed during the Trump administration.Given their shared concerns about China's giant infrastructure project the Belt and Road Initiative they also announced that the new U.S. International Development Finance Corporation will establish an office in India to cooperate on regional infrastructure projects including renewable energy ones in India. And the U.S. Agency for International Development and its Indian counterpart will cooperate on development projects in third countries.For Modi the U.S. is strategically crucial particularly in maintaining a favorable balance of power in Asia. He has made considerable effort to keep Trump on his side. During the president's visit this was visible in the red-carpet welcome that included a massive audience. It also was evident in Modi's highlighting of deals ($70 billion in civil aviation defense education and energy) in a way that Indian prime ministers rarely do with the U.S. And it was clear from the lack of public criticism when Trump made positive comments about Pakistan.India's efforts with the president clearly paid off — at least during the visit. Trump was highly complimentary of India and the prime minister despite Modi's recent political and economic setbacks. Trump also downplayed trade differences refrained from publicly pressuring India to exclude Huawei from its 5G network and gave Modi the benefit of the doubt on domestic developments — something the president has been known to do with leaders he admires like China's Xi Jinping.Trump himself will likely feel he has made some political gains — even if not with Indian-American voters who largely vote Democratic. Parts of his Ahmedabad speech on Monday and remarks on Tuesday — highlighting divinity defense deals and how his trip would help combat illegal opioid production — seemed designed for his base back home. His campaign has already been using the visit to highlight the president's favorability abroad (and in a recent Pew survey Trump almost matched Obama's rating in India).But it was clear from Trump's remarks toward the end of the visit that his trade concerns with India have not disappeared. If Trump is re-elected Delhi will need to be prepared that these issues will be on top of his list with an expectation of greater concessions. Meanwhile both sides will need to be prepared for headwinds — whether they come from developments within the countries or from black swans like the coronavirus."
161,House to pass $2 trillion coronavirus package after chaotic sprint to D.C.,HEATHER CAYGLE and SARAH FERRIS,Politico Time,-1,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/27/house-vote-2-trillion-coronavirus-package-deal-150869,"The House is on track to pass a sweeping $2 trillion coronavirus relief package Friday that will provide immediate assistance to workers small businesses and major industries on the brink of economic collapse amid the ongoing pandemic.But the House vote wasn’t without some last minute drama as members from across the country scrambled to return to Washington amid worries that a single lawmaker would force a roll call vote which could delay quick passage.House leaders said Friday morning they still hoped to pass the massive package via voice vote around noon. But they had implemented a contingency plan — including asking lawmakers to return to Washington and instituting safety precautions inside and around the chamber — in case that wasn’t possible.The 11th hour drama in the House comes after days of frenzied negotiations between Senate leaders to secure a deal and an intense behind-the-scenes lobbying effort by House leaders to ensure none of their members tried to delay the bill.""We're going to pass it today. We will respect the congressional traditions and we will have a little longer debate than we had anticipated and that's a good thing” Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told reporters as she entered the Capitol on Friday morning.House Republican leadership is concerned that GOP Rep. Tom Massie — who argues that voting without a quorum is unconstitutional — will call for a recorded tally. Multiple Republican lawmakers and aides expect Massie to call for quorum.Massie a libertarian-leaning gadfly frequently at odds with leadership drove from his home in Kentucky to be in Washington for the vote and was spotted sitting in the chamber when floor debate kicked off Friday morning.“I understand there’s a quorum here so I think we’ll be fine” said Rep. Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.) a member of the GOP whip team who’s been in touch with Massie. ""I've been trying to talk him out of it.""President Donald Trump lambasted Massie in a series of tweets Friday calling him a “third rate grandstander” and suggesting Republican leaders boot him out of the party.“He just wants the publicity. He can’t stop it only delay which is both dangerous & costly” Trump tweeted.Several conservative hard-liners rushed to defend Massie with Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) telling Trump to ""back off."" And the House Freedom Caucus put out a statement opposing the massive rescue package a further sign of GOP agitation.The bill aims to prop up virtually every sector of the U.S. economy in response to a pandemic that has shuttered businesses fueled massive layoffs and disrupted nearly every aspect of American life.The measure provides a significant — albeit temporary — expansion of unemployment benefits a one-time cash infusion for most Americans and emergency federal funding for food aid hospitals and schools and universities. The package also provides a $500 billion lifeline to major industries including airlines $350 billion for small business loans and $150 billion for state and local governments.“This is about all of us as Americans not as Republicans or Democrats” House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said in floor remarks Friday.Emotions ran high as lawmakers took to the floor. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Mich.) — who made the nearly nine-hour drive to D.C. overnight — refused to stop speaking after she went over her time limit shouting into the chamber even as Hoyer tried to allow her to extend her remarks.“I rise before you wearing these latex gloves not for personal attention not for personal attention but to encourage you to take this disease seriously” Stevens said holding up her hands to show the gloves.“I rise for every American who is scared right now” Stevens said raising her voice as she attempted to be heard above the banging gavel.Ahead of the vote Friday dozens of lawmakers made a mad dash to Washington driving overnight from states like Massachusetts Indiana and Rhode Island and boarding red-eye flights from California and Arizona.Members initially thought they would have until Saturday to arrange travel back to D.C. if a Republican did indeed demand a tally of the vote. But that plan was scrambled Thursday afternoon when Pelosi announced to members on a caucus call that she planned to pass the bill Friday.Lawmakers of both parties fumed at Massie as they sought last-minute flights grudgingly making plans to return to the Capitol even as they feared it could increase the risk of spreading the coronavirus among their own ranks.Rep. Pete King (R-N.Y.) tweeted that Massie's possible move was ""disgraceful"" and ""irresponsible.""""Because of one Member of Congress refusing to allow emergency action entire Congress must be called back to vote in House. Risk of infection and risk of legislation being delayed"" King complained on Twitter.Officially more than 80000 Americans have been diagnosed with coronavirus including Reps. Ben McAdams (D-Utah) and Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). But health officials expect the actual number of cases to be far higher and rising.Even before voting on the latest relief package top Democrats were already talking about the need for a fourth bill to help rescue the economy. Just Thursday the Labor Department released record-high unemployment numbers with jobless claims surging to 3.3 million last week.But some Republicans including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) have tried to downplay the prospect saying they don’t know if there will be a need for a “Phase 4” bill.Pelosi seemed undeterred telling reporters at her weekly press conference Thursday that she planned to forge ahead with the legislation working mostly from Washington and hoped the other congressional leaders — McCarthy Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (D-Ky.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) — can work with her on a deal.After passing the relief package late Wednesday the Senate adjourned until April 20. The House is also expected to be out for several weeks if not longer.In the days leading up to the vote both Pelosi and McCarthy had strongly urged members in conference calls and in individual conversations not to object to the voice vote which they said would still allow for a debate and a chance to vote in opposition without forcing hundreds of people on planes.House Republican leadership spent hours on Thursday attempting to mollify concerns within their conference convincing members like Colorado Rep. Ken Buck to oppose the bill on the floor but not force a vote. But Massie remained elusive refusing to tell GOP leaders what he planned to do.Worried about Massie or another lawmaker trying to force a roll call vote House leaders had prepared contingency plans. Both parties’ whip operations kept a careful count of who was able to return and whether they could reach a quorum on the floor.Over the last week several Democrats had urged their leadership to allow for remote voting. Pelosi has been firmly opposed to the idea however and has said that lawmakers who are able — after consulting with their own families and doctor — should return to the Capitol to vote.The voting process will look vastly different than the House’s normal procedure. Members will vote in groups of no more than 30 members at a time in an attempt to limit exposure to other members.Lawmakers were required to use hand sanitizer before and after leaving the chamber Friday. And only members who were scheduled to speak were allowed to sit in the chamber. Even on their way to votes lawmakers were asked to ride with no more than one other person in an elevator.And the Sergeant-at-Arms and the Capitol physician announced strict rules to keep members at least six feet apart at all times. But as floor debate began Friday it was clear not all members were following the rules.Melanie Zanona contributed to this report."
162,Now I’m Unemployed’: How Coronavirus Killed Off the Capitol Hill Internship,JORDAN MULLER,Politico Time,-1,https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/03/27/coronavirus-capitol-hill-internship-151162,Congress’ frenzied effort to respond to the coronavirus crisis has been one of the most furious sessions of lawmaking in history. Just days after a congressional staffer tested positive for the virus the House passed a bipartisan coronavirus response bill securing food aid free access to testing and extended paid time off for vulnerable Americans. On the other side of the Capitol building senators and their aides remained at work deep into the night this week negotiating the specifics of the $2 trillion economic rescue package they passed unanimously late Wednesday night — and which the House is expected to vote on as early as Friday morning.Noticeably absent from the hubbub? Congressional interns whose semesters on the Hill have ended abruptly in response to the coronavirus.For thousands of students the coronavirus has disrupted the usual flow of college life forcing students from their dorms leading school administrators to cancel graduation ceremonies and driving professors to their laptops to wrap up their classes via video conference. But for those students who had lined up internships in Washington this semester efforts to stop the spread of the coronavirus have disrupted or outright canceled what those interns had hoped would be a foot in the door for a post-collegiate job in politics.“I’m pretty much in limbo” said Wayne A. Rodriquez Jr. an American University student who interned in Rep. Jim Himes’ office this semester until two weeks ago when his internship abruptly ended due to coronavirus fears. “I don’t really know where to go from here because I was supposed to carry on and now I’m unemployed.”Unlike their colleagues in staff jobs who are federal employees interns are totally discretionary — each office hires its own — even as they are subject to many of the same centralized rules that apply to staffers. Similarly it’s left to each individual congressional office how to handle coronavirus — whether that meant a premature end to internships a work-from-home arrangement or something else entirely. So almost at random as some of their offices swung into furious action and some went into hibernation interns found themselves on the outside.While some congressional interns have been forced to work from home others have been furloughed or had their program cut completely. Those who are out of work join the swelling ranks of Americans who have lost their jobs in recent days and whose career prospects remain uncertain as the economy tumbles and businesses shut down.By March 12 the day after a Senate staffer tested positive for the coronavirus some congressional offices had begun ordering their staff to work remotely. For some interns whose programs are managed by individual offices that marked an unceremonious end to their short semester on the Hill.“[That] was my last day and I was only in [the office] for like two hours” said one congressional intern who like most interviewed for this article spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press and feared that doing so could hurt their career prospects. “I didn’t even say goodbye to anyone.”For young politicos congressional internships are something of a rite of passage — the first rung of the ladder in a career in government and politics. Each semester hundreds of college students flock to congressional offices to answer phone calls and emails give tours to constituents draft press releases research legislation and schedule appointments. Many of those tasks are impossible to do remotely and even among those interns who were able to retain their positions it’s impossible to access the secure congressional computers and networks necessary to do many of their usual daily tasks.“To go from working eight or nine hours a day to doing two or three hours of work if that is pretty difficult” said one House intern who’s working remotely and still getting paid. “I’m used to doing stuff all day and now I’m doing nothing.”Another House intern told POLITICO that he’s been out of work for a week and a half since his member’s office began working from home. He’s still receiving a monthly $500 stipend but can’t access his House email account remotely and hasn’t been assigned any work. In the meantime he’s waiting out the crisis at his mom’s house in Maryland and preparing to apply for other jobs in D.C.Capitol Hill long known for its close quarters where members and staff mingle collegially as a constant stream of visitors pass through is seen as particularly vulnerable to the spread of the novel coronavirus. Members must vote in person even as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urges Americans to gather in groups of no larger than 10. The average age of a House member is nearly 59; for Senators it’s 63. Two House members and one senator have already tested positive for the virus with dozens more in self-quarantine.Congressional offices often hire interns from the pool of students in Washington-area colleges. But those schools like most across the country have shut down to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Some of the region’s largest colleges including Georgetown George Washington University Howard University and American University are shuttering their dorms and shifting classes online — leaving students scrambling to figure out their housing situations move out of the dorms and wrap up their internships.One student at GW whose House internship ended two weeks ago said that even if their member’s office returns to in-person work they won’t be able to live in D.C. to finish their internship: They’ve already moved all their belongings out of the dorm flown home and the college will not let students move back.Another student a Senate intern who is now working remotely took the semester off from college to intern on Capitol Hill. He had been living in dorm-style housing with six other congressional interns who are now unable to work from their members’ offices. After a few days cooped up with his roommates unable to get work done — or even to seek a reprieve by taking his laptop to the neighborhood Starbucks — he packed up his belongings and moved out of the dorm to stay with relatives in the area.“I’m hoping that this isn’t the end of my internship” he said. “I guess it really makes me value the ability to be able to do in-person work experience a lot more.”
163,Trump calls for ousting GOP congressman from party ahead of coronavirus relief vote,QUINT FORGEY,Politico Time,-1,https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/27/trump-congressman-thomas-massie-coronavirus-vote-151523,"President Donald Trump on Friday called for ousting from the Republican Party a GOP congressman who has signaled that he could hold up an impending House vote on the Senate's $2 trillion coronavirus emergency relief package.""Looks like a third rate Grandstander named @RepThomasMassie a Congressman from unfortunately a truly GREAT State Kentucky wants to vote against the new Save Our Workers Bill in Congress"" Trump wrote on Twitter.House Republican leadership has been concerned that Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) will move to demand a recorded tally as opposed to a voice vote on the historic stimulus measure throwing a last-minute obstacle in the legislation's path to the president's desk. The threat has forced dozens if not hundreds of lawmakers to return to Washington from their home districts traveling on interstates and through airports at a time when public health officials have urged Americans to avoid travel and large groups.""He just wants the publicity. He can’t stop it only delay which is both dangerous ... & costly"" Trump tweeted of Massie. ""Workers & small businesses need money now in order to survive. Virus wasn’t their fault. It is 'HELL' dealing with the Dems had to give up some stupid things in order to get the 'big picture' done. 90% GREAT! WIN BACK HOUSE but throw Massie out of Republican Party!""In another message the president sought to target Massie's status as chairman of the conservative House Second Amendment Caucus. ""By empowering the Radical Left Democrats do nothing Kentucky politician @RepThomasMassie is making their War on the 2nd Amendment more and more difficult to win (But don’t worry we will win anyway!). He is a disaster for America and for the Great State of Kentucky!"" Trump wrote.POLITICO previously reported that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) had been in contact with Massie and that the White House was aware of the obstacle he posed to the package's final passage.Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) announced on Thursday that the House would vote Friday on the legislation sending lawmakers scrambling back to the Capitol after they were previously told they would have at least 24 hours' notice if they needed to return.Any single member could complicate the proceedings on Friday by objecting on the grounds that there isn't a quorum — in this case 216 lawmakers — in the chamber or by demanding roll call vote an option opposed by congressional leadership of both parties. But even if Massie forces a recorded vote the bill is expected to pass with wide bipartisan support."

Full team info below. And don’t forget: add @MorningTech and @PoliticoPro on Twitter.TECH OF THE TOWNThe Covid-19 stimulus package is expected to pass in the House today. Here’s everything you need to know.IN WHAT WORLD? ROBOCALLERS PREY ON THE PANDEMIC — Yup. Some people still have the nerve even during the biggest health crisis of our lifetime. Robocalls and robotexts are skyrocketing as the coronavirus continues to claim lives — some misleadingly offering testing and masks (hard to come by) cures (nonexistent) and more.— What we’re seeing: Transaction Network Services a company that analyzes trends from more than 1 billion calls every day shared with MT some of the top Covid-19 phone scams making the rounds. One pushed in over 500000 calls in a day last week was about how the virus would affect your student loans TNS senior director of product marketing Jim Tyrrell told us. One widespread in Los Angeles has offered coronavirus safety and medical kits and one pervasive in Texas has offered incorrect Democractic primary voting dates. (Not hard to sow confusion about that given the pandemic has already forced at least a dozen states to move their presidential primaries.)A large number of robocalls and robotexts have also offered free iPhone 11s free Netflix for five months house cleaning to get rid of the virus and health insurance or loan scams tied to the virus Tyrrell said. (WaPo reported an estimated 1 million or more coronavirus-related robocalls daily in recent weeks.)Despite New York being the current epicenter of the outbreak the areas being hit hardest by these coronavirus scams are Phoenix; Norfolk Va.; and Ft. Myers Fla. according to Tyrrell.— What we’re doing: Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) this week called on the FCC and Justice Department to use their “critical new robocall deterrent and enforcement powers” to address the fresh onslaught. They’re referring to the new authority afforded under the Pallone-Thune TRACED Act S. 151 (116) legislation that President Donald Trump signed in December that is aimed at beating back illegal robocalls.“These calls pose a serious threat to consumers’ well-being and risk exacerbating the current coronavirus public health crisis” the senators both authors of the TRACED Act wrote in a letter to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai and Attorney General William Barr. “Robocalls that spread misinformation about cures peddle ineffective equipment and offer bogus medical advice have the potential to inflict significant harm on individuals and communities across the country.” They asked for a reply by April 2 on the FCC and DOJ’s next steps.— Meanwhile: The FCC is launching an advisory committee this summer focused on working with voice service providers and federal and state governments to fight robocalls to hospitals. The Hospital Robocall Protection Group established as a result of the TRACED Act is seeking nominations for potential members and leadership (through May 1). “The idea that robocallers would clog up hospital phone lines with a flood of nuisance calls seems unthinkable but it is a reality” Pai said this week. “In the face of the current pandemic … the last thing [health care facilities] should have to worry about is receiving robocalls that distract from performing their mission.”Sign up for POLITICO Nightly: Coronavirus Special Edition your daily update on how the illness is affecting politics markets public health and more.FCC PLUGS IN ON TELEHEALTH — The FCC on Thursday announced it’s extending the application for its Rural Health Care Program which helps subsidize connectivity for health care providers a move aimed at ensuring the country stays plugged in while the pandemic keeps spreading. “The disruption to health care providers throughout the country as a result of this pandemic is indisputable and the FCC alongside other federal agencies is working to address these challenges head on” Pai said in a statement.— Pai is also ready to welcome the $200 million coming at his agency as part of the Hill’s coronavirus relief package expected to go to a Covid Connected Care telehealth pilot. “The FCC has already begun preparing for this bill to become law” he said.— And on the airwaves front: The commission also authorized AT&T to tap into airwaves belonging to DISH Network to help boost its service in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.WHAT’S IN A NAME? DEFINING ‘ESSENTIAL WORKERS’ — The tech industry is calling on policymakers to come to a consensus on which professions qualify as “essential workers” in Covid-19 response efforts — and pushing for tech workers to make the cut.— As cities and states have one by one instituted safety measures in recent weeks — ranging from closures of “non-essential” businesses to stay-at-home orders for “non-essential” workers to strict shelter-in-place mandates — the Information Technology Industry Council and other trade groups have pushed for information and communications technology workers to be exempt in order to continue supporting health care workers educational institutions and government entities central to the country’s war on the virus. (Recent CISA guidance on essential workers includes many from the ICT field but the council says that guidance has not been consistently enforced.)— “Services provided by the technology industry are crucial to every aspect of response to the current crisis – from health care to emergency communications to remote work to distance learning and more” said ITI’s president and CEO Jason Oxman. “We urge leaders at every level of government in economies across the globe to adopt clear and comprehensive guidance for ICT workers in their jurisdictions. Doing so will ensure these men and women are designated as ‘essential’ so they may continue performing their critical jobs and functions including keeping local communities safe secure and connected.”SMALL-BUSINESS GROUP SAYS BIG TECH ISN’T BAD — Some of Silicon Valley’s critics argue that the pandemic has made one thing clear — the vast power that Facebook Google and Amazon command over the internet. The government has leaned on Facebook and Google to disseminate public health messages; Amazon rankled some sellers when it chose to prioritize health and medical products over other goods.— But Jake Ward president of the Connected Commerce Council isn’t buying it. “There's certainly evidence that is more pronounced today than it was two months ago that large technology platforms ... are critical components of the infrastructure” he said. “But that doesn’t foreclose choice and it certainly doesn’t stop competition.”— Ward’s 16-month-old advocacy group represents 5400 restaurants retailers and other small businesses that use the internet. And it notably counts Amazon Google Facebook and Square as supporters. Ward says that their reach is not anticompetitive but instead allows small businesses to achieve greater scale.— Plus he says the financial impact of the pandemic on major internet companies could prove that they’re vulnerable to rivals. “If and when there is a marketplace that has a monopoly it in theory can defend itself against something like a worldwide recession without falling victim to competition eating into its market share” he said. “In the next two months we're going to find out.”FACEBOOK TO SCOTUS: DON’T TAKE SECTION 230 APPEAL — The social media giant told the Supreme Court it doesn’t need to weigh in on a high-profile case over the scope of the law that shields tech companies from liability for user content. In a brief Wednesday Facebook said a decision last year by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is in line with how other courts have interpreted Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act and the justices shouldn’t bother with the case.— “At the end of the day petitioners’ real plea is for this Court to rewrite §230 to narrow its scope” Facebook said. “‘Whether and to what extent Congress should allow liability’ ultimately ‘is a question for legislators not judges.’”— The case: A group of U.S. citizens sued Facebook over Hamas-linked social media posts that encouraged violence against Israel. The 2nd Circuit ruled that Section 230 barred the suit and plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court. Barr has highlighted the case in his criticism of tech’s liability shield.
165,Trade in a post coronavirus world,ADAM BEHSUDI ,Politico Time,-1,https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-trade/2020/03/27/trade-in-a-post-coronavirus-world-786439,"— The lasting trade legacy of the Covid-19 pandemic could be shorter supply chains and a more regional approach to trade as companies and governments look to overcome foreign reliance during times of crisis.— Customs and Border Protection backtracked on guidance that would give importers more time to pay tariffs on a case-by-case basis as the administration continues to weigh broader tariff relief.— Medline Industries one of the largest medical supply companies in the country said tariffs remain on key imports that could help in the fight against the coronavirus.IT’S FRIDAY MARCH 27! Welcome to Morning Trade where your host participated in his first virtual happy hour yesterday. Got any other ideas for virtual socializing? Let me know: abehsudi@politico.com or @abehsudi.DRIVING THE DAYTRADE IN A POST CORONAVIRUS WORLD: Shorter supply chains. Domestic manufacturing requirements. Export restrictions. All these things could be the norm in a world after a major pandemic that has emboldened economic nationalists and raised alarm from free-traders.“I think the direction of travel is pretty clear that supply chains are unlikely to be getting longer and more global in coverage. If anything they’re more likely to become more regional and shorter in distance” said Simon Evenett an economist at the University of St. Gallen in Switzerland who has been keeping track of the global trade response to the pandemic.The shortening of future supply chains may be a product of corporations seeking to avoid “location risk” as much as they are a result of government policies that seek to safeguard against future crises but deeper trade restrictions in the near term could prove to be more sinister.Export restrictions on medical supplies crucial for the fight against the pandemic have in recent days given way to new policies restricting food shipments in the face of panic buying. Vietnam has stopped exporting rice and Kazakhstan and Russia placed restrictions on grains and other staples.“All this leads to some potential uncertainty about food supply later in the year. If more countries start worrying about their own food supplies and protect what’s within their own borders then countries relying on trade may face real shortfalls later in the year” said Tim Benton a research director at the London-based Chatham House think tank.A delicate balance: Whoever occupies the White House in 2021 and beyond will face the challenge of pursuing a trade policy that balances the need for domestic health and security vs. the global economy. G-20 leaders on Thursday provided a careful response committing to “facilitate international trade” and coordinate a response that avoids unnecessary interference with traffic and trade.“Emergency measures aimed at protecting health will be targeted proportionate transparent and temporary” the statement said.Still the Trump administration has already shown it’s likely to use the crisis as reason to double down on policies that aim to shift supply chains back to the U.S. if the president wins another four years.""We need to fundamentally review our supply chains and make sure that we know those supply chains and have control over them for moments just like this"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on ""The Hugh Hewitt Show."" That includes reducing reliance on China for pharmaceuticals rare earth minerals nuclear equipment and ""a host of other things that are really central to American security"" he said.CBP BACKTRACKS ON EASING TARIFF PAYMENTS: U.S. Customs and Border Protection put out a pretty clear signal Thursday that tariff relief may not be on the horizon.This message is to ""notify the trade community that CBP is no longer accepting requests for additional days for payment"" CBP said in a Cargo Systems Messaging Service bulletin. The advisory came less than a week after CBP said it would give importers on a case-by-case basis more time to pay tariffs taxes and fees because of the pandemic.The updated guidance comes as the administration continues to weigh whether it will grant broader tariff relief amid the unfolding economic crisis caused by the coronavirus. U.S. lawmakers and businesses are pushing for a 90-day grace period on payments of all tariffs.DPA IS ON THE DL FOR NOW: The Trump administration is pushing back against pleas from governors and medical professionals to use the Defense Production Act to alleviate shortages of masks gloves ventilators and other crucial medical equipment insisting the private sector is stepping up.Adm. Brett Giroir a member of the White House coronavirus task force on Thursday defended the administration’s decision to keep DPA in its back pocket saying the federal government poured supplies into New York — providing the state with everything it needs including masks and ventilators.Manufacturers ‘agnostic’: “I’m completely agnostic on this front” National Association of Manufacturers President and CEO Jay Timmons said during a call with reporters on Thursday.“We are producing as much as we possibly can and whether DPA is in effect or not manufacturers are going to be compelled to do the right thing because we already are” Timmons said adding that he welcomes anything in DPA that could be helpful to manufacturers. He noted that the law includes provisions that potentially “might provide funds or grants or loans to manufacturers that are repurposing their facilities.""Pressure is growing: More than 100 former senior national security officials signed a statement on Wednesday urging the administration to use the law to ramp up production of medical supplies. Even traditional allies of the administration’s trade and manufacturing policies say the law needs to be used to produce more ventilators.“America’s manufacturers stand ready to produce needed medical hardware” Dan DiMicco chairman of the Coalition for a Prosperous America said in a statement. “Yet we’ve heard troubling reports that some multinational ventilator companies are sending supplies to other countries and opposing the use of the Defense Production Act (DPA) during this shortage.”Production delays: The four largest companies that produce ventilators in the U.S. are GE Healthcare Medtronic Allied Healthcare Products and Philips. Medtronic announced earlier this week it would double its production but the virus has disrupted supply chains in other countries.“In one particularly large country in Asia we have 50 percent of the employees actually able to get to the plant that actually makes circuit boards to go into our ventilators not a good situation” said Trevor Gunn vice president for international relations at Medtronic.MEDLINE SAYS TRUMP TARIFFS STILL AFFECTING SOME IMPORTS: Like other American companies Medline Industries was caught up in President Donald Trump's trade war with China leading to duties of up to 25 percent on many of its imported products.USTR recently granted many exemptions to those tariffs but the largest privately held U.S. medical equipment provider said some items that could be used to fight the coronavirus pandemic are still being taxed.Those include certain surgical drapes hospital plastics alcohol prep pads anesthesia circuit accessories needles and syringes and reusable gowns the company said.Jim Pigott divisional group president at Medline told the Trump administration at a July 2018 USTR hearing that the company could not accommodate increased duties on its Chinese-made medical equipment without cutting into its profits and raising costs for its customers.""Over time the tariffs will cause price increases for hospitals surgery centers nursing homes and individual consumers who purchase our health care products"" Pigott said.MEET SECTION 232’S OPPOSITE: SECTION 318: After two years of raising tariffs under Section 232 of a 1962 trade law and Section 301 of a 1974 piece of legislation Trump could actually remove duties to fight the coronavirus pandemic under Section 318 of the Tariff Act of 1930 the Congressional Research Service noted in a policy brief.That Depression-era legislation allows the president to authorize the Treasury secretary to waive tariffs on food clothing medical surgical and other supplies for use in emergency relief work during times of national emergency CRS said.U.S. lawmakers and businesses have been pushing for a 90-day grace period on payments of all tariffs including the ones Trump imposed on imports of steel and aluminum and goods from China. However Trump seemed to rule out that option last week.INTERNATIONAL OVERNIGHT— The Trump administration is nearing a rule that would further restrict U.S. semiconductor exports to China Reuters reports.— The U.S.-China blame game for the coronavirus pandemic is hampering efforts to respond to the global crisis The Wall Street Journal reports.— The European Commission asked EU member states to loosen restrictions on air cargo POLITICO Pro reports.— Trump has gone back and forth on whether to blame China or praise the country for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak POLITICO reports.— China will close its borders to most foreign travelers POLITICO Pro reports.— Chinese exports of essential hospital supplies declined 15 percent in the first two months of 2020 but it was not simply a case of China hoarding the equipment for itself or retaliating against the Trump trade war according to a new Peterson Institute report.— The U.S. government pulled back from a $1 billion ventilator deal The New York Times reports."

Claims were also high in the health care transportation and warehousing and manufacturing sectors. Pennsylvania led the country in unemployment claims with an estimated 378908 followed by Ohio (187784) and California (186809).Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin dismissed the data released Thursday in a CNBC phone interview saying the numbers are ""not relevant whether they're bigger or smaller in the short term."" In reference to Wednesday night’s passage of the Senate’s $2 trillion stimulus bill he added “the president is protecting those people.”Here’s the rub: There were more claims filed the week ending March 21 than in any other single week in a BLS data series that goes back to 1967. But even that tally doesn't capture the full economic toll of the coronavirus. That’s because laid-off workers have been calling into state unemployment agencies much faster than the agencies can process their requests.The disparities between the DOL number and ground-level reports can be enormous. For example New Yorkers seeking unemployment benefits placed more than 1.7 million calls last week to the New York State Labor Department the department reported Wednesday on Twitter. But according to DOL's count only 80334 New Yorkers applied for benefits. Also left out of DOL's count are newly-unemployed workers who aren't traditionally eligible for jobless benefits like independent contractors and gig workers and those who don’t meet wage and work eligibility requirements.More: ""Powell: ‘We may well be in a recession’"" from POLITICOAROUND THE AGENCIESWHERE’S SCALIA? Scalia “worked quietly but doggedly over the past week to clear a path for the coronavirus stimulus package that cleared the Senate Wednesday night” POLITICO's Ian Kullgren reports. “Now he's working behind the scenes to calm businesses' anxiety about the legislation.”Scalia “spoke with Uber executives about the possibility of extending unemployment benefits to gig workers” Ian reports. (The Senate bill provides these workers with temporary unemployment benefits.) And Scalia played some role in scaling back Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s push to give unemployed workers 100 percent of their salary benefits. In the final aid package that became a compromise proposal to give all workers $600 per week for up to four months on top of state unemployment benefits.A senior DOL official told Ian that Scalia has not talked to any labor leaders during this momentous month and unions report they haven’t heard much even from lower-level department officials. ""They haven't reached out to us that's for sure"" said Jonathan Battaglia assistant communications director for the International Association of Machinists.ACTING ICE CHIEF ON ‘THIN ICE’: Top Trump administration officials aren’t happy with Matt Albence the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement after he announced that immigration authorities would halt most enforcement efforts during the coronavirus outbreak POLITICO’s Daniel Lippman and Anita Kumar report. “He’s been on thin ice for some time” a person familiar with the situation said.ICE last week said it would prioritize deportation for foreign nationals who have committed crimes or pose a threat to public safety and not those at doctors’ offices and hospitals a move that “triggered worries about the political implications of adopting — even temporarily — an immigration stance similar to the Obama administration approach” Daniel and Anita write.After Albence notified lawmakers about the change in phone calls last week and the press release was issued he was chastised by acting deputy DHS secretary Ken Cuccinelli who later tried to walk back the statement.ON THE HILLHOUSE TO VOTE ON STIMULUS TODAY: The House today is expected to pass the massive coronavirus emergency package POLITICO’s Sarah Ferris Melanie Zanona and Heather Caygle report. The bill includes money for direct payments of $1200 to many Americans and $850 billion in loan programs for businesses. The bill would also allow workers to recieve up to 39 weeks of unemployment benefits.DEEP DIVE: “Here's what's in the $2T stimulus package — and what's next” from POLITICOWHAT'S IN AND WHAT'S OUT:— ""Virus Loans to Come With Union Neutrality Pledge for Companies"" from Bloomberg Law— “Senate bill leaves out OSHA rule for health care workers” from POLITICOWHAT'S NEXT?: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is already looking to forge ahead with a “phase 4” relief package that would expand the pool of people who qualify for family and medical leave add stronger worker protections for first responders and stabilize pensions among other provisions.Pelosi also said she doesn’t think “we’ve seen the end of direct payments” POLITICO's Heather Caygle and Melanie Zanona report ""and even raised the idea to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday of transmitting the first round electronically."" But Republicans have downplayed the need for more relief right now they write.IN THE COURTSNEW YORK COURT FINDS POSTMATES DRIVERS ARE EMPLOYEES: “New York state's highest court ruled on Thursday that delivery workers for the app Postmates are considered employees for the purpose of unemployment insurance” POLITICO’s David Giambusso and Dana Rubinstein report.""Postmates dominates the significant aspects of its couriers’ work by dictating to which customers they can deliver where to deliver the requested items effectively limiting the time frame for delivery and controlling all aspects of pricing and payment” the state Court of Appeals wrote.The ruling comes as gig workers in New York remain vulnerable to coronavirus-driven shutdowns and are largely ineligible for unemployment benefits. Although a state labor review determined in 2018 that three Uber drivers and those “similarly situated” were employees for the purposes of unemployment insurance New York hasn’t made it much easier for such drivers to actually receive benefits.IN THE WORKPLACESALARY REDUCTIONS FOR BUZZFEED EMPLOYEES: An internal memo to BuzzFeed employees Wednesday announced they will see pay cuts in April and May as a result of the coronavirus’ economic impact the Daily Beast’s Maxwell Tani reports. The cuts will be based on wage levels with those making $65000 or less getting the smallest cut while ""executives would take between 14-to-25-percent in pay reduction."" The company’s CEO Jonah Peretti said the move was made to prevent layoffs and said he “will not be taking a salary until we are on the other side of this crisis.”POSTAL SERVICELAWMAKERS SAY USPS COULD SHUT DOWN BY JUNE 2020: The United States Postal Service was struggling before the coronavirus hit but the pandemic's economic toll could force it out of business entirely. The House's stimulus package included aid for the postal service but Senate version does not the Washington Post’s Joe Davidson writes. Reps. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) and Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) said in a statement this week that without relief USPS could be out of business by June."

Congress is letting businesses skip paying their share of payroll taxes for the rest of this year to help keep them afloat and their workers on the job as part of a mammoth stimulus bill poised to pass the House today after unanimous Senate passage late Wednesday. All told it will amount to hundreds of billions of dollars in payroll tax cuts and deferrals which means foregone revenue for the Social Security program for now. Lawmakers defended their decision to make use of the payroll tax funds because of the extraordinary situation that has gripped the nation and they included plans to make the public pension plan whole again. But even with that backstop Social Security advocates foresee worrisome implications our Brian Faler reports.The issue isn’t simply money but also politics he writes noting workers’ widespread belief they’ve earned their Social Security benefits by paying their part of the dedicated tax. Employees pay half of the tax for Social Security and employers cover the balance. But that gets undermined when lawmakers replace it with other tax revenue.“It’s very dangerous for the whole foundation of the program"" said Chuck Blahous a former Social Security trustee. He warned that the program’s sustainability is risked by dialing payroll taxes up and down depending on economic needs of the moment. “Its political strength depends on this idea that the program is paying its own way” Blahous added.This doesn’t mark the first time the payroll tax has been redirected. In addition to suspending business payments of payroll taxes this year companies will also get to take a 50 percent credit against their payroll taxes to motivate them to keep employees working under the bill. Other recently passed legislation gives businesses payroll tax breaks to provide family and sick leave. Yet another bill aimed at the coronavirus economic crisis could provide a platform for further reducing payroll taxes which were cut during the Great Recession 12 years ago.REALITY CHECK: Mnuchin told CNBC Thursday the money would start going out “within three weeks.” But that would be a much faster start than the last time such payments flowed from the government when it took the IRS two months to issue its first payments in 2008 our Toby Eckert reports. It helps that direct deposits are more the norm now and a Senate Finance Committee staffer on Wednesday said the IRS was looking at prepaid debit cards or other options for people without direct deposit. The IRS might even partner with private industry to further speed delivery of direct payments said a source with knowledge of agency deliberations. “Tax banking payroll industry have all helped in the past on this kind of thing” the source said.Still the overall process could face slowdowns due to both longstanding and current IRS staffing factors. The agency’s overall workforce has shrunk for a decade alongside its budget — a headcount of nearly 95000 full-time equivalent positions at the IRS in 2010 plunged to about 73500 in 2018. Much of that decline came at the expense of audit functions rather than within processing roles but processing direct payments for the coronavirus is expected to take longer and prove more difficult because of the virus itself as management takes steps to protect employees. IRS service center workers who deal directly with tax returns and perform a host of other functions connected to tax filing are being cut back for coronavirus mitigation.Under normal circumstances more than 10000 of them operate full-time from nine sites and seasonal hires numbering close to 10000 swell the headcount this time of year to handle the extra workload. But to physically distance employees the IRS has started halving staff at service centers and other locations with certain essential functions. “For mission-critical operations that require people to be in a campus or work setting we will be immediately reducing staffing by approximately 50 percent to enhance social distancing” IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig said in a message to employees March 20.WHAT IT TOOK: Language to end a huge headache for the hospitality industry and retail sector — dubbed the retail glitch — is included in the economic aid legislation awaiting the House. Though both parties heard plenty of griping from affected industries Democrats heretofore had been content to let Republicans twist in the wind over the error’s longer write-off schedule for certain business investments rather than shortening the period as intended.Democrats remained chafed over getting sidelined in the buildup to 2017’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act but they planned to eventually fix the retail glitch for the right price — long thought to include expanding family tax breaks like the Earned Income Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit.But then everything changed with the U.S. economy plunging in recent weeks due to the coronavirus. Circumstances won out over Republican charm. “I guess it took a pandemic” a Democratic congressional aide told Morning Tax. Restaurant and retail traffic ground to a halt nationwide with customers opting to stay home or being told to while some state and local governments closed businesses in an effort to halt the spread of the disease. “Opposition on our side was thinned out by the mass economic slaughter of the restaurant industry etc.” another Democratic aide on Capitol Hill emailed. Supporters acknowledge they didn’t let a crisis go to waste.With Republicans in the Senate dug in on fixing the retail glitch and the bill largely driven by Senate negotiations Democratic pressure to increase refundable tax credits wilted. That’s not to say Democrats got nothing in exchange — they certainly count the sizable expansion of unemployment insurance as a big win. And as for the push for more generous EITC and CTC programs talk of another round of fiscal stimulus remains alive and well.Sign up for POLITICO Nightly: Coronavirus Special Edition your daily update on how the illness is affecting politics markets public health and more.AROUND THE WORLDMOTHER RUSSIA: New taxes on bank deposits will help pay for economic aid measures to blunt the coronavirus effects in Russia. The taxes will hit savings held by Russian pensioners and middle-class households the Financial Times reported. Russian President Vladimir Putin said just 1 percent of depositors would get hit by the tax on interest from deposits exceeding $12900 but according to the article millions of Russians will be affected.AROUND THE NATIONANOTHER STATE EXTENDS: Mainers will now get until July 15 to file their state income taxes matching the added three months for federal tax returns this year due to the coronavirus. Maine Gov. Janet Mills made the announcement on Thursday saying she hoped it would give taxpayers there “a measure of relief” according to a Portland Press Herald article. More than half of the states have now conformed to the federal tax extension announced last week the story noted."

But the current strain on the industry is only partly due to declining oil consumption tied to the coronavirus pandemic that has crippled the U.S. economy. The other factor largely is at the whim of a worsening global petroleum glut that the Saudis and Russia have stirred up after Moscow declined to extend oil production restrictions put in place by OPEC.Earlier this week several Republican lawmakers from oil-heavy states called for the Trump administration to increase pressure on Riyadh to end the ""economic warfare"" it was waging on American companies and they threatened to look into tariffs sanctions or pulling support for the Saudi war in Yemen if the kingdom didn't back off. But as Pro's Ben Lefebvre reports this morning even an aggressive diplomatic push would leave the U.S. with only so many leverage options.So far the administration has done little. Trump has acknowledged that although the U.S. industry was suffering the drop in fuel prices was like ""a big tax cut"" for consumers. Administration officials such as Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette have floated the notion of trying to convince Saudi Arabia to drop out of OPEC the cartel it helped found in 1965 and instead forming an oil alliance with the U.S. Others have suggested Congress could revive its ""NOPEC"" bill that would allow the U.S. to prosecute the cartel in court under antitrust laws.In the end those measures would have little impact said Randy Bell director of the Atlantic Council's Global Energy Center. ""We're hearing lots of different ideas about what might bring the Saudis to the table but frankly none of them seem realistic"" Bell said. ""It points to the weakness that the U.S. has in this circumstance.""ON THE HILLHOUSE TO PASS RELIEF PACKAGE: The House is expected to pass the ""phase three"" emergency relief package H.R. 748 (116) today. The package omits any mandated emissions reductions for airlines as well as money for the Energy Department to top off the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi predicted on Thursday a ""strong bipartisan vote"" when the House takes up the $2 trillion rescue package though she's also preparing contingency plans.Attention turns to the next relief package: During her weekly press conference Thursday Pelosi began pivoting to the next relief measure and what Democrats would like to see in it POLITICO's Heather Caygle and Melanie Zanona report. ""There's so many things we didn't get in any of these bills yet in the way that we need to"" Pelosi told reporters.Renewable energy groups are expected to push for green energy tax credits in the next package. Particularly some Democrats and environmental groups concerned about climate change have pressed for tax credits for wind and solar industries and as Pro's Anthony Adragna Zack Colman and Gavin Bade reported those clean energy provisions will likely be pushed to a later corporate rescue package.And House Natural Resources Chairman Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) and Rep. Donald McEachin (D-Va.) led a letter with 41 Democrats on Thursday that calls for environmental justice to be included in virus response efforts. ""The effects of COVID-19 are being felt across the country but they are particularly acute in communities with underlying health conditions"" they write. ""We are concerned that environmental justice communities — low-income communities communities of color and Tribal and indigenous communities — across the U.S. and in the U.S. territories are especially vulnerable and live in areas that lack the necessary resources to fully recover from the pandemic."" The letter calls for investments in drinking water services energy efficiency and weatherization programs pollution reduction and workforce development.Still a fourth bill could be some time away. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell adjourned the Senate until April 20.AROUND THE AGENCIESMARK YOUR CALENDARS: The Trump administration will release its final plan to weaken vehicle fuel economy targets on Tuesday an administration official told Pro's Zack Colman. The joint National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and EPA proposal will replace the Obama administration safety and tailpipe emissions standards for vehicles through 2026.The final proposal will call for annual fuel efficiency increases of 1.5 percent across companies' fleets instead of flatlining the targets which was an option in the April 2018 draft proposal according to a person close to the administration. The person also said NHTSA and EPA estimated the proposal would save drivers $1000 on car purchases and that it would save 3000 lives over the rule's lifetime.EPA RELAXES ENFORCEMENT AMID VIRUS: EPA issued a temporary policy Thursday that will allow for industries like oil gas and chemical companies to delay some regulatory compliance amid the coronavirus pandemic Pro's Alex Guillén reports. The policy shift follows requests from industry groups who say workers can't perform all of the tasks required to comply with environmental laws while many of them are social distancing. There are a number of reporting training and monitoring requirements that should be eased to promote social distancing and keep workers from having to gather oil industry executives told POLITICO.The EPA memo issued Thursday is written broadly and avoids making specific enforcement promises but does outline some steps for companies to document how the virus affects compliance. ""We have not provided specific criteria but the memo does state as the lead-in that the reason we're doing it is because we're aware of the travel restrictions the social distancing restrictions and in fact even the stay-at-home restrictions"" EPA enforcement chief Susan Bodine told reporters.Critics like Cynthia Giles the Obama-era enforcement chief now at Harvard's Environmental and Energy Law Program said EPA shouldn't be granting breaks so broadly. ""These rules are there to protect health and they can only be put to one side in the most extreme extraordinary circumstances and even then only when very narrowly tailored to address a specific problem"" she said.EPA is also weighing letting oil refiners sell winter-blend gasoline later in the year to account for reduced demand in the midst of the coronavirus crisis Administrator Andrew Wheeler said Thursday Alex also reports. ""We are looking at the fuels issues on a separate basis and that would be a case-specific issue"" Wheeler told reporters on a conference call adding the agency hopes to have ""some sort of announcement on the fuels"" as soon as today.SPR OF THE MOMENT: The Energy Department has withdrawn its tender for 30 million barrels of oil to put into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve the department said Thursday. The announcement followed the Senate's passage of the coronavirus relief package that did not include the $3 billion DOE had requested to buy oil for the SPR as Ben reports.IG TO PROBE EPA-CALIFORNIA AIR FLAP: EPA's Office of Inspector General will probe the agency's system to review and approve state air cleanup plans following the agency's fight last fall with California. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) requested a probe last year after EPA issued a letter threatening to block highway funding over the state's backlog of pending State Implementation Plans or SIPs that implement Clean Air Act regulations. In January EPA announced California had withdrawn 43 of its 130 pending submissions though the state said it did so because they had been waiting for approval for so long that they had become outdated.The OIG will review factors causing SIP approval delays whether delays in processing submissions affect states' ability to achieve key air quality standards and what EPA is doing to speed up the process Alex reports.FIRED EPA OFFICIAL LANDS NEW TRUMP APPOINTMENT: An EPA official who was fired in February after agency leaders blamed him for excessive travel has landed a new presidential appointment. Trump on Thursday named Mike Stoker as the federal representative to the Western Interstate Energy Board. EPA had dismissed Stoker who ran EPA's Region 9 office covering the Pacific Southwest because he was ""interested in travel for the sake of travel and ignored necessary decision making."" Stoker however alleged he was fired for working too well with Pelosi and other Democrats. The White House declined to discuss Stoker's new appointment.Stoker will be an ex officio representative to the WIEB a position that does not require Senate confirmation. The WIEB which is made up of 11 Western states was created by a 1970 compact to coordinate nuclear power and waste issues and has since expanded its mission to include broader energy concerns in the West.MINERS UNION CALLS FOR EMERGENCY SAFEGUARD: United Mine Workers of America President Cecil Roberts called on the Mine Safety and Health Administration to ""immediately"" issue an emergency standard to protect miners amid the coronavirus crisis. ""While these are certainly difficult times for all workers it is especially challenging for workers who are unable to work from home and have valid concerns about their health and safety and that of their loved ones"" Roberts wrote in a letter this week to Assistant Secretary of Labor for Mine Safety and Health David Zatezalo. Roberts also pointed to underlying health issues that some miners suffer from that would make them especially vulnerable to Covid-19 like black lung disease. ""This makes miners one of the most vulnerable populations for the virus"" he writes.BEYOND THE BELTWAYGAS DEMAND COULD DROP MORE THAN HALF: U.S. gasoline demand could fall by more than 50 percent during the Covid-19 response period according to IHS Markit analysis since fewer drivers will hit the road during social distancing. ""The magnitude of gasoline demand decline will be much greater than the impact of the 2008 recession — and could be further protracted depending on how effective social distancing measures are at controlling the spread of the COVID-19 virus” according to Jim Burkhard vice president of IHS Markit.IHS also forecasts electric vehicle sales will stagnate this year and likely into 2021 due largely in part to a ""faltering"" global auto market. ""EVs also face another headwind with low oil prices making them less competitive in terms of fuel cost savings vis-à-vis their internal combustion engine counterparts"" according to the analysis."

POLITICO's newest division AgencyIQ is providing around-the-clock coverage of the developing public health crisis for regulatory professionals in the biopharmaceutical and in vitro diagnostic communities. AgencyIQ's full suite of research and analysis is available in the COVID-19 Resource Center which addresses important topics ranging from development pathways available to companies bringing new medical products to the public to the impact of FDA's efforts to accelerate the introduction of a vaccine for the novel coronavirus.

It's a stark contrast from just months ago when many clinicians were reluctant to talk politics publicly Ritu Thamman of the University of Pittsburgh's School of Medicine tells us.Thamman is crafting a pandemic-focused class for medical students and using social media to elevate health systems' needs will be a large part of it. ""When you see your colleagues die...and you know medically it could have been prevented that's enough impetus to say 'Enough is enough you're asking me to die without giving me a chance I'm going to speak out.""More clinicians are sharing stories about PPE shortages (see the #GetmePPE hashtag on Twitter) and Thamman said she hopes it'll alert the Trump administration to how desperate front-line caregivers are for adequate protection. They're also using Twitter to counteract misinformation about unproven treatments and highlight potential cardiological side effects of malaria drug hydroxychloroquine which President Donald Trump has talked up as a coronavirus treatment.Thamman said she's also using Twitter to poll other clinicians on new diagnostic tools or to share information about OSHA complaint phone lines with anyone reporting unsafe work environments. Part of the value is connecting with large numbers of providers that wouldn't have met in person knowing ""we're all in this together."" But there's ""also this enormous sense of grief knowing that we're all in this situation"" she said.Not everyone can share their experiences on social media. As Medscape's Alicia Gallegos reported this week some clinicians say their employers are blocking them from speaking out online including by threatening disciplinary action.Sign up for POLITICO Nightly: Coronavirus Special Edition your daily update on how the illness is affecting politics markets public health and more.AZAR PRODS STATES ON LICENSING — Providers who were confused about Vice President Mike Pence's comments on allowing medical professionals to practice across state lines got some clarity when HHS Secretary Alex Azar wrote to the nation's governors this week urging them to revise or waive regulations during the pandemic to allow more people to provide telehealth and other care in underserved areas.Though Pence had referenced upcoming regulation from HHS the letter simply nudged state leaders to use authorities already available to them under state and national emergency declarations. An HHS spokesperson did not clarify whether the department planned to issue any formal regulations. Decisions about medical licensing are generally made at the state level.""The letter makes it clear that HHS is supports states issuing licensing waivers and remaining in control of their licensing policies"" Elliot Vice director of government affairs at the National Council of State Boards of Nursing tells us. Vice told us earlier this month that Pence's announcement caused confusion among providers who weren't sure if state laws were being preempted. ""This gives providers a clear understanding that they must be licensed or have a privilege to practice in the state where they are treating patients.""Azar's letter outlines several requests including streamlining re-certification processes and expanding professionals' ability to practice in other states. Doctors and nurses serving at the front lines ""need backup"" he wrote. ""Your help is needed to ensure health professionals maximize their scopes of practice and are able to travel across state lines or provide telemedicine to communities where they are needed most.""Many states have already taken some of these steps; Texas and other large states allow out-of-state providers to practice as the coronavirus stresses the health care system.Azar’s letter could “bring some kind of consistency” to states’ telehealth approach said Krista Drobac executive director of the telehealth lobbying group the Alliance for Connected Care. Drobac noted that 35 states have waived some licensing requirements for the crisis but with significant variation in what that means for practitioners. “To say it’s confusing is an understatement” she said.The National Governors Association appears to be on board. The group last week urged members to use their own authorities on licensing potentially by activating the Emergency Management Assistance Compact an interstate mutual aid agreement and granting temporary licenses to practice in-person or via telehealth.42 CFR PART 2 OVERHAUL MAKES IT TO PHASE 3 BILL — An overhaul of 42 CFR Part 2 a 1970s-era privacy regulation governing substance use treatment records made it to the third coronavirus relief package in a long-sought victory for many in the health care industry.The regulation had two prongs: the first preventing records from substance use treatment from being used in law enforcement investigations and civil cases; and the second requiring explicit patient consent each time data is shared.The overhaul touches the second prong: patients can give patient consent a single time at which point data is shared within the health care system along HIPAA standards. But patients can revoke their consent if they so choose....That's just one of several health tech provisions in the bill. Some key provisions telehealth lobbyists had pushed for also made it in: One would allow Medicare to pay for virtual visits during the emergency period even if the doctor hadn’t billed the patient before and another would let patients with HSAs and high deductible plans use telehealth before they’d met the deductible. The package would also expand Medicare payments for federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics using telehealth.It also gives FCC $200 million in new funding for telehealth efforts our POLITICO Tech colleague John Hendel reports. That money would “support efforts of health care providers to address coronavirus by providing telecommunications services information services and devices necessary to enable the provision of telehealth services during an emergency period” according to the legislative text released Wednesday.What didn't make it in: A House draft had included a measure to temporarily boost Medicaid funding for programs covering telehealth and another setting aside $330 million for a telephonic and virtual care system that providers and telehealth companies could use for coronavirus response.HITAC SPINS OUT CORONAVIRUS TASK FORCE — ONC's federal advisory committee plans to convene a coronavirus-specific working group in coming weeks ModernHealthcare's Jessica Kim Cohen reports. Co-chairs expect to have specific charges by next week when they'll start seeking participants.VA UNDERTAKES MISSION ACT “PAUSE” — The Department of Veterans Affairs is pausing at least some of its community referrals under the MISSION Act amid the coronavirus crisis the department confirmed Wednesday. The law allows veterans to get care from private-sector sources if certain conditions are fulfilled; but the department says that the pause will affect non-urgent and routine care which is too high a risk under the current pandemic circumstances. The department is attempting to encourage telehealth as an alternative."

Hitcat strikes again.Send your thoughts feedback and especially tips to tstarks@politico.com. Be sure to follow @POLITICOPro and @MorningCybersec. Full team info below.RUSSIATHERE’S MORE TO THIS STORY — Google on Thursday released data showing how the targeting activities of the Russian hacker group Fancy Bear have shifted over the past three years and while some of the findings (such as a constant focus on Ukraine) aren’t surprising others are. For example Fancy Bear aka APT28 which is associated with the Russian military intelligence agency GRU targeted Russian government entities in April and May 2019 — an unusual choice for Moscow’s cyber operatives. “In my work on APT28 targeting in 2015-2017 I saw plenty of domestic Russian targeting” said Reuters’ Raphael Satter “but never of a serving government official.” Other short-term targets included charities in April and May 2019 Syria in March through May 2018 and LGBTQ groups in June 2017.Google shared the Fancy Bear data as part of the latest update from its Threat Analysis Group which included insights on phishing campaigns and the use of zero-day vulnerabilities. Google said it sent 25 percent fewer warnings about state-backed phishing and malware attacks in 2019 compared with 2018 a decline it attributed to improved account security measures. Google also revealed that it saw a threat actor exploiting five zero-day vulnerabilities last year to hack people associated with North Korea policy.NOT PLEASED — The House is set to vote today on the $2 trillion coronavirus package which contains $400 million for election preparations. But the Democratic Association of Secretaries of State says that amount is “not nearly enough” and that $2 billion is needed to pay for vote-by-mail early voting and online registration access.“Once again Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell have stood in the way of these critical election reforms” the Democratic secretaries of state said. “If these policies were in place today the bedrock of American democracy would be much better positioned against cyber threats foreign interference and the current health pandemic.”ESSENTIAL GUIDANCE — The Information Technology Industry Council on Thursday called on governments around the world to adopt uniform guidance on essential workers who need to keep regular schedules during the pandemic to avoid a patchwork of rules that would be more difficult to follow. The group said some states haven’t adopted CISA’s guidance or only partially adopted it and other countries’ rules are problematic or absent.“We urge leaders at every level of government in economies across the globe to adopt similarly clear and comprehensive guidance in their jurisdictions” the group said. “In the United States it is critical that policymakers at the state and local level not only adopt the guidance on essential workers issued by CISA but that state and local officials clearly communicate that guidance to those on the frontlines enforcing shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders.”ANY VOLUNTEERS? — Coronavirus-related cyberattacks are bringing together cyber pros. Reuters reported on a 400-member group going by the name COVID-19 CTI League that features officials from companies such as Microsoft and Amazon and from 40 different countries. Their focus is protecting hospitals and health organizations but it also is working on other related issues. “I’ve never seen this volume of phishing” said Marc Rogers one of the group’s managers. “I am literally seeing phishing messages in every language known to man.”It’s not the only such effort.

171,Government Working on Guidelines to Assess Local Coronavirus Risk Trump Says as He Vows to End Restrictions Quickly,ZEKE MILLER AND ALAN SUDERMAN,TIME,-1,https://time.com/5811144/us-coronavirus-risk-assessment/,(WASHINGTON) — President Donald Trump said Thursday that federal officials are developing guidelines to rate counties by risk of virus spread as he aims to begin to ease nationwide guidelines meant to stem the coronavirus outbreak.In a letter to the nation’s governors Trump said the new guidelines are meant to enable state and local leaders to make “decisions about maintaining increasing or relaxing social distancing and other measures they have put in place.” States and municipalities would still retain authority to set whatever restrictions deem necessary.He has been trying for days to determine how to contain the economic fallout of the guidelines issued by his administration as well as local leaders to slow the tide of infections.“Every day that we stay out it gets harder to bring it back very quickly” Trump said during a Thursday press conference.Last week Trump unveiled a 15-day program advising against large gatherings and calling for many Americans to remain at home. The guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are voluntary but many state and local leaders have issued mandatory restrictions in line with or even tighter than those issued by the CDC.The White House was still developing the new guidelines and gathering the data to back them up Dr. Deborah Birx the White House coordinator for coronavirus response told reporters Thurday.“What we are trying to do is utilize a very laser-focused approach rather than an generic horizontal approach” she said.Birx acknowledged concerns that people could simply move between areas with different infection risks — and potentially different restrictions on movement and gathering amid the outbreak.“Part of this will be the need to have highly responsible behavior between counties” she said saying the administration would provide additional guidance to states next week once the new plan is finalized.Two administration officials said it would not involve any restrictions on travel between hotspots and those with lower rates of infection.Trump announced Thursday that he would visit Norfolk Virginia on Saturday to see off the USNS Comfort the 1000-bed hospital ship heading to assist New York in responding to the virus.On a conference call with governors Thursday Trump stressed the need to reopen businesses and to recognize regional differences in the virus’ impact.“We all have to get smart” Trump said on the call audio of which was obtained by The Associated Press. “We have to open up our country I’m sorry.”Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves who has not ordered business closures or limits on social behavior thanked Trump for recognizing that the virus has affected states differently and “one size does not fit all.”“I appreciate you realizing that” Reeves said.The announcement of the forthcoming new guidelines comes days after Trump said he hoped to “reopen” the country by Easter.“I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter” he said Tuesday during a Fox News virtual town hall. Easter is just over two weeks away — Apr. 12.“Wouldn’t it be great to have all of the churches full?” Trump said in a subsequent interview. “You’ll have packed churches all over our country.”Health experts have made clear that unless Americans continue to dramatically limit social interaction — staying home from work and isolating themselves — the number of infections will overwhelm the health care system as it has in parts of Italy leading to many more deaths.And scientists including Dr. Anthony Fauci the nation’s top infectious disease expert have cautioned against artificial timetables.“And you’ve got to understand that you don’t make the timeline the virus makes the timeline” Fauci told CNN Wednesday. “So you’ve got to respond in what you see happen.”White House counselor Kellyanne Conway said Trump developed the Easter date as a goal to give people “hope.”“I think Easter the president was giving people a lot of hope and basically telling us it won’t last forever and we’ll see what happens over time” she told reporters Thursday.While the worst outbreaks are concentrated in certain parts of the country most significantly in New York experts warn that the highly infectious disease is certain to spread.Trump said the rollout of additional testing will enable more nuanced recommendations that would allow some lesser-impacted parts of the country to regain a sense of normalcy sooner.“Our expanded testing capabilities will quickly enable us to publish criteria developed in close coordination with the Nation’s public health officials and scientists to help classify counties with respect to continued risks posed by the virus” Trump said.Trump appearing to allude to the forthcoming guidelines promised that there would be new favorable “statistics” and “facts” coming from the federal government in the next two days.“Some good statistics are coming out which will make your lives easier” Trump said.

173,U.S. Unemployment Soars by 3.2 Million: How the Coronavirus Jobs Crisis Is Hurting One American City,Justin Worland,TIME,-1,https://time.com/5809596/coronavirus-recession-jobs/,Just a few weeks ago things were looking up for Gabrielle Gregory. The Charlotte NC resident was settling into life with her one-year-old child and saving to buy a house. Her union had just secured a pay raise for her and her fellow food and beverage employees working at Charlotte Douglas International Airport.In a matter of days all of that crumbled. As the nation slowly woke up to the reality of the coronavirus Gregory lost her job as a cook at HMS Host one of more than 800 people laid off by the airport food services company in Charlotte. Her son’s daycare closed. Her partner who also worked at the airport lost his job as well leaving the family to eat into savings. “They laid us off out the blue” she says. “We’re just trying to figure out where our next paycheck is going to come from.”Gregory’s situation mirrors that of the city she lives in. In recent years Charlotte has ranked as one of the most attractive cities for new businesses and over the last decade the region has boasted economic growth that has outpaced the rest of the country. But the coronavirus hit has been sharp. Last week nearly 50000 people filed for unemployment across the state and stories abound from locals being unable to complete online unemployment forms and waiting on hold for hours to talk to someone at the North Carolina Division of Employment Security. “The unemployment claims system is overloaded” says MaryBe McMillan president of the North Carolina AFL-CIO.Charlotte looks much like the country at large. Figures released on March 26 by the Department of Labor show that nearly 3.3 million people across the country filed for unemployment benefits over the previous week far exceeding the 665000 filed at the height of the Great Recession in March 2009. That may be the tip of the iceberg. Unemployment in North Carolina could reach 150000 in the coming weeks as the country stumbles into a recession according to Mike Walden an economist at North Carolina State University. “This is still not as bad as the Great Recession” he says. “But the uncertainty is greater.”And it certainly could be as bad—or worse. Experts say nationwide the unemployment rate could peak as high as 30% in the coming weeks as economic activity declines precipitously across the country.In Charlotte the early suffering has centered largely on the hospitality industry which employs 13% of North Carolina’s workforce. Last week the state ordered restaurants and bars to close for in-person dining. Meanwhile hotel bookings evaporated and flights to the local airport a significant hub for American Airlines were cancelled delivering a big hit to the city’s $7-billion tourism sector.“This has been the hardest week of my professional career” says Lynn Minges CEO of the North Carolina Restaurant & Lodging Association. “We’ve known about coronavirus for quite some time but I don’t think any of expected the tsunami that has come upon us.”The challenges have led to a flurry of innovative efforts to keep cash flowing. Restaurants have scrambled to offer innovative take-out offerings using social media and email blasts to customers to ask them for their support. At the Dilworth Grille just outside Charlotte’s city center a sign was posted in all caps telling passersby to “support local” and “order takeout.” The list of upcoming live music events on the Facebook page of Music Everywhere an initiative to support the city’s local music industry has been replaced by a list of local livestreams that accept donations and optional contributions. “A lot of people are innovating right now in our backyard” says Tariq Bokhari a member of Charlotte’s city council.Many in the city have looked to some of the big corporations headquartered in the region for support. A long list of Charlotte-headquartered companies—including Lowe’s Bank of America and Lending Tree—donated $1 million each to meet the needs of people hurt by coronavirus.Even some of the biggest companies in the region face tough times. Charlotte-based Honeywell for instance told employees that they would be required to take two weeks of unpaid leave amid mounting financial challenges. The company also cut pay for executives. Nearly two thirds of business leaders surveyed by the Charlotte Regional Business Alliance said they were concerned about the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on sales and more than 20% said their business could not last more than a month with no new sales. “The biggest takeaway right now is the uncertainty regardless of how big you are how small you are what industry you’re in” says Janet LaBar CEO of the Alliance. “We’re going to see businesses downsizing.”All of this is of little comfort to local workers who are just trying to put food on the table. And while the state government has loosened rules on who qualifies for unemployment North Carolina ranks among the least unionized states in the U.S. and has been criticized for poor worker protection laws. “What this crisis has done is expose the real holes in our safety net” says McMillan.Gregory like Charlotte’s business leaders says one of the biggest challenges is uncertainty. The food service worker says her company’s communications about the layoffs were unclear and she doesn’t know if she might be able to return to her job if things pick back up. Whether looking to her employer or to government officials Gregory says she just wants more information so she can plan.“There needs to be more things in place going forward like how we really gonna attack this issue?” she says. “At this time I don’t know if it’s short term or long term.”All of this is of little comfort to local workers who are just trying to put food on the table.

174,Trump Administration Urged to Free Migrants From Detention as Virus Surges, BEN FOX PHILIP MARCELO AND NOMAAN MERCHANT / AP,TIME,-1,https://time.com/5810346/trump-immigration-detention-coronavirus-covid-19/,(WASHINGTON) — Pressure was mounting on the Trump administration Wednesday to release people from immigration detention facilities where at least one detainee has tested positive for COVID-19 and advocates fear tight quarters and overall conditions could cause rapid spread of the virus.The U.S. holds around 37000 people in immigration detention. Detainees and advocates say many are vulnerable because of age and pre-existing medical conditions and because they are often held in open rooms beds 3-feet apart and without adequate supplies of masks or other protections.“It’s impossible to stay calm” said Marco Battistotti an Italian who is among 170 people detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the Bristol County jail in Massachusetts. “People are panicking. People are in fear.”The 54-year-old Battistotti was among about 100 detainees at the county jail near Cape Cod who signed a letter released by a local immigration lawyer detailing conditions inside. They asked to be released to await decisions on their immigration cases.“I don’t want to die in an ICE jail” he said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. “Why can’t I fight my case on the outside?”The agency which reported the positive test of a 31-year-old man from Mexico held in Bergen County New Jersey on Tuesday has announced steps to protect detained migrants and staff from the virus but hasn’t said whether it plans to review cases for possible release because of the outbreak. It did not immediately respond to a request to comment on the complaints about conditions from the detainees and their advocates.The administration has tried to balance its overall hard line on immigration a signature policy of President Donald Trump and its response to the outbreak with ICE announcing previously that it would “temporarily adjust” operations to focus on apprehending people who pose a risk to public safety or are subject to mandatory detention because of a criminal record.Immigrant advocates including the American Civil Liberties Union filed lawsuits in California Maryland Pennsylvania and elsewhere seeking court orders for the immediate release of people in immigration detention especially those at risk because of their age or medical conditions.Advocates have also asked a court in Los Angeles to order the Office of Refugee Resettlement to release to eligible sponsors around 1200 migrant children who were apprehended without parents or legal guardians and have been held in government-contracted shelters for more than 30 days. They said two staff members at two such facilities in New York have tested positive for COVID-19.It’s unclear how many immigration detainees overall are at higher risk but one California suit alone had 13 plaintiffs all over 55.A federal judge in Boston on Wednesday ordered the release of a 36-year-old man from the Dominican Republic who was detained in a local jail south of the city where an employee tested positive. The ACLU sued for the release of two others held there.A panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Monday citing the “rapidly escalating public health crisis” ordered the immediate release of a 37-year-old woman who is fighting deportation to Mexico.The woman’s lawyer Max Carter-Oberstone said the government told him it would not oppose the decision but she still had not been released as of early Wednesday. The court took the action on its own initiative in a rare move on behalf of a woman who says she has been threatened with death by members of a Mexican drug cartel.“It wasn’t something we asked for or were expecting” Carter-Oberstone said. “The court is clearly reacting to the greater public health crisis that we’re in right now and re-evaluating how it’s going to dispose of its immigration cases in light of that crisis that we’re all experiencing.”The situation in immigration detention which include facilities run by local jurisdictions and private contractors is similar to that facing jails and prisons with staff also at risk from a virus that already has sickened at least 55000 people and killed about 800 in the U.S.One difference is that more than half of ICE detainees have no criminal charges or conviction and are held only for immigration reasons. Under previous administrations many would likely have been released on bond as they pursued their cases.ICE has reported one positive test of an employee at a detention facility in Elizabeth New Jersey and 18 confirmed cases among staff not involved in detaining migrants. A contractor reported a positive case of a staff member at a facility in Harris County Texas. The agency says it is screening new detainees and isolating detainees who show symptoms of the coronavirus disease.Detainees say those measures won’t do much with people staying in dorm-like bays with no social distancing possible or in smaller rooms that they sometimes have to clean themselves with insufficient cleaning supplies.Francisca Morales Diaz a 45-year-old from Mexico who was released Friday from an ICE detention center in Louisiana said she and others were issued soap and toilet paper for their own use once a week and they would run out. When they complained she says they were told there were shortages on the outside as well.“There isn’t enough medicine. It’s not well-maintained” Morales told AP. Her fear is that “at any moment they’re going to come and take me back there.”Pepper spray was used Tuesday by guards inside the Pine Prairie jail in Louisiana against migrants who say they were demanding the facility do more to protect them from the virus according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. ICE spokesman Bryan Cox said seven people were sprayed after they refused to follow guards’ directives.Ira Alkalay a lawyer representing some of the detainees at the jail near Cape Cod said the detainees are responsible for cleaning their unit which includes a dining area and bathrooms but aren’t even given bleach. Some who signed the letter suffer from respiratory ailments such as tuberculosis emphysema and asthma that put them at higher risk to the virus.“These are not sanitary conditions at all” Alkalay said. “If the virus is introduced many people could get sick all at once. Hospitals in the area can become quickly overwhelmed.”The office of Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson who has made headlines for offering to send the jail’s ICE detainees to help build Trump’s promised border wall has stressed there are currently no confirmed or suspected cases of the virus at the facility.“We suspect these detainees are working with outside political activist groups to use the coronavirus crisis to advance their political agenda” the sheriff’s spokesman Jonathan Darling said this week.Eunice Cho an ACLU lawyer warned that if the virus spreads through a facility the number of sick people who would require advanced care could overwhelm nearby hospitals. Many ICE jails are in rural areas with smaller hospitals.“This is closely related to the public health of our entire community” Cho said.________________________________Marcelo reported from Boston.

175,The Senate Just Passed a $2 Trillion Coronavirus Stimulus Package. Here’s What's in It,ALANA ABRAMSON AND PHILIP ELLIOTT,TIME,-1,https://time.com/5810315/congress-coronavirus-bailout/,After days of intense and dramatic negotiations the Senate passed a landmark $2 trillion relief package for millions of Americans and businesses hurt by the coronavirus pandemic.The bill includes direct $1200 cash payments to many Americans; $150 billion to help the healthcare industry; $500 billion for state and local governments and companies; and $350 billion in loans and assistance for small businesses.The measure passed unanimously although only 96 Senators were present because four were in quarantine after exposure to the coronavirus. The measure must now pass the House of Representatives before heading to President Donald Trump’s desk. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said there will be a voice vote on Friday morning which does not require in-person participation. While passage is not guaranteed Senators on both sides of the aisle expressed confidence they had reached a deal that would pass the Democrat-majority House.“Over the past few days the Senate has stepped into the breach. We packed weeks or perhaps months of the legislative process into five days. Representatives from both sides of the aisle and both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue have forged a bipartisan agreement in highly partisan times with very little time to spare” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the floor in remarks preceding the vote. “It’s been a long hard road with a remarkable number of twists and turns but for the sake of millions of Americans it will be worth it.”Congressional staffers spent all day writing the 880-page bill after a deal was announced early Wednesday morning and the text of the final agreement was not officially circulated to Senate offices until less than an hour before the vote. In a sign of the precarious nature of the situation McConnell’s office circulated one version of what was deemed the final text Wednesday evening only to circulate an updated copy several hours later.Here are six key provisions hashed out over long days on Capitol Hill:Direct payments to AmericansAmerican taxpayers earning up to $75000 will receive $1200 and couples earning up to $150000 will receive $2400. Beyond those amounts payments will decrease for individuals earning up to $99000 and couples earning $198000. Every child in single- and two-parent households earning less than $198000 will also receive a $500 payment. The payments will be based on 2019 tax returns – or 2018 if those were the last returns filed. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said the payments will be in the form of direct deposit and if the House approves the bill and Trump signs it will be sent within three weeks.Expanded unemployment insuranceThe government will provide people who are unemployed with a $600 weekly stipend for up to four months on top of benefits already provided by states. These payments will go to people who have been laid off or furloughed and to out-of-work members of the gig economy. The bill almost hit a snag Wednesday when a group of Republican Senators — Nebraska’s Ben Sasse South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott and Florida’s Rick Scott — voiced opposition to this provision believing it would encourage laid off workers to stay on the unemployment rolls. The Senate ultimately voted on an amendment to fix the provision but it failed largely along party lines.$150 billion for health careThe deal allots $150 billion for the health care system and hospitals which have been sounding the alarm that they will soon exceed capacity and are already running low on critical supplies; $100 billion will go directly to hospitals and the additional funds will go toward supplies medical research and workforce increases. Some $16 billion is specifically allotted for hospitals to procure supplies like personal protective equipment and ventilators.Loans to small businessesLawmakers say they are allocating at least $360 billion to help small businesses and nonprofits. Much of that will go to businesses to pay workers mortgage interest and rent. Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey said businesses of up to 500 employees are eligible for this assistance.Loans to state governments and industriesThe Treasury Department will create a fund worth $500 billion or more to assist local and state governments and industries hit by the pandemic. The Treasury will also make $46 billion in direct financial assistance including $25 billion to airlines $17 billion for national security and $4 billion for cargo.Oversight of corporate use of fundsDemocrats fought for stringent oversight of the Treasury fund arguing that Trump Vice President Mike Pence and Mnuchin could personally benefit from the funds without anyone knowing. The GOP agreed to appoint an inspector general to oversee the fund and any businesses controlled by Trump Pence Mnuchin or heads of executive departments or their spouses in-laws or offspring are barred from receiving loans.
176,Trump Wants to Reopen America 'By Easter.' But That's (Mostly) Up to the States Not the President,Tara Law,TIME,-1,https://time.com/5809962/trump-coronavirus-easter/,Barely weeks into a nationwide social distancing effort to slow the spread of the deadly coronavirus politicians pundits and health experts are at odds over how long the isolation should last. Some are concerned about the economic toll of the shutdown — global markets have sputtered and the U.S. unemployment rate could climb into unprecedented territory. But many say that we’ve only just begun the fight against this novel and deadly virus and relaxing our stance now could cost an untold number of lives.President Donald Trump appears eager to get the economy moving again. On Tuesday the President said he wants to see the American economy “opened up and raring to go by Easter.” That’s on April 12 a little over two weeks away and an earlier date than even his own health experts recommend. (“I think it’s going to be several weeks” Dr. Anthony Fauci the country’s top infectious disease expert said Friday.) Even with the current rules in place nearly 1000 people have already died of complications related to COVID-19 in the U.S.; that number stands to rise dramatically.But even if Trump begins encouraging Americans to get back to work it will be largely up to state and local leaders — especially governors — to chart their own courses. Governor Gavin Newsom of California has said his state’s social distancing measures could last two to three months while New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has said they could last as long as nine months in his state home to the country’s worst outbreak yet.“This is not a short-term situation. This is not a long weekend. This is not a week” Cuomo said Sunday. “The timeline nobody can tell you. It depends on how we handle it.”Keep up to date with our daily coronavirus newsletter by clicking here.Why do Cuomo Newsom and the other 48 governors have such authority? Under the U.S. Constitution states have “an inherent power to take actions to protect the health and wellbeing” of their residents says Wendy E. Parmet director of the Center for Health Policy and Law at Northeastern University.In a public health emergency the federal government’s role is to share information with states manage resources and assist in other ways experts say. And while the federal government could step in if it decides a state isn’t doing enough during such a crisis it has limited power to intervene if it feels like a state is doing too much.“In general there’s very little [federal] authority to reduce measures that are taken by state and local governments” says Polly Price professor of law and global health at Emory University. “State and local governments’ primary obligation their primary responsibility is the health of their populations. The basic concept underlying federal law that’s related to epidemics disasters emergencies — everything there the concept is to assist states when they’re dealing with the health of their populations.”However Trump has ways to coerce states into compliance should he want to restart the American economy despite resistance. He could for instance use “the power of the purse” denying states federal funding or other help if they don’t comply with his wishes.Trump could also reactivate the federal workforce getting at least some of the economy moving again without the governors’ help.Yet Trump’s most powerful tool to get states to go his way may be his megaphone. Some state leaders like Texas Lt. Governor Dan Patrick — who suggested that elderly Americans are willing to die for the economy — also want to roll back stay-at-home restrictions despite recommendations from health experts. The President’s words could give those leaders political cover to do just that says Jon Michaels a professor at UCLA School of Law. And if some states relax their isolation policies early it could put pressure on others to do the same especially as some out-of-work citizens clamor to get their paychecks again.But Michaels adds that if Trump decides to push more actively for an economic restart it could backfire leading to a deeper public health crisis that causes states to clamp down even further than they already have.And from a public health point of view mixed messaging from the federal government and state or local politicians can take a toll of its own leading people to ignore social distancing guidelines altogether.“In many ways it’s the honor system” says Price. “The government does not have the resources to go track down people and sit outside people’s houses who are already under a quarantine or isolation order and make sure they don’t leave. But in terms of how people react if you don’t trust the government authorities and what they are telling you getting cooperation from the public or controlling fear in the public gets more and more difficult.”
177,U.S. Justice Department Argues Transgender Athletes Should Not Be Treated as Girls,PAT EATON-ROBB / AP,TIME,-1,https://time.com/5809801/justice-department-transgender-athletes/,(HARTFORD Conn.) — The U.S. Justice Department is getting involved in a federal civil rights lawsuit that seeks to block transgender athletes in Connecticut from competing as girls in interscholastic sports.Attorney General William Barr signed what is known as a statement of interest Tuesday arguing against the policy of the Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference the board that oversees the state’s high school athletic competitions.The conference allows athletes to compete as the gender with which they identify arguing it is following a state law that requires high school students be treated according to their gender identity. It also argues the policy is in accordance with Title IX the federal law that allows girls equal educational opportunities including in athletics.The Justice Department in its filing disagrees.“Under CIAC’s interpretation of Title IX however schools may not account for the real physiological differences between men and women. Instead schools must have certain biological males — namely those who publicly identify as female — compete against biological females” Barr and the other department officials write. “In so doing CIAC deprives those women of the single-sex athletic competitions that are one of the marquee accomplishments of Title IX.”The lawsuit was filed in February by runners Selina Soule a senior at Glastonbury High School; Chelsea Mitchell a senior at Canton High School; and Alanna Smith a sophomore at Danbury High School against the conference and several local boards of education.They argue they have been deprived of wins state titles and athletic opportunities by being forced to compete against transgender athletes.“Males will always have inherent physical advantages over comparably talented and trained girls — that’s the reason we have girls sports in the first place” their attorney Christiana Holcomb said Wednesday. “And a male’s belief about his gender doesn’t eliminate those advantages.”Messages seeking comment were left Wednesday with the attorneys representing the the athletic conference other defendants and the American Civil Liberties Union which represents the two transgender girls who run track in Connecticut.The spring track season is on hold because of the COVID-19 pandemic but conference officials have put off a decision on whether to cancel it.Holcomb has said because the lawsuit also asks for changes to the state record book the lawsuit will go forward even if it is not resolved before the seniors graduate.
178,Trump Bets on Powers of Persuasion to Compel Big Business to Produce Urgent Medical Supplies,W.J. Hennigan,TIME,-1,https://time.com/5809264/trump-big-business-coronavirus/,As coronavirus outbreaks ripple across the United States President Donald Trump faces mounting pressure to use emergency powers to compel American manufacturing firms to produce much-needed medical equipment. Dwindling supplies of respirator masks gowns gloves and other basic protective equipment are pushing the nation’s front-line medical workers toward a breaking point. The nation’s stock of life-saving mechanical ventilators used to help critical COVID-19 patients breathe is dangerously low experts warn.A growing chorus of politicians medical professionals and hospital officials are pleading with the president to ease the deepening crisis by using his authorities under the Defense Production Act (DPA) to mobilize U.S. private production capacity to manufacture the supplies. Trump did initially invoke the act a week ago but he has yet to harness the act’s powers to its fullest extent: nationalizing production lines to crank out mechanical ventilators and other medical equipment. “The Defense Production Act is in full force but haven’t had to use it because no one has said NO! Millions of masks coming as back up to States” he said Tuesday in a Twitter post.Instead Trump’s strategy is to persuade the private sector to do more. It’s part of the job that he has come to enjoy playing businessman for the American people. He has involved big name corporations in his Administration’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic from the start bringing in executives to assist in the effort which has thus far achieved limited results. But the president’s unyielding drive to play dealmaker even in the case of a pandemic could be the deciding factor in whether states can get supplies into the hands of its medical professionals according to governors mayors lawmakers doctors and nurses.Even the best hospitals could run out of personal protective equipment and ventilators. In anticipation of the looming disaster governors from the hardest-hit states say they’re locked into counter-productive bidding wars with one another to acquire the supplies from distributors. The CDC has advised doctors and nurses to use household items like scarves and bandanas as protective measures if necessary. And a grassroots mobilization is underway inside small T-shirt factories kitchens basements and garages across the country to produce makeshift protective gear for medical professionals.Time is running out. The American Hospital Association American Medical Association and American Nurses Association jointly wrote a letter to Trump that described the pressing need for supplies. “America’s hospitals health systems physicians and nurses urge you to immediately use the DPA to increase the domestic production of medical supplies and equipment that hospitals health systems physicians nurses and all frontline providers so desperately need” it said.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has requested 30000 ventilators in anticipation of the coming crush of severely ill patients in emergency rooms. The state is now the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S. with more than 25000 cases—and the rate of new infections is doubling every three days Cuomo told reporters Tuesday. Asking businesses to for voluntary commitments is too risky of a strategy he said especially if human lives are at stake. “Volunteerism is nice. It is a beautiful thing” he said. “That is not going to get us there and I do not for the life of me understand the reluctance to use the federal Defense Production Act.”“Only the federal government has that power and not to exercise that power is inexplicable to me” Cuomo said.Without Washington at the controls the free market is working against the states Cuomo said: “Masks that we paid 85 cents for we’re now paying $7.” He’s not alone. The same criticism has been levied by Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker who say suppliers are taking advantage of states as they vie for the same equipment.Mike Schiller senior director of supply chain for the Association for Health Care Resource & Materials Management says a big factor in the shortage is that many of materials come from China which saw its production capacity ravaged when COVID-19 first broke out there in December. “It’s also important to remember that there is a global demand for these supplies. It’s not just a U.S. need” he says. “The Defense Production Act has been authorized but I don’t know that we’re taking full advantage of it.”Initially signed into law by President Harry Truman in 1950 in response to the Korean War the DPA is historically based on the War Powers Acts of World War II. Its sweeping authorities allow the president to demand businesses and corporations to prioritize and accept government contracts for materials during natural disasters terrorist attacks and other national emergencies. The president can incentivize the U.S. industrial base to produce the needed goods through loans and high-dollar contracts. During World War II cities like Detroit became known as the “Arsenal of Democracy” after automakers transformed their manufacturing plants to assemble warplanes tanks and other heavy equipment.While the DPA is primarily associated with nationalizing parts of the economy for national defense it has been invoked for a range of emergencies in recent years including restoring power and distributing food and water in Puerto Rico in 2017 after Hurricane Maria. Presidents have felt most comfortable using the DPA in that limited role says Jerry McGinn who oversaw DPA programs in the Pentagon’s Office of Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy. “The provision to control the distribution of materials in specific industries has always been controversial and rarely invoked” he says. “Having the government nationalize an industry won’t necessarily solve the problem.”Perhaps unsurprisingly the business community has not warmed to the idea of being forced to manufacture products and prioritize government contracts. After Trump invoked the Act the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in a statement that the DPA “isn’t a magic wand to immediately solving medical supply shortages” and won’t result in producing “highly specialized manufacturing equipment overnight.”Trump a career businessman who often preaches about the perils of socialism is receptive to that argument. Invoking the DPA he admitted Sunday sent “tremors through” the corporate community. “We’re a country not based on nationalizing our business” Trump said. “Call a person over in Venezuela ask them how did nationalization of their businesses work out. Not too well. The concept of nationalizing our business is not a good concept.”Trump is convinced that the best way to meet demand for equipment is by cajoling automakers medical device manufacturers and other industrial firms for voluntary commitments. In some cases it’s worked remarkably well. After Vice President Mike Pence made a high profile visit to 3M a manufacturer of respirator masks the firm said it will nearly double production to an annual rate of 2 billion masks worldwide. Honeywell also committed to boosting its capacity to make masks. Pence said Tuesday that tech giant Apple was planning to donate 9 million of its masks.However attempts to broaden that effort are less conclusive—at least in the near-term—as the number of cases across the country climbs. General Motors “is exploring the feasibility to build ventilators” at an Indiana facility by partnering with Ventec Life Systems. Ford said it would “lend its manufacturing and engineering expertise” by joining forces with companies like 3M and GE Healthcare to produce medical supplies such as face-shields and respirator masks. Hanes will also begin making FDA-approved face masks but not the medical grade N-95 masks that are most in-demand.Nevertheless the White House believes its strategy will meet hospitals’ fast-growing demand. “We’re getting what we need without putting the heavy hand of government down” White House adviser Peter Navarro told reporters Sunday claiming the Administration’s actions have resulted in “the greatest mobilization in the industrial base since World War II.”He provided two examples in how the Administration’s strategy of private-sector volunteerism compares the most notable civilian-military partnership in American history: French company Pernod Ricard which has retooled its American facilities from producing alcoholic beverages to hand sanitizers and Honeywell which has promised to open another mask-making production line within 30 days.Navarro who counsels Trump on trade matters has a staff of 10 on the first floor of the Executive Office Building across an alley from the West Wing of the White House. He is now spearheading—along with Larry Kudlow the director of National Economic Council and Rear Adm. John Polowczyk who recently came over from the Pentagon where he led military logistics for the Joint Chiefs of Staff—the effort to persuade businesses into joining the pandemic response. The team is now trying to figure out how best to help the medical manufacturing industry which is globally connected and complex. They are also coming to find that it’s difficult to track the constellations of suppliers and distributors widely disbursed around the world.They are running short on time to catch up. “Nobody has one sight picture for that supply chain” Polowczyk told reporters Monday. “We have a team of people that are searching the globe for personal protective equipment figuring out where it is figuring out if we need to buy it or just transport it and get it here faster.”—With reporting by Brian Bennett/Washington
179,President Trump's Dangerous and Foolish Impatience on Coronavirus,DAVID FRENCH,TIME,-1,https://time.com/5809260/president-trumps-dangerous-impatience-coronavirus/,As the United States enters the second week of the White House’s 15-day effort to “slow the spread” two things are becoming clear at once. First the spread of Covid-19 is not slowing. It’s accelerating with New York state so hard hit that it’s suffered more cases than most European nations. Second Donald Trump is growing increasingly impatient with the state lockdowns. He has now repeatedly tweeted (with caps-lock emphasis) that the “cure cannot be worse” than the disease and emphasized that people “want to return to work.”Indeed last night on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News shot Texas lieutenant governor Dan Patrick ghoulishly suggested that he and other seniors should be willing “take a chance” on their own survival to prevent economic collapse.This is deeply troubling. Before I explain why let me dispense with a strawman. There is no serious desire to extend state lockdowns into an indefinite future. Governors don’t want to see their state economies struggle one moment longer than is necessary. But it is necessary for the moment. At the same time when Trump signals impatience mere days into what could well be an extended crisis he’s signaling that he doesn’t fully understand the dimensions of the challenge America faces.But it’s even worse. His tweeted declarations indicate that he doesn’t even understand the limits of his own power. He’s hinting at economic relief that he cannot give.Writing in response to rising impatience former Trump FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb had perhaps the best and most succinct response. “There is no such thing as a functioning economy” he said “so long as Covid-19 continues to spread uncontrolled in our biggest cities.” Lift the lid on the economy too soon and all you do is increase the spread of the disease without restoring economic health.Why? Again Gottlieb’s words ring true: “[O]lder people will die in historic numbers middle aged folks doomed to prolonged ICU stays to fight for their lives hospitals will be overwhelmed and most Americans terrified to leave homes eat out take the subway or go to the park.”Let’s make this practical and personal. So long as the virus continues to spread will you go back to airports? Will you eat at restaurants? Will you ask your employer to keep working from home if work from home is at all possible? Some of you may answer with an enthusiastic yes. But many millions of Americans would answer no and the number that would say no would increase as they watched more and more people become seriously ill. And as friends and loved ones get sick with a disease that often strikes much harder than the flu.Let’s not forget that the American economy is inextricably linked to the world economy and most of the richest economies in the world are now facing their own deep challenges from Covid-19. Even if America decided all on its own to lift most of its restrictions and endure a vastly increased viral spread and death rate it would still not enjoy the benefits of “normal” economic times.Compounding the problem Trump’s statements betray a fundamental ignorance about our nation’s federalist system. Simply put the power to issue stay-in-place orders ban large gatherings and order business closings rests with state and local authorities not with the president.A quick constitutional primer is in order. The federal government is a government of enumerated powers meaning that it has only the powers that the Constitution gives it. State governments by contrast possess a general police power. That means they have a degree of inherent sovereign authority that the federal government does not. As the Supreme Court outlined all the way back in 1824 state governments possess the power to enact “quarantine laws” and “health laws of every description.”To put it simply Donald Trump cannot order New York’s businesses to close. Andrew Cuomo can. Conversely Trump cannot order New York’s businesses to open. Only the New York state government possesses that power.But that doesn’t mean that Trump’s impatience can’t create serious problems. He has considerable resources at his disposal and considerable sway over GOP politicians and Republican voters. If a governor defies a Trump “order” or “guidance” to re-open he or she may quickly face a political crisis even in the midst of the pandemic.Americans do need hope that this crisis will end. They do need to see the endgame and perceive a specific strategy (based on the best advice from experts and other countries). Politicians should not use words like “indefinite” to describe lockdowns and they need to communicate clearly that buy-in now can shorten the period of worst economic pain.American leaders have compared our fight against Covid-19 to war and the analogy is apt. In war demands for extreme sacrifice are ideally paired with a strategy for victory and the hope for measurable progress. What are the measurements that should give Americans hope for relief? Communicate them clearly. Create a sense of social solidarity and shared cooperation to reach those metrics. Only then can we ensure that the light at the end of the tunnel isn’t the headlamp of an oncoming train.
180,I’m Mentally and Physically Exhausted.’ Healthcare Workers Battling Coronavirus Are Running Out of Protective Gear,Abby Vesoulis,TIME,-1,https://time.com/5808992/healthcare-workers-lack-ppe/,At the Southeast Florida emergency room where 62-year-old nurse Penny Blake works hospital administrators put gloves cleaning supplies and N-95 masks behind lock and key because people were stealing them.Twelve hundred miles away at Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York City N-95 masks which are only supposed to be worn for up to eight hours are so scarce that doctors are keeping them in their lockers. “Once you get one the feeling is you keep it for as long as you can” said Dr. Michelle Lin.In more than a dozen interviews with TIME medical professionals from California to New York painted a picture of scarce resources growing anxieties and frustrations with hospital administrators and the government for failing to adequately prepare. Chief among their concerns was the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) including masks gowns and eye gear. With more than 43000 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States so far a lack of this gear means they face a high risk of exposure to the virus—which in turn means accidentally exposing other patients their own families and their colleagues at a time when hospitals cannot afford to have critical personnel on the sidelines.“The biggest concern we have is that we will not have enough personal protective equipment to take care of the number of patients that are coming in” says Blake. “And if we can’t protect ourselves then we’re not going to be able to be there for them.”Dr. Matthew Baldwin a critical care physician and pulmonary specialist at New York Presbyterian-Columbia Hospital says he expects the problem to get worse from here. “We’ve had an exponential increase in the number of patients that have come into hospital and have been hospitalized in the last 48 hours” he told TIME on March 21. “I think there’s genuine concern now that in the near future we will run out of personal protective equipment.”In recent weeks governors mayors and public health officials have begged President Donald Trump to address shortages in medical equipment but they’ve received conflicting messages. On March 18 Trump signed an executive order invoking the Defense Production Act a 70-year-old law that authorizes presidents to compel American companies to prioritize federal government orders to produce equipment necessary to protect national security over other orders. By March 24 FEMA administrator Peter Gaynor told CNN the law would be used to procure 60000 more masks. But around the same time that day the President tweeted he and his team “haven’t had to use it.”Trump has suggested there was no need for mandatory marching orders because companies like Fiat Chrysler Automobiles were already ramping up production of PPE on their own. Trump also said on March 22 that invoking the act would be tantamount to socialism. “The concept of nationalizing our business is not a good concept” he told reporters.The Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that if the coronavirus outbreak lasts a year healthcare providers and patients will require 3.5 billion N-95 masks which are also called respirators. The U.S. currently has roughly 12 million respirators in its national stockpile.Blake expresses disappointment in the government in part for failing to adequately prepare for the crisis. “It is part of the federal government’s responsibility to ensure that there are resources out there for protection of their citizens” she says. “I find it hard to believe that no one foresaw that this could have been a potential need in this day and time.”In the absence of a coherent national supply chain states and health care facilities across the country are scrambling to ration what PPE they have. Administrators at hospitals in Seattle and Washington DC have asked doctors and patients to reuse masks for prolonged periods while staff at one Chicago hospital have started using washable lab goggles instead of disposable face shields according to the Washington Post. An article in the American Journal of Infection Control recommends N-95 respirators be put on only five times before they lose their full effectiveness.“Basically I’ve been told to wear that same N-95 respirator mask for 24 hours” an emergency physician working in a Tennessee hospital told TIME. “And if it doesn’t get contaminated I was supposed to reuse it the next day.” At Mt. Sinai Hospital in New York City some providers have also begun “reusing masks after shifts” Lin said. Some have even gone as far as “spraying Lysol on the mask to reuse” it she adds.The Tennessee hospital has also moved some of its protective garb like gowns and face shields to more secure areas. While the measure is reducing theft it’s also making it harder for healthcare workers to access the supplies when they need them. Recently when the trauma physician was treating a critically ill trauma patient with a high risk of blood contamination she didn’t have time to grab the tools necessary to keep her and her patient safe. “We did not have masks with face shields immediately available” she says. “That was scary.”The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested on March 17 that health care providers “might use homemade masks (e.g. bandana scarf) for care of patients with COVID-19 as a last resort.”Administrators at both Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York and the Providence St. Joseph hospital chain based in Washington state predicted in mid-March that at least some of their facilities were down to a few days worth of critical PPE supplies.In Los Angeles County where there are at least 536 confirmed patients and seven deaths a nurse who treats a vulnerable population at a large hospital told TIME she’s been instructed to limit how much PPE she uses and in some cases acquire her own. “We have been encouraged to go to Home Depot and buy our own eyewear” she says. She’s also been asked to give blood as her hospital grapples with a short supply due to fewer blood drive donations in the surrounding areas. “The Red Cross doesn’t have a normal flow of blood donors coming in” she says. “Our job is blood sweat and tears.”In Pittsburg a labor and delivery nurse tells TIME she is only permitted to wear surgical masks during cesarean sections despite frequent visits from other staff and unscreened patients who come from at-risk floors. Providers in her department are not given access to the N-95 masks which provide the best protection against airborne illnesses. “I’m mentally and physically exhausted” the nurse says. “I’m here to help the community but at the same time I’m probably exposing them.”According to staff guidance published by the Mt. Sinai Hospital System last week asymptomatic employees “regardless of exposure to a known case of COVID-19” would not be tested for the disease. It would also not test employees with mild symptoms “who do not require hospitalization.” In a statement to TIME Dr. David L. Reich the system’s president and chief operating officer defended the protocol saying that Mt. Sinai is following state and city guidelines. “As priorities shift in the coming weeks Mount Sinai has the capacity to perform additional testing and we will do so as directed from our city and state officials” he said.The Tennessee doctor who asked not to be named to avoid retribution by her employer explained she’s nearing a breaking point. “It’s pretty overwhelming. This is the most anxious I’ve ever felt in my entire life” she said through tears adding “This is the most stressed out I’ve ever been.”In Italy where COVID-19 has claimed the lives of more than 6000 people according to a Johns Hopkins University tracker doctors are facing so many serious cases that many are forced to decide which patients are given ventilators a life-saving breathing machine. There are nowhere near enough ventilators available in either Italy or the U.S. “What I’d like to tell my American colleagues” Roberto Tonelli a 31-year-old pulmonologist in Modena Italy told TIME “is be prepared for the amount of deaths you will see.”Back in Florida Blake is watching Italy closely. “Right now those of us in healthcare we all have pre-traumatic stress disorder because we know what’s coming and we know it’s going to be a storm” she tells me. She knows that being in her sixties puts her at an increased risk of serious COVID-19 symptoms she says but she has no plans to step off the frontlines.“That’s my job. I went into nursing because I wanted to help people” she says. “I just feel like I’ve got to get in there and use my personal protective equipment.”For her sake and for that of her patients hopefully she has enough of it.-With reporting by Francesca Trianni/Orlando and Haley Sweetland Edwards/New York
181,As Trump signals readiness to break with experts his online base assails Fauci,Isaac Stanley-Becker ,The Washington Post,-1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-trump-signals-readiness-to-break-with-experts-his-online-base-assails-fauci/2020/03/26/3802de14-6df6-11ea-aa80-c2470c6b2034_story.html,A cadre of right-wing news sites pulled from the fringes in recent years through repeated mention by President Trump is now taking aim at Anthony S. Fauci the ­nation’s top infectious diseases ­expert who has given interviews in which he has tempered praise for the president with doubts about his pronouncements.Although both men are seeking to tamp down the appearance of tension — “Great job” Trump commended the doctor during the White House’s briefing on Tuesday — the president is increasingly chafing against medical consensus. He has found support from a chorus of conservative commentators who have cheered his promise to get the U.S. economy going again as well as his decision to tout possible coronavirus treatments not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.“The president was right and frankly Fauci was wrong” Lou Dobbs said Monday on his show on the Fox Business Network referring to the use of experimental medicine.Beyond prime-time television however the disregard for expert guidance being pushed by some conservative and libertarian voices goes further — aimed not simply at proving Fauci wrong but at painting him as an agent of the “deep state” that Trump has vowed to dismantle. The smear campaign taking root online and laying the groundwork for Trump to cast aside the experts on his own coronavirus task force relies centrally on the idea that there is no expertise that rises above partisanship and that everyone has an agenda.Fauci an immunologist who graduated first in his class from Cornell’s medical school has been the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984. Between 1983 and 2002 he was the 13th most-cited scientist among the 2.5 million to 3 million authors worldwide and across all disciplines publishing in scientific journals according to the Institute for Scientific Information.Peter Barry Chowka whose Twitter bio boasts that he has been retweeted by the president recently referred to Fauci who has advised multiple presidents of both parties as a “Deep-State ­Hillary Clinton-loving stooge.” Trump has not brought these attacks to his own Twitter feed but he has surfaced previous pieces by Chowka including praise for Sean Hannity of Fox News.And the false caricature of Fauci has been embraced in some of the most avowedly pro-Trump corners of the Internet — places that seem remote from mainstream discourse until they wind up in presidential tweets or in a monologue on Fox.“Cross-pollination” between fringe sites and more credible conservative outlets occurs on news aggregators such as the Drudge Report said Carl Cameron who spent more than two decades as a reporter for Fox News before leaving in 2017.“These attacks do seem to get attention from the hosts at Fox” he said.Already the Pew Research Center has documented a remarkable divergence of views about the coronavirus outbreak based on news consumption. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans who turn to sources that cater to right-leaning audiences said that news outlets have greatly exaggerated the pandemic while 42 percent of Republicans who don’t follow such sources said the same.The attempt to discredit Fauci draws on a resource for which Trump has professed his “love” — WikiLeaks. Among the emails hacked by Russian agents and released by the anti-secrecy organization in 2016 was a message Fauci sent in 2013 to one of Clinton’s top aides Cheryl Mills. He praised the secretary of state’s “stamina and capability” during her testimony before the congressional committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi Libya.At the end of last week the right-wing website Gateway Pundit cited the email saying it came as “no surprise” because the doctor was also encouraging states to adopt restrictive measures that were “crashing their economies” and playing down hopes for possible coronavirus treatments. Jim Hoft the site’s editor published additional articles questioning Fauci’s approach to past health emergencies and chiding him for his “disrespectful interview undermining President Trump.”In an email Hoft said “I don’t have a problem with more information being shared about the doctor.”The same hacked email was the centerpiece of Chowka’s piece which appeared over the weekend on the conservative blog American Thinker.“So Fauci’s a typical deeply embedded administrative state hack who can be expected to be obsequious to his political bosses like Mrs. Clinton” Chowka wrote going on to accuse the infectious diseases expert of contradicting and undermining Trump.The appearance of tension between the president and the doctor caused Fauci in a radio interview on Tuesday to say that “pitting one against the other is just not helpful.” Trump also took steps to present a united front saying their relationship has been “very good.”Followers of the American Thinker have not received the message. Chowka’s piece has generated nearly 20000 interactions on Facebook alone — more than the typical well-performing story in the mainstream media. It has gained particular traction in ­Facebook groups devoted to Fox News personalities suggesting an overlapping audience as well as in state-specific groups such as Maine for Trump 2020 and New York for Trump. In a group for Massachusetts-based supporters of the president one user wrote “Never liked or trusted this person.”Separately a meme has been spreading in pro-Trump groups that shows an image of Fauci with his arm around House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the question “Look trustworthy to you?”The attacks have spread to other right-wing sites where Fauci stands accused of trying to turn the United States into “a police state like China in order to stop coronavirus.”Some of the most prominent conservative influencers including Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch and Bill Mitchell of “YourVoice America” have been amplifying the conspiracy theories to their hundreds of thousands of followers on Twitter. Both figures have been retweeted by the president Fitton as many as 100 times.Meanwhile at least two congressional candidates have participated in the smear campaign. Also spreading specious claims about Fauci is a highly active account on Twitter that has been featured by the One America News Network (OANN) a right-wing channel favored by the president that gained a seat in the White House briefing room in 2017. The account which uses the name Greg Rubini distorted 2017 comments from Fauci warning that the Trump administration would confront challenges from infectious diseases to claim that the doctor “made” and “funded” the novel virus.Last week in spreading unsubstantiated claims about the origins of the virus Chanel Rion an OANN reporter and former political illustrator for “anti-left caucuses” who accused the news media of spreading “Chinese Communist Party narratives” cited “Greg Rubini a citizen investigator and a monitored source amongst a certain set in the D.C. intelligence community.”The same account was involved in circulating the purported name of the whistleblower in the Ukraine scandal last fall.The claims don’t have buy-in from the Republican mainstream. But attempts to parry them have only illustrated their reach.Over the weekend Matt Whitlock a senior adviser to the National Republican Senatorial Committee wrote on Twitter “Shouldn’t need to be said but I personally couldn’t care less if Dr. Fauci said nice things to say about Hillary Clinton.”The “politicization of public health” means it very much does need to be said according to Robert Faris the research director at Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society.“Having Trump and Fauci on the same public stage at the same time is an untenable position for right-wing media” he said. “Something’s got to give and I don’t know what it is.”The most reliable avenues these outlets have for mainstream exposure Faris said is to seed their talking points into Fox News coverage or to get the direct attention of White House aides.“They’re both plausible though thankfully we don’t seem to be there yet” he added.

Between 1983 and 2002 he was the 13th most-cited scientist among the 2.5 million to 3 million authors worldwide and across all disciplines publishing in scientific journals according to the Institute for Scientific Information.Peter Barry Chowka whose Twitter bio boasts that he has been retweeted by the president recently referred to Fauci who has advised multiple presidents of both parties as a “Deep-State ­Hillary Clinton-loving stooge.” Trump has not brought these attacks to his own Twitter feed but he has surfaced previous pieces by Chowka including praise for Sean Hannity of Fox News.And the false caricature of Fauci has been embraced in some of the most avowedly pro-Trump corners of the Internet — places that seem remote from mainstream discourse until they wind up in presidential tweets or in a monologue on Fox.“Cross-pollination” between fringe sites and more credible conservative outlets occurs on news aggregators such as the Drudge Report said Carl Cameron who spent more than two decades as a reporter for Fox News before leaving in 2017.“These attacks do seem to get attention from the hosts at Fox” he said.Already the Pew Research Center has documented a remarkable divergence of views about the coronavirus outbreak based on news consumption. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans who turn to sources that cater to right-leaning audiences said that news outlets have greatly exaggerated the pandemic while 42 percent of Republicans who don’t follow such sources said the same.The attempt to discredit Fauci draws on a resource for which Trump has professed his “love” — WikiLeaks. Among the emails hacked by Russian agents and released by the anti-secrecy organization in 2016 was a message Fauci sent in 2013 to one of Clinton’s top aides Cheryl Mills. He praised the secretary of state’s “stamina and capability” during her testimony before the congressional committee investigating the 2012 attacks in Benghazi Libya.At the end of last week the right-wing website Gateway Pundit cited the email saying it came as “no surprise” because the doctor was also encouraging states to adopt restrictive measures that were “crashing their economies” and playing down hopes for possible coronavirus treatments. Jim Hoft the site’s editor published additional articles questioning Fauci’s approach to past health emergencies and chiding him for his “disrespectful interview undermining President Trump.”In an email Hoft said “I don’t have a problem with more information being shared about the doctor.”The same hacked email was the centerpiece of Chowka’s piece which appeared over the weekend on the conservative blog American Thinker.“So Fauci’s a typical deeply embedded administrative state hack who can be expected to be obsequious to his political bosses like Mrs. Clinton” Chowka wrote going on to accuse the infectious diseases expert of contradicting and undermining Trump.The appearance of tension between the president and the doctor caused Fauci in a radio interview on Tuesday to say that “pitting one against the other is just not helpful.” Trump also took steps to present a united front saying their relationship has been “very good.”Followers of the American Thinker have not received the message. Chowka’s piece has generated nearly 20000 interactions on Facebook alone — more than the typical well-performing story in the mainstream media. It has gained particular traction in ­Facebook groups devoted to Fox News personalities suggesting an overlapping audience as well as in state-specific groups such as Maine for Trump 2020 and New York for Trump. In a group for Massachusetts-based supporters of the president one user wrote “Never liked or trusted this person.”Separately a meme has been spreading in pro-Trump groups that shows an image of Fauci with his arm around House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the question “Look trustworthy to you?”The attacks have spread to other right-wing sites where Fauci stands accused of trying to turn the United States into “a police state like China in order to stop coronavirus.”Some of the most prominent conservative influencers including Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch and Bill Mitchell of “YourVoice America” have been amplifying the conspiracy theories to their hundreds of thousands of followers on Twitter. Both figures have been retweeted by the president Fitton as many as 100 times.Meanwhile at least two congressional candidates have participated in the smear campaign. Also spreading specious claims about Fauci is a highly active account on Twitter that has been featured by the One America News Network (OANN) a right-wing channel favored by the president that gained a seat in the White House briefing room in 2017. The account which uses the name Greg Rubini distorted 2017 comments from Fauci warning that the Trump administration would confront challenges from infectious diseases to claim that the doctor “made” and “funded” the novel virus.Last week in spreading unsubstantiated claims about the origins of the virus Chanel Rion an OANN reporter and former political illustrator for “anti-left caucuses” who accused the news media of spreading “Chinese Communist Party narratives” cited “Greg Rubini a citizen investigator and a monitored source amongst a certain set in the D.C. intelligence community.”The same account was involved in circulating the purported name of the whistleblower in the Ukraine scandal last fall.The claims don’t have buy-in from the Republican mainstream. But attempts to parry them have only illustrated their reach.Over the weekend Matt Whitlock a senior adviser to the National Republican Senatorial Committee wrote on Twitter “Shouldn’t need to be said but I personally couldn’t care less if Dr. Fauci said nice things to say about Hillary Clinton.”The “politicization of public health” means it very much does need to be said according to Robert Faris the research director at Harvard’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society.“Having Trump and Fauci on the same public stage at the same time is an untenable position for right-wing media” he said. “Something’s got to give and I don’t know what it is.”The most reliable avenues these outlets have for mainstream exposure Faris said is to seed their talking points into Fox News coverage or to get the direct attention of White House aides.“They’re both plausible though thankfully we don’t seem to be there yet” he added.
183,House leaders seek to expedite emergency aid package amid uncertainty about GOP lawmaker delaying measure,John Wagner Paul Kane and Mike DeBonis,The Washington Post,-1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-leaders-seek-to-expedite-emergency-aid-package-amid-uncertainty-about-gop-lawmaker-delaying-measure/2020/03/26/392c9dba-6f7d-11ea-a3ec-70d7479d83f0_story.html,House leaders sought to expedite the emergency $2 trillion relief bill aimed at mitigating the financial havoc caused by the coronavirus pandemic amid uncertainty about whether a renegade lawmaker could delay sending the measure to President Trump.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) agreed to approve the measure with a voice vote Friday that would not require all 430 current members of the House to travel to the Capitol given that two lawmakers have contracted the disease and others are self-quarantining due to exposure to confirmed carriers.The leadership also is taking meticulous steps to change the protocol for debate and voting to ensure the safety of lawmakers.But at least one lawmaker is considering upending the plans for swift passage. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said Thursday that he opposed the bill approved unanimously by the Senate on Wednesday as it would add to the national debt. The libertarian lawmaker also is concerned that voting without a quorum present — the majority of the House chamber — would violate the Constitution. He said he has yet to decide whether to press the issue which could delay a House vote until late Saturday or Sunday.At the White House on Thursday Trump acknowledged that one House member could slow the process.“You might have one grandstander and for that we’ll have to come back and take a little more time and it’ll pass it’ll just take a little longer. But let’s see whether or not we have a grandstander” Trump said.The planned vote Friday will culminate nearly two weeks of often heated debate about how to structure a sweeping bill that is attempting to provide hospitals and the health industry the tools to arrest the escalating spread of the virus and to shore up an economy that has gone into a free fall.The Labor Department reported Thursday that unemployment claims topped 3.3 million just last week in another blow to the economy.The sprawling legislation would send checks to more than 150 million American households set up enormous loan programs for businesses large and small pump billions of dollars into unemployment insurance programs greatly boost spending on hospitals and much more. Trump just before 1 a.m. Thursday joyfully tweeted about the Senate vote part of his effort to get the legislation to his desk as fast as possible.Massie traveled from his Kentucky home to Washington on Wednesday in anticipation of the final vote.“What the American people should ask is not why is one guy asking for everybody to follow the Constitution but why can’t these other people who are getting paid $174000 make the same trip that the truckers are making that are bringing the food to the grocery stores?” he asked.Pelosi said she was ready to defeat such an effort.“I feel certain that we will have a strong bipartisan vote” she said at a news conference Thursday morning.She did not address the specific issue raised by Massie but said she is prepared to deal with any member who objects to moving forward with a voice vote — as he and some others have suggested they might.At a subsequent news conference McCarthy said he thinks a voice vote on the bill will be sufficient. “I do not think there’s a need for anything else” he said.He noted that there will be time for debate on the House floor and those members that come to the House can make their views known.Six days: Tracking Sen. Rand Paul from coronavirus testing to positive diagnosisMcCarthy described several precautions that would be taken during Friday’s debate including wiping microphones after each speaker and ensuring that House members do not congregate closely. Members are also being encouraged to submit arguments via video so that they do not have to be in the Capitol and in a rare step C-SPAN has offered to air those statements to create a virtual debate.Only lawmakers who are overseeing the debate and those directly scheduled to speak will be permitted into the House chamber during the debate according to a memo issued by the House sergeant at arms. Elevator rides are limited to two people.The situation is so fluid that some lawmakers do not know whether they should attend Friday’s proceedings.Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has already returned to Washington at a moment when federal health experts have suggested anyone in the New York region self-quarantine for two weeks because the area has been the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak.In a brief interview Thursday she said she is asking for guidance about whether she can participate in the debate or just submit a video statement.A rising star among liberal activists Ocasio-Cortez has been considering voting against the legislation. She carried out her own internal debate Thursday through her Twitter account both criticizing Republicans for “holding hostage” hospitals and workers in exchange for a corporate bailout — but also praising nearly $1 trillion in funds.A Thursday afternoon conference call hosted for House Democrats in anticipation of the vote ended in confusion according to four people who participated and spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private call.All four cited a conflict between the guidance offered by Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.). Both said they hoped to clear the coronavirus rescue bill Friday morning by voice vote but they offered different messages on whether members should try to attend.Hoyer they said said that if Massie or some other lawmaker forced a recorded vote that would push deliberations to Saturday and there would be no need for any member to come to Washington on Friday unless they wanted to speak on the bill.But Pelosi toward the end of the call suggested that members who could travel to Washington should do so in hopes of resolving any possible issue Friday.Regardless of any Democratic opposition Pelosi made clear that no one on her side of the aisle would go the extra step and force a roll-call vote to delay the passage of legislation that is certain to pass on a strong bipartisan vote.She also began to spell what she wants to see in the fourth major piece of legislation dealing with coronavirus including more help for New York and other states hit hard by the outbreak. Pelosi also wants job safety provisions in the next legislation to protect those workers who are still going to offices manufacturing sites and hospitals potentially endangering themselves to contracting the virus.But McCarthy reflecting the reservations of a GOP caucus that used to preach fiscal discipline was cool to the idea of Congress tackling another bill in a matter of weeks.“Let’s let this bill work” he said before considering next steps.Pelosi indicated that any future effort would involve all four leaders in Congress. She intends to hunker down in Washington to work on the next steps rather than heading back to her home in San Francisco even though the House is not expected to be in session for weeks to come.“I’ll be working most of it from here” she told reporters.
184,The bad news for Trump amid his coronavirus poll bump,Aaron Blake ,The Washington Post,-1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/27/bad-news-trump-amid-his-coronavirus-poll-bump/,On its surface a new Washington Post-ABC News poll is the latest to offer good news for President Trump. His approval rating has reached a new high — as it has in other polls this week — and the overall view of his handling of the coronavirus outbreak is yet again positive.But this poll perhaps more than others suggests just how temporary that bump might be.In the poll 48 percent approve of Trump’s overall job performance — the first time his approval has been higher than his disapproval (46 percent) in any Post-ABC poll. His approval on his handling of the coronavirus is 51 percent vs. 45 percent negative. All of that is in line with other polls.But the Post-ABC poll asked one very specific question on the coronavirus that doesn’t reflect so favorably on Trump. It asked people whether they thought Trump was too slow to respond to the crisis or whether he reacted with the right speed. Fully 58 percent of people said he was too slow while just 38 percent said he reacted as quickly as he should have.So 58 percent say he was too slow but just 45 percent disapprove of his handling of it. In other words at least 1 in 8 Americans believe Trump failed to recognize and act upon the severity of the situation in the early days of the crisis but still give him a positive grade.That’s counterintuitive. This is a massive question when it comes to Trump’s stewardship of the situation because the earliest response is so critical. But people seem to be able to look past that — for now at least.The most logical takeaway is that this is some kind of rally-around-the-flag effect that we often see in these situations. In times of crisis polls regularly show people putting aside partisanship in the name of national unity and suddenly support a president they didn’t previously like. As Gallup has noted that rallying effect was more prevalent decades ago when our country wasn’t quite so polarized but it’s not shocking that it might apply to this situation now.Another part of the poll also speaks to this potential temporary rallying effect.Trump has made it abundantly clear that he’s worried about the outbreak depriving him of his calling-card issue in the 2020 election: the economy. As the Dow Jones industrial average at one point lost all of the huge gains registered during his presidency (and has since rebounded somewhat as Congress works toward passing a $2 trillion stimulus package) Trump has increasingly argued for a reopening of the economy.But despite that market free-fall Trump’s numbers on the economy jumped. The Post-ABC poll shows 57 percent approve of his handling of the economy vs. just 38 percent who disapprove. His plus-19 net margin on that is higher than ever before. He also leads former vice president Joe Biden when it comes to which of them would be better to handle the economy 50 percent to 42 percent.This is again counterintuitive. It would be understandable if people didn’t blame Trump for the tanking stock market and would instead very logically blame the coronavirus outbreak. But to actually see your approval on the economy go up at a time in which economic indicators increasingly point in the direction of a recession? That speaks to a rallying effect that may not last.The other key point here is that while Trump has gotten a bump it’s significantly smaller than the kind of bumps we’re used to in these situations. Jimmy Carter for instance saw his approval rating jump double digits during the Iran hostage crisis. George W. Bush’s skyrocketed after 9/11. John F. Kennedy also went up double digits during the Cuban missile crisis. Bill Clinton rose by double digits when his scandal came to light in 1998 and then again when he was impeached.Trump’s bump by contrast is in the mid-single digits even in his best polls — and is closer to nil in others. Perhaps that’s partially a symptom of our polarization but it doesn’t indicate a huge change in fundamentals for him.And the finding that he was too slow to address the coronavirus threat is also ominous. If that holds and the situation does get really bad it won’t be a great logical leap for people to believe that he has made things worse. Ditto his recent call to reopen parts of the economy which carries massive public health risks according to Trump’s own top health officials and comes at a time when polls show a strong majority support drastic measures to combat the virus.Trump’s handling of this situation has been unsteady and consistently factually challenged. Many people are either not consuming this or are willing to look past it for now. And his most devoted supporters will probably continue to do so regardless of what happens from here on out. But that doesn’t mean it will always be thus for people in the middle. And this poll for perhaps the first time speaks to lingering doubts about how up to the task he has been.
185,leadership on coronavirus aid: ‘We need a Tom Brady’,Robert Costa Laura Vozzella and Josh Dawsey,The Washington Post,-1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-governors-inslee-coronavirus/2020/03/26/afd25a8c-6f9a-11ea-b148-e4ce3fbd85b5_story.html,Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) clashed with President Trump during a conference call with governors on Thursday pleading with him to take more dramatic action to secure medical supplies for his state as it suffers from the coronavirus pandemic according to four people familiar with the call.After Trump told governors that his administration was ready to be the “backup” for states in crisis Inslee spoke up and said to the president “We don’t need a backup. We need a Tom Brady” a reference to the Super Bowl-winning quarterback who has been friendly with the president said the people familiar with the exchange with the president who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private conference call.Inslee they added also alluded to the Defense Production Act and said Washington state needs businesses to be more than encouraged to produce items such as masks and ventilators — they need a federal mandate to force them to act. He said the Pentagon needed to make immediate moves to prod defense companies to provide materials. And he spoke with urgency about the situation in nursing homes. A nursing home in Kirkland Wash. has been associated with at least 37 deaths from the coronavirus.Trump was defensive of his efforts two of the people said and told Inslee that he and the federal government have already done much for Washington and other states in recent days ticking off several initiatives.A spokesman for Inslee declined to comment. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Speaking to reporters in Washington after the call Inslee said of the discussion with Trump “I am not going to go into great detail but I will say that I told them that the states should not be competing against each other. We are grateful for their assistance in what they have provided so far.”Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.The exchange was the latest flash point as tensions rise between Trump and some local officials over his leadership during the coronavirus outbreak as some states see a spiraling numbers of cases and deaths during the pandemic.Earlier this month Trump called Inslee a “snake.”“I told [Vice President Pence] not to be complimentary of the governor because that governor is a snake” Trump said of Inslee. “And if you’re nice to him he will take advantage.”Inslee was not the only governor to sound the alarm according to one person briefed on the call with Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) raising a range of issues as New Orleans and his state brace for turmoil with the number of cases and deaths there rising. A senior administration official said Trump told Edwards during the call that the Federal Emergency Management Agency was granting his emergency request.Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) spoke first for the governors on the call as head of the National Governors Association. He made a plea for Maryland Virginia and Washington D.C. to get their own testing facility since the region is home to much of the workforce that keeps the federal government running according to people familiar with the call. A White House official said that was in the works.Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) voiced objection to the federal relief package that treats the District as a territory the people familiar said. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) a physician asked Deborah Birx who is a leader of the administration’s response for her best- and worst-case scenarios. She said she was still looking at modeling people familiar with the call said.The personal protective equipment shortage for health-care workers was the biggest concern expressed by governors who said they believed the country needed a federal response so states are not competing for medical supplies — a running theme of the discussion according to the people on it and briefed on it.Other moments of note included when Gov. Jim Justice of West Virginia (R) voiced concern about an outbreak at a nursing home the people familiar said. Meanwhile Gov. Henry McMaster (R-S.C.) a Trump ally told the president that small businesses cannot sustain too much more of the economic shutdown aides familiar with the call said.And Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves (R) told the president he appreciated him realizing that some states have worse situations than others and that parts of the country could reopen people familiar with the call said.Trump referred to the situation as “crazy” and said that the country has got to get back open for business the people familiar said.New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) the last governor to speak asked the president to work with governors saying that as administrators of their states they are “not political” according to a person familiar with the call. Trump appeared to like Cuomo’s comments and thanked him.Cuomo has been critical of the administration’s response but has also gone out of his way not to antagonize Trump as he seeks to secure as much federal help for his state as possible.Earlier on Thursday Trump sent a letter to the country’s governors advising them that his administration is developing “new guidelines” that can be used at the state and local level for determining the type of social distancing measures to be put in place amid the coronavirus pandemic.The guidelines will categorize each county in the country as low-risk medium-risk or high-risk Trump said.In the letter he said Americans are “hoping the day will soon arrive” when they can return to their normal lives.“In furtherance of this shared goal my Administration is working to publish new guidelines for State and local policymakers to use in making decisions about maintaining increasing or relaxing social distancing and other mitigation measures they have put in place” Trump wrote.The letter comes as public health officials have warned that prematurely reopening the country’s economy could exacerbate the spread of the virus. Trump has said that he would like to see the economy restarted by Easter April 12.Ovetta Wiggins Seung Min Kim and Felicia Sonmez contributed to this report.
186,Who are the lawmakers who have coronavirus or have self-quarantined for it?,Amber Phillips ,The Washington Post,-1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/13/members-of-congress-coronavirus-self-quarantine/,The coronavirus has reached Congress. Three members of Congress have tested positive for the virus. And more than two dozen members of Congress have self-quarantined for up to 14 days after brushes with the coronavirus. Several current and former staffers have also tested positive.Observing social distancing isn’t really an option for Congress. They are working to pass a massive aid package to bolster the economy which will likely require the Senate to stay in session and the House of Representative to come back to D.C. to vote. (Congress doesn’t vote remotely.)Here are the lawmakers who have been in quarantine over the coronavirus. Did we miss someone? Let us know.Who has the virus or has symptoms?Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.): He said Sunday he tested positive for the virus despite being asymptomatic. He was in the Senate going about his regular business and using the Senate gym in the days before he received his positive test.Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.): He only said March 25 he felt “under the weather” not that he has any specific coronavirus symptoms. But it was apparently serious enough for Thune who is in Senate GOP leadership to go home to South Dakota on the same day as the Senate voted to approve a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus and miss the vote.Rep. Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.): He said Wednesday he came down with symptoms Saturday evening. As The Post’s Colby Itkowitz reports that’s less than 24 hours after he stood on a crowded House floor to vote on a coronavirus aid package and after he had a “long” meeting with a top-ranking House Republican and others.Rep. Ben McAdams (D-Utah): His timeline is similar to Diaz-Balart’s. He said he developed a fever a dry cough and labored breathing Saturday evening after returning from D.C. They both were likely around dozens of people right before they tested positive for the virus.Rep. Ben McAdams✔@RepBenMcAdamsPlease read my statement on contracting #COVID19. I have self-quarantined since first having symptoms and consulted with my doctor. #utpolView image on Twitter44308:33 PM - Mar 18 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy2504 people are talking about thisRep. Seth Moulton (D-Ma.): The Boston Globe reported March 25 the congressman and former 2020 presidential candidate is quarantined at home with symptoms of coronavirus including fever and chest tightness but that because his symptoms are minor his doctor said he doesn’t qualify for a test.Rep. Katie Porter (D-Calif.): She announced March 25 that over the weekend she had cold-like symptoms fatigue and a 100.4 fever and will stay in quarantine for the time being until she gets the results of a coronavirus test.Who has self-quarantined after brushes with the virus?Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.): He was one of the first lawmakers to self-quarantine after coming into contact with someone at the Conservative Political Action Conference in late February who later tested positive for the virus. As his self-quarantine ended he announced he’d continue it because he had shaken hands twice with a Spanish politician this month who tested positive for the virus.On March 17 he announced he was done with both of his quarantines and was feeling fine.Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.): He said March 17 that a constituent who later tested positive came to his Washington office a week earlier. Earlier in the day Gardner attended a Senate Republican luncheon with most Republican senators and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.): He announced March 12 that he would be quarantining after learning about a Brazilian official who tested positive for the virus. Graham was with Trump and other Republican officials at Mar-a-Lago for a Brazilian presidential visit on Saturday. Graham tested negative.Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah): He said Sunday he would quarantine after spending time with Paul who tested positive for the virus. That means he will miss key votes on a massive coronavirus bailout package.Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah): He said Sunday he would quarantine after spending time with Paul who tested positive for the virus. That means he will miss key votes on a massive coronavirus bailout package. He said he tested negative for the virus.Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.): Scott also said March 12 that he was self-quarantining after being at Mar-a-Lago with the Brazilian official.Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.): He and his wife self-quarantined on March 10 after having dinner with someone they later found out was infected.Rep.

Joe Cunningham (D-S.C.): He said March 19 he will quarantine after coming into contact with one of the infected members of Congress.Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.): He said he will quarantine as of March 19 after he was around Diaz-Balart for “an extended period” last week.Rep. Douglas A. Collins: (R-Ga.): Like Cruz the top Republican during the impeachment investigations was among the group of Republican lawmakers who went into quarantine as of March 9 for coming into contact with an infected person at CPAC held at the end of February outside Washington.Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.): The impeachment manager is self-quarantining after coming into contact with a constituent who later tested positive for the virus the same constituent who also visited the office of Gardner reported 9 News Denver on March 17.Rep. Sharice Davids (D-Kansas): She said March 19 she is going into quarantine after coming into contact with a lawmaker who tested positive.Rep. Drew Ferguson (R-Ga.): He announced on March 18 shortly after Diaz-Balart and McAdams confirmed they have the virus that he was going into self-quarantine until March 27. He said he had a meeting with an infected member of Congress.Rep. Lizzle Fletcher (D-Texas): She announced March 26 she was in quarantine after experiencing flu-like symptoms including a 101-degree fever. She is awaiting a test result.Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.): Gaetz who wore a gas mask on the House floor to make light of the virus went into quarantine March 9 are he realized he was in contact with the same person at CPAC who prompted Cruz and Collins to self-quarantine. What’s more he was the lawmaker most in contact with the president at this time. Here’s The Post’s Ben Terris reporting on how Gaetz found out he needed to self-quarantine:He had just boarded Air Force One on Monday when he got a call informing him he’d had contact with a person infected with coronavirus the week before. Gaetz alerted the AF1 staff instantly and was put into an isolated office at the back of the plane only to later be called up to front by Trump so the president could give him “the typical lighthearted comfort that he usually does.”Gaetz’s self-quarantine appears to have ended by March 14; he was on TV all weekend.Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz): He quarantined March 8 like Cruz after CPAC.Rep. Kendra Horn (D-Okla.): She said March 19 she would self-quarantine for two weeks after coming into contact with McAdams who tested positive.Rep. Andy Kim (D-N.J.): He said March 19 he is in self-quarantine after coming into contact with one of the two infected members of Congress.Rep. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.): The assistant speaker to the House who also is a Democratic Senate candidate in New Mexico said on March 16 that he is quarantining after realizing Sunday he came into contact with someone who later tested positive.Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.): The outgoing congressman is Trump’s incoming White House chief of staff. He too went into quarantine March 9 after having contact with the infected person at CPAC. But he wasn’t in full quarantine. He was in the Oval Office with the president during that time.Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.): She said March 16 that she found out she came into contact with someone who tested positive on March 8 and will self-quarantine.Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.): She said March 18 she is self-quarantining because she came into contact with one of the infected members of Congress.Rep. Kathleen Rice (D-N.Y.): She said she was in quarantine after March 18 after coming into contact with someone “last Friday” who tested positive.Rep. David Price (D-N.C.): He said March 19 he and some of his staff will go into self quarantine after learning he had come into contact with an infected member of Congress most likely Diaz-Balart with whom he serves on a committee with.Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.): After finding out that he had a long meeting with Diaz-Balart who tested positive the No. 2 House Republican said March 18 he would go into self quarantine.Rep. David Schweikert (R-Ariz.): After a staffer tested positive he said March 15 that he and the staff in his two offices will work from home.Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.): Schiff isn’t quite in self-quarantine but he did say March 15 that he is working from home an indefinite amount of time in part because a former staffer lawyer Daniel Goldman who led questioning during the impeachment hearings tested positive for the virus. Schiff said he thought it happened after Goldman left the office 10 days earlier.Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.): She said she would quarantine March 18 after realizing she came into contact with an infected member of Congress.Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.): He said on March 15 he will work from home for a week and has been tested for coronavirus after being told he came into contact with someone tested positive.And one lawmaker who won’t self-quarantineRep. Louis Gohmert (R-Tex.) is among several lawmakers who came into contact with an infected person at that conservative conference in February. But he is the only one who refuses to self-quarantine saying he talked on the phone with a doctor from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He was spotted leading tours of children at the Capitol before tours there were suspended.Jeremy Herb✔@jeremyherbRep. Gohmert is still giving tours despite his contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus.

He said March 16 that one of his Delaware-based staffers tested positive for the virus and that he had no contact with that person.This has been updated with the latest.
187,The Daily 202: New York City is Ground Zero – again – with the coronavirus pandemic,James Hohmann,The Washington Post,-1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2020/03/27/daily-202-new-york-city-is-ground-zero-again-with-the-coronavirus-pandemic/5e7d9a0d88e0fa101a753f58/,With Mariana AlfaroEmergency Medical Service workers in New York were told on Tuesday night that 6406 people had called 911 seeking medical help in the preceding 24 hours. It was the highest volume of such calls recorded in the city surpassing the total from Sept. 11 2001 when the terrorist attack upended the city’s communication networks.A new record was set again on Wednesday with 6544 medical calls to 911. On Thursday evening EMS was on track to potentially receive as many as 7000 calls by midnight. Officials believe the numbers will only increase in the days ahead. Anecdotally friends sheltering-in-place at their apartments in Manhattan Brooklyn and Queens report hearing the haunting sound of ambulance sirens all night long.Eighteen-and-a-half-years after the trauma of 9/11 the novel coronavirus outbreak has again made New York into America’s Ground Zero. America’s financial and cultural capital faces another sneak attack from an enemy that’s once again indiscriminately targeting innocent civilians. There are obviously enormously significant differences between 2020 and 2001 but instead of hijacking our planes this unseen pathogen hijacks our lungs.Oren Barzilay president of Local 2507 which represents emergency medical technicians and paramedics in the New York City Fire Department confirmed the 911 call numbers. And a member of the fire department told my colleague Jesse Dougherty that the city’s EMS workers are “shockingly low” on personal protective equipment because that gear has to be switched out or discarded entirely after responding to coronavirus-related 911 calls.The United States has 85996 confirmed cases of covid-19 the disease caused by the virus and 1300 reported deaths. New York state has 39140 confirmed cases and 461 deaths with most concentrated around the nation’s largest city. That’s about 46 percent of the country’s cases. New Jersey and Connecticut which make up the tri-state area are also seeing spikes. At least 65 New York nurses have tested positive taking them off the front lines.More than 5300 people with the coronavirus are currently hospitalized in New York and about 1300 are being treated inside intensive care units. Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said the state has 53000 available hospital beds but will soon require up to 140000. That’s why plans are in motion to build 1000-bed facilities in each of the five boroughs and in four counties. One of the medical surge centers will be inside the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center on the west side of Manhattan where Hillary Clinton held her election night event in 2016 and which normally hosts auto shows and Comic-Con. New York leaders are also considering converting dormitories and hotel rooms for emergency use. A makeshift morgue is under construction outside one Manhattan hospital. “Part of the reason for the need for auxiliary emergency measures is that many hospitals have closed in recent years because of financial trouble” Ariana Eunjung Cha Brittney Martin and Steven Mufson explain. “The United States has fewer beds per capita — just 2.7 per 1000 people — than many other countries. That compares with 6.5 per 1000 for South Korea and France for example and 4.3 for China.”Pregnant women at two major hospital networks in New York are now being forced to give birth without their partners at their side. At Mount Sinai Hospital spouses and family members have been barred from entering the labor and delivery floor as part of a plan that treats every expectant mother as if she has the coronavirus per Brittany Shammas Frances Stead Sellers and Ariana.Despite the hellish deluge of bad news from his hometown President Trump called into Sean Hannity’s Fox News show on Thursday night to accuse the state’s governor of inflating how many ventilators New York really needs to cope with the expected influx of patients. Ventilators help a person with compromised lungs keep breathing. Cuomo said earlier in the day that the state needs about 30000 ventilators in the coming weeks but has so far acquired about 7000 with the Federal Emergency Management Agency offering to provide 400 more. Vice President Pence said the federal government will send an additional 4000 as part of an effort to “surge resources” into New York.Trump told Hannity that the onus should mainly be on the states to find their own ventilators and that the federal government is “a second line” of defense. “A lot of equipment’s being asked for that I don’t think they’ll need” Trump said. “I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they’re going to be. I don’t believe you need 40000 or 30000 ventilators. … When you talk about ventilators that’s sort of like buying a car. It’s very expensive.”But Trump and Cuomo are both supporting the use of an experimental treatment that is not proven to be effective against the coronavirus. “New York is moving at unprecedented speed and scale in a human experiment to distribute tens of thousands of doses of anti-malarial drugs to seriously ill patients” Chris Rowland Jon Swaine and Josh Dawsey report. “Health experts say the Food and Drug Administration has moved with uncommon speed to authorize New York’s sweeping plan to distribute the drugs through hospital networks. Planning for such a complex initiative would ordinarily take up to nine months … In New York that timeline has been compressed into three days. The effort has raised concerns among health experts about safety risks — including the danger of fatal heart arrhythmia and vision loss associated with the drugs — and of raising false hopes in the American public. But Trump’s direct intervention into complex medical issues as well as [Cuomo’s] embrace of the strategy has generated popular excitement about the drugs.”A silver lining: New York’s crime rate has plummeted amid the slowdown caused by the virus. Last week the city recorded a single murder compared with eight the week before. Burglaries and assaults were also way down per Shayna Jacobs and Devlin Barrett. This is notable because crime usually increases in the springtime when it gets nicer outside. New York also saw a drop in crime in the immediate aftermath of 9/11.Other hot spots to watch“Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) said Thursday that he was concerned about sharp rise in coronavirus cases in his state including one of the highest mortality rates in the country” Brady Dennis reports. “The state reported 510 newly confirmed cases of covid-19 bringing its total to 2305. Officials also reported 18 additional deaths — many of them in the hard-hit New Orleans area — bringing the state’s overall count to 83. One of them was a 17-year-old from Orleans Parish. … Federal officials also are keeping a close eye on the counties that include Detroit and Chicago as the next potential hotspots said Deborah Birx the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator.”Trump's former FDA commissioner who has been informally advising the coronavirus task force warned that the epidemic could become national in scope:Scott Gottlieb MD✔@ScottGottliebMDI’m worried about emerging situations in New Orleans Dallas Atlanta Miami Detroit Chicago Philadelphia among others. In China no province outside Hubei ever had more than 1500 cases. In U.S. 11 states already hit that total.

She told the Hill the CDC has deployed about 1500 of its epidemiologists scientists and experts to hot spots around the country including New York Seattle and New Orleans as well as states like Wisconsin and Colorado.Washington state where the curve might be flattening offers a reason for cautious optimism.“At EvergreenHealth Medical Center two miles from the shuttered Lifecare nursing home where 35 patient deaths were linked to the virus officials say their rate of new covid-19 cases has remained steady for two weeks leveling off at a trickle” Robert Klemko reports from Kirkland Wash. “On some days doctors here see just one new case and haven’t seen more than four in a single day since mid-March. Few need admission to the intensive care unit which is now half full two weeks after overflow necessitated transfers to nearby hospitals. … In the state that saw the nation’s first confirmed covid-19 case on Jan. 31 and the first recorded coronavirus-related death on Feb. 29 initial dire predictions of massive spikes have waned even as testing has increased rapidly. While the number of cases in Washington state grew by as much as 28 percent in one day on March 15 — it has since slowed significantly statewide.”“We don’t know if this last two weeks has been a calm before the storm or if the social distancing and all those things that are being practiced are working” said EvergreenHealth CEO Jeff Tomlin whose hospital has handled 40 of the state’s more than 130 virus-related deaths. He said the hospital is no longer overwhelmed though it still lacks needed supplies. “You will never hear me declaring victory at any point of this. … We’re gearing up just in case a surge does happen like in New York or in Italy.”
188,Pete Buttigieg on life after the trail whether Bernie Sanders should drop out and campaigning during coronavirus,Chelsea Janes ,The Washington Post,-1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/pete-buttigieg-on-life-after-the-trail-whether-bernie-sanders-should-drop-out-and-campaigning-during-coronavirus/2020/03/27/acca293a-6f97-11ea-aa80-c2470c6b2034_story.html,Just about three weeks have passed since Pete Buttigieg dropped out of the Democratic presidential primary throwing his support behind former vice president Joe Biden hours before Super Tuesday.Since then the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend Indiana has been keeping a low profile. Unlike many of his former rivals he had no day job to come back to. Instead Buttigieg said he’s been spending time with his husband cooking and adjusting to life off the road.Buttigieg is reemerging this week sitting for long-distance interviews and holding a coronavirus Q&A on Instagram on Wednesday. He spent a few minutes with The Post reflecting on his candidacy its end and the current state of the primary.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.How have you been adjusting to life after the campaign and to the realities of coronavirus?Buttigieg: You know it’s strange. First of all it’s already a radical shift to go from just the pace of campaigning to not. To do that also in the context of a lockdown is a whole different animal.And yet in a way maybe this is the only thing that could actually force me to one place and really detox from the constant motion of the campaign.In what ways did the campaign change you?PB: You get so used to everything revolving around this one goal — every thought every interaction. And it narrows you but it also means you always know what you’re about to talk about.So just having normal conversations takes an adjustment — a very pleasant one because your world widens a little bit. But suddenly you don’t have the subjects or the material that you’re used to going back to in conversations.Of course you’re getting used to not having the kind of staff that guided your every movement as well. You go from having hundreds of people help you do exactly one thing to thinking about how to assemble a small team that will help you do many things. It’s just a radical shift.You were always proud to tell voters that Forbes listed you as the least wealthy candidate in the field. Now you’re unemployed. So what’s next?PB: We’re going to be finding ways to engage on some of the policy issues that we really cared about and other ways to be out there in the conversation but none of that’s necessarily a job.So we’ll also be looking at ways to find more of an anchor. But [I’m] not in a hurry after the campaign and the speed of everything. It’s good to pause. This was supposed to be a week to be on vacation but obviously that’s not happening. But it’s still time to regroup and think and I decided not to say yes to anything too soon.Where were you going to go for vacation?PB: You know my goal was to be at the kind of place that’s in the stock photos for the hotel loyalty programs — a hut over the water somewhere. But Indiana will have to do for now.How tough was it to get out of the race when you did?PB: I knew that once the picture was clear in my head I had a responsibility to act quickly because the simple fact of staying in the race especially in that window between Saturday and Tuesday that each minute that we remained in the race mattered.Then I knew the other big thing besides getting into the race or getting out was whether to make an endorsement. So I spent Saturday night sleeping on the idea of stepping away and Sunday night sleeping on the idea of stepping out for Joe Biden.I felt good when I went to bed. I felt better when I got up. So I knew to act quickly on that front.What conversations did you feel you had to have before endorsing Biden?PB: I didn’t need to be courted. But I did just want to make sure that I was comfortable. You spend a year and a half making your own case. It takes a lot to shift gears and throw your support behind somebody else so quickly.But you know one of the themes that was really strong throughout the campaign was the importance of belonging and decency. Sometimes we used different words but it was very much the same theme. The idea of empathy and decency was so central and is so central to Joe Biden’s public presence in his campaign that the more I thought about it the more I felt there is this very natural line.What role did President Obama play in those last 24 hours?PB: None in terms of deciding what to do. He was very kind to call with kind words after I wrapped up the campaign. But the decision on what to do was really about me thinking about the right call and just getting comfortable with it.How do you expect to be involved in the Biden campaign?PB: I expected that I would be seeing [Biden] from time to time in the context of the campaign trail. But I’ve continued to be in touch with his team and there to be helpful in any way I can.We’ve seen the former vice president adopt plans of other former candidates into his platform over the last few weeks. Have you pushed any of your plans in particularly your Douglass Plan to fight systemic racism which you made such a centerpiece of your own campaign?PB: The Douglass Plan was a fantastic piece of work that I think deserves to be carried on not only in campaigns by the way but I think could be relevant in a lot of broader policy conversations and work that even goes outside of politics. It will be something I’m thinking about when I think about other activities and things I can be part of in the future.How do you think the former vice president should be campaigning and what should he be doing in this moment where traditional campaigning has been transformed because of the coronavirus?PB: When you’re a candidate everyone’s got advice about how to do your job. So I’m reluctant to add to that chorus.I will say I think that he has an opportunity — which I think he’s taking advantage of and I imagine will continue to develop — to show not just tell what it would be like to have a real president. And I think he can model a more compassionate and more fact-based approach to this situation that our country is going through.That’s what we’re seeing I think in terms of his increased presence on in the video work that they’re doing. I hope we see more and more of that because I think not just politically but I think it’s good for the country to see a different way of bringing us together and responding to all this.You were the recipient of plenty of skepticism from the left wing of the Democratic Party. Biden has received that kind of skepticism too. How do you think he and those around him should go about uniting the Democratic Party ahead of the general election?PB: I think most important thing is to focus on the substance of what we’re proposing. The platform that I’ve put together in my primary campaign if nominated would have made me the most progressive nominee of my lifetime and certainly president in my lifetime.If you look at the actual substance of what the Biden campaign is putting forward. It may not satisfy the same ideological tests as let’s say the [Bernie] Sanders platform does. But look at what this is about: empowering workers raising wages holding corporations accountable making our tax code fairer in a way that even Democrats didn’t dare to talk about just a couple of cycles ago.Who should Biden be looking at for vice president?PB: At the risk of sounding quaint I always said in my campaign that was the most important thing to think about when you’re identifying a future vice president is somebody who’s up to the job. And everything kind of flows from that. Of course nobody understands the vice presidency more than Joe Biden right now.So I trust his instincts to identify somebody who in a future administration can play such a key role.You dropped out of the race as soon as you saw you had no path to the nomination. Many believe Sen. Bernie Sanders has no path to the nomination but is taking a different approach. Is he hurting the Democrats’ chances in a general election by staying in the race?PB: I can’t really speculate on his thinking but I can tell you about mine. You know the way I thought about it and the way I came to terms with the decision as it all happened very quickly was: this is always about more than me getting into an office.The whole idea of me running for president was to advance a certain vision not the other way around. And that vision was about unifying the country unifying the party and bringing an end to the Trump era.I thought that I could serve those goals by becoming the nominee. Then one day it became clear that I could best serve those goals by getting out of the race. I would hope that any candidate even though it’s hard to do in the heat of campaigning will step back and think about what your candidacy is for.I certainly think that the best values that could motivate anyone to run for president as a Democrat right now in this moment those values I would hope point away toward doing everything we can to bring the party together into defeat this President.
189,The bad news for Trump amid his coronavirus poll bump,Aaron Blake ,The Washington Post,-1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/27/bad-news-trump-amid-his-coronavirus-poll-bump/,On its surface a new Washington Post-ABC News poll is the latest to offer good news for President Trump. His approval rating has reached a new high — as it has in other polls this week — and the overall view of his handling of the coronavirus outbreak is yet again positive.But this poll perhaps more than others suggests just how temporary that bump might be.In the poll 48 percent approve of Trump’s overall job performance — the first time his approval has been higher than his disapproval (46 percent) in any Post-ABC poll. His approval on his handling of the coronavirus is 51 percent vs. 45 percent negative. All of that is in line with other polls.But the Post-ABC poll asked one very specific question on the coronavirus that doesn’t reflect so favorably on Trump. It asked people whether they thought Trump was too slow to respond to the crisis or whether he reacted with the right speed. Fully 58 percent of people said he was too slow while just 38 percent said he reacted as quickly as he should have.So 58 percent say he was too slow but just 45 percent disapprove of his handling of it. In other words at least 1 in 8 Americans believe Trump failed to recognize and act upon the severity of the situation in the early days of the crisis but still give him a positive grade.That’s counterintuitive. This is a massive question when it comes to Trump’s stewardship of the situation because the earliest response is so critical. But people seem to be able to look past that — for now at least.The most logical takeaway is that this is some kind of rally-around-the-flag effect that we often see in these situations. In times of crisis polls regularly show people putting aside partisanship in the name of national unity and suddenly support a president they didn’t previously like. As Gallup has noted that rallying effect was more prevalent decades ago when our country wasn’t quite so polarized but it’s not shocking that it might apply to this situation now.Another part of the poll also speaks to this potential temporary rallying effect.Trump has made it abundantly clear that he’s worried about the outbreak depriving him of his calling-card issue in the 2020 election: the economy. As the Dow Jones industrial average at one point lost all of the huge gains registered during his presidency (and has since rebounded somewhat as Congress works toward passing a $2 trillion stimulus package) Trump has increasingly argued for a reopening of the economy.But despite that market free-fall Trump’s numbers on the economy jumped. The Post-ABC poll shows 57 percent approve of his handling of the economy vs. just 38 percent who disapprove. His plus-19 net margin on that is higher than ever before. He also leads former vice president Joe Biden when it comes to which of them would be better to handle the economy 50 percent to 42 percent.This is again counterintuitive. It would be understandable if people didn’t blame Trump for the tanking stock market and would instead very logically blame the coronavirus outbreak. But to actually see your approval on the economy go up at a time in which economic indicators increasingly point in the direction of a recession? That speaks to a rallying effect that may not last.The other key point here is that while Trump has gotten a bump it’s significantly smaller than the kind of bumps we’re used to in these situations. Jimmy Carter for instance saw his approval rating jump double digits during the Iran hostage crisis. George W. Bush’s skyrocketed after 9/11. John F. Kennedy also went up double digits during the Cuban missile crisis. Bill Clinton rose by double digits when his scandal came to light in 1998 and then again when he was impeached.Trump’s bump by contrast is in the mid-single digits even in his best polls — and is closer to nil in others. Perhaps that’s partially a symptom of our polarization but it doesn’t indicate a huge change in fundamentals for him.And the finding that he was too slow to address the coronavirus threat is also ominous. If that holds and the situation does get really bad it won’t be a great logical leap for people to believe that he has made things worse. Ditto his recent call to reopen parts of the economy which carries massive public health risks according to Trump’s own top health officials and comes at a time when polls show a strong majority support drastic measures to combat the virus.Trump’s handling of this situation has been unsteady and consistently factually challenged. Many people are either not consuming this or are willing to look past it for now. And his most devoted supporters will probably continue to do so regardless of what happens from here on out. But that doesn’t mean it will always be thus for people in the middle. And this poll for perhaps the first time speaks to lingering doubts about how up to the task he has been.
190,Andrew Cuomo during the covid-19 crisis is the same as ever with one big difference: People like him,Sarah Ellison and Ben Terris,The Washington Post,-1,https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/andrew-cuomo-during-the-covid-19-crisis-is-the-same-as-ever-with-one-big-difference-people-like-him/2020/03/28/11a89a0a-6fd7-11ea-b148-e4ce3fbd85b5_story.html,One odd side effect of covid-19 has been what it does to taste. Even those who have avoided the illness enjoy things they once disliked: Government spending. Facetiming with family.Andrew M. Cuomo.The governor of New York’s morning news conferences have become part of the country’s new daily rhythm. He is broadcast live from the wood-paneled Red Room of the state capitol building or New York City’s convention center — a leader in a polo shirt or neatly knotted tie projecting competence to go along with the PowerPoint projection of hard truths. And to the surprise of anyone who has watched his State of the State it’s must-see television.First come the facts. In a matter of days there are no cases then 30000 cases then nearly 45000 cases in New York state. “That’s a problem” he says. They are running out of beds and ventilators. He doesn’t shy away from that. “That’s a challenge.” He pauses.“Take a breath” he says and when he starts to talk again it is the revival portion of the meeting. There are moving stories about New York his mother his father and all of humanity. The density of the state — its “closeness” he says — is its vulnerability in this moment. But it is also what will get it through. He is talking to New York but the whole country is listening to the Cuomo Monologues: part briefing part sermon part inspirational talk.By the end viewers at home are getting choked up and people in California and Colorado are texting about him. They’ll tune in later to watch as he and his younger brother CNN anchor Chris Cuomo rib one another about who mom loves more amid the coverage of impending doom.The comedian Chelsea Handler is attracted to him. Even women who used to despise him find him irresistible. His enemies give him praise.The coronavirus crisis has reintroduced the nation to a different cast of Democratic leaders. Former vice president Joe Biden — the supposed standard-bearer of the party — has been largely missing as governors like Jay Inslee of Washington state Gavin Newsom of California and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan find the spotlight. And no one is on a bigger stage right now than Cuomo.It’s an interesting turn of events for a governor who has mostly been known as a micromanager a bully a vacuum cleaner set on high to suck up power.Plenty of Americans have had a thing for “tough guys” before. Trump became president after all. People don’t seem to mind a jerk if he’s their jerk.It helps Cuomo that the other daily programming is the president’s presser equal parts bravado and wishful thinking underscoring a message that conjures a deadbeat dad — “I take no responsibility at all.”It can make Cuomo’s faults feel reasonable. He’s the strongman who can admit he’s wrong. He speaks fluently about the facts. He worries about his mother and by extension yours too.He can screw up. Cuomo who declined an interview for this story got into a public bickering match with his old rival New York Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) about a shelter-in-place order and wavered on whether to close New York’s schools. He shut down nonessential businesses after California did. When Cuomo decided to use the state’s prisoners to produce hand sanitizer critics howled that he was exploiting what was essentially slave labor in a health crisis. Just this past week citing an academic study Cuomo wondered whether parts of mandatory quarantine like sending people — both those in college and those without the savings to live on their own without a job — back home to live with their vulnerable parents may not have been the best decision. But at least he doesn’t go against his own scientific advisers about when to open businesses back up.“All of those attributes that at times grate at people — even like me who want to poke him sometimes — frankly are useful in an emergency” said Marc Molinaro Dutchess County executive and Cuomo’s 2018 Republican opponent in the governor’s race.The state now accounts for more than half of all cases of covid-19 in the country and after he granted himself immense power to make unilateral decisions the success of the response largely falls to Cuomo and his ability to work with the federal government.“This is not a time to play nice in the sandbox” he said at Wednesday’s news conference.“We are going to go out and kick coronavirus’s a--” he said Friday.As recently as last summer New Yorkers seemed to be sick of the Cuomo show. A three-term governor and the son of another the late Mario Cuomo Andrew has spent more than two decades in and around the Executive Mansion.Where his father was called a political visionary as close to a poet as Albany may ever see Andrew M. Cuomo has long been thought of as more of a blunt object.“Mario Cuomo loved the art of thinking of grappling with concepts” said Steve Cohen a former secretary to Andrew Cuomo who also worked for his father. Andrew is in some ways a reaction to his father. “He is every bit the intellectual his father was but he is also very pragmatic. Andrew believes you need to actually get things done. If you can’t get things done a lofty philosophy is a luxury.”If Andrew Cuomo wanted to get it done he often did: driving strict gun-control measures minimum-wage hikes and some of the most expansive infrastructure projects in the history of the state. He has also dealt with acute disasters before including Hurricane Irene and Superstorm Sandy. After Hurricane Irene washed out a major thoroughfare in the Adirondacks in 2011 Cuomo got on the phone to threaten the contractor on the reconstruction job that if he didn’t fix the roads within a week he’d never work in New York again. After Superstorm Sandy Cuomo eviscerated the local power authority for mismanaging power outages and drove legislation to overhaul it.“This is the Cuomo disaster playbook” said Josh Vlasto former deputy communications director for Cuomo. “Hands on fully immersive direct and clear communication and completely blowing through bureaucracy even if it is his own bureaucracy.”But the go-it-alone attitude has been frustrating to some especially the many Democrats who fall to his left and feel he hasn’t done enough to address inequality. And at its worst Cuomo’s brusque leadership style can give the impression that not everything is on the level.In July 2013 Cuomo sat in the same Red Room and announced that in response to a spate of scandals plaguing the state House he was forming an independent panel of lawyers and investigators to crack down on corruption.“The people of this state should sleep better tonight” he said announcing what would be called the Moreland Commission.But when the commission started looking into entities tangentially connected to the governor he shut it down months ahead of schedule.“This was an edict by the governor that we should uncover whatever might be going on in the state” said Barbara Bartoletti a former adviser to the commission. “What he did not apparently want us to do was get close to him. And that’s when it started to fall apart.”But what counts as good government in a crisis? Sometimes it’s a heavy hand.In late February Cuomo secured $40 million in a bill that gave him broad authority to combat the virus without having to seek approval from the legislature.“If the legislature abdicates their role he’s the type of governor who like a large celestial object acting with the laws of gravity will pull more power to him” said Blair Horner who used to work for Cuomo and is now a regular critic. “But maybe right now it’s the only option.”A lack of options has driven the governor into regular contact with a fellow New Yorker he's known for 30 years: President Trump. The two are on the phone every day often multiple times. Along with the rest of the country Trump regularly tunes into Cuomo's news conferences and by some accounts has tried to emulate his tone.For the most part the two have been careful to praise one another in public. But they both have their limits. Earlier this month the president tweeted that Cuomo needed to “do more” which rankled the governor enough for him to respond: “No — YOU have to do something. You’re supposed to be the President.” Ultimately Trump deleted his tweet and told Fox News’s Sean Hannity “Generally speaking I’m getting along very well with Governor Cuomo.”“They are just two boys from Queens right?” said Rep. Max Rose a freshman Democrat who represents parts of Brooklyn and Staten Island. “Considering the two personalities involved and their history it is notable the degree to which they have worked with each other.”In their latest run-in Trump floated a quarantine of New York New Jersey and Connecticut without telling Cuomo or the other governors. Aides spent hours talking the president out of it. Then Trump called Cuomo to say he’d relented.Cuomo has said he’s trying to keep his emotions in check these days and he reserves his flashes of anger not for Trump but for the federal government itself calling its $2 trillion aid package “reckless” and “irresponsible” for not doing enough to help New Yorkers. So what does he do when the feds don’t come through? Same thing he always does: turn to his own New York network. Early on he called his father’s former health commissioner to try to expand testing for coronavirus in New York. “He got very very involved to facilitate regulatory approval to make sure our lab got up and running in a very coordinated way with the state lab” said Michael Dowling president and CEO of Northwell Health the largest health system in the state. Cuomo visited Northwell’s lab in early March to inspect the facility. It is now conducting 1700 hundred tests a day according to Dowling. “Andrew has been leadership in action” he said.Cuomo’s crisis management has earned plenty of rave reviews but as the state becomes the worldwide coronavirus epicenter it’s unclear whether anyone will ultimately be seen as a winner. Already there have been questions about whether keeping the New York City subway open has allowed the virus to spread. (Dani Lever Cuomo’s communications director said subways are open so essential staffers — doctors nurses and police officers — can report to work.) Has Cuomo done enough to protect the vulnerable populations of New York City especially those in prison? News stories have already started to critique his response. And while the governor has been talking about the virus since January would he not have saved more lives if at the end of February he hadn’t made reassuring statements such as: “This situation is not a situation that should cause undue fear”?“In an emergency no matter what there are going to be a thousand things that could have been done differently and that we should learn from for the next time” said Molinaro Cuomo’s former opponent. “But I was also once a volunteer fireman and you want to put the fire out before you look for the missteps.”If Cuomo is able to help stave off this disaster it will further fuel speculation about him seeking higher office in the future an ambition his aides deny. The president’s praise has wavered the more Cuomo’s star has risen. Hannity Trump’s mouthpiece and muse recently berated Cuomo whose requests for supplies have grown ever more urgent.“The cynic in me — and I’ve known him a long time — thinks he is setting himself up for 2024. He certainly wants to save lives in New York he’s genuine about that but he’s a political animal and always has been” Bartoletti said.“He has his eye on one thing right now — being governor in a time of crisis. There is no 2024. It doesn’t exist to him” Cohen said. “What exists is now.”
191,Congress puts aside its habitual dysfunction and responds to covid-19,,The Economist,-1,https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/03/26/congress-puts-aside-its-habitual-dysfunction-and-responds-to-covid-19,EVEN TO THE housebound and socially distanced the signs of a contraction are apparent. The 18th Street corridor of Adams Morgan a typically bustling stretch of restaurants and shops in Washington DC is shuttered—closed as part of the nationwide effort to contain the epidemic of covid-19 that had as of March 25th infected 65778 Americans and killed 942 according to Johns Hopkins University. One fledgling business—a new bar called Death Punch—never managed to open its doors. Down the road an established whiskey bar called Jack Rose has been selling off its gargantuan collection at discount to support its staff. The queue for it snaked several blocks—a long dotted line of aficionados standing a careful six feet apart.These are just the premonitions of the pain to come. Unemployment will rocket as much of the economy is put into a sort of medically induced coma. So many unemployment claims are being filed in Ohio that the state website has crashed. The national weekly unemployment numbers that will be released on March 26th are widely expected to be the worst in history. Goldman Sachs has predicted that there could be 2.25m new claims over the week—triple the previous record. And just as the covid-19 epidemic has not yet reached its apex neither has the economic crisis. Morgan Stanley predicts that GDP will fall by 8% year-on-year in the second quarter and unemployment will rise to 12.8% compared with just 3.5% in February.To head off the damage Congress has prepared the largest fiscal stimulus in modern history. Its provisions—including bail-outs for firms both big and small expanded unemployment-insurance benefits and a straight cash transfer to Americans—are expected to cost close to $2trn roughly one-tenth of GDP. This is the third substantial piece of legislation to deal with covid-19. Even this may not be enough.Whole industries rely on congregating people. So too unfortunately does the virus. Twelve states have ordered all non-essential businesses closed. Seventeen states covering half the country’s population have urged residents to stay at home. Many white-collar tasks can just about be performed remotely. But cruelly those likeliest to lose income or their jobs are in more precarious less well-paid industries—restaurant staff (of which there are 9.6m) retailers (8.8m) or hotel workers (2m). If they lose their livelihoods the effects will ripple through the economy.One corrective for this problem is unemployment insurance. Yet this is not as robust as in other parts of the rich world. The American version replaces a smaller share of previous income than the average in the OECD a club of mostly rich countries and declines faster with time. Individual states which administer the programme jointly with the federal government differ in their generosity: Mississippi caps its maximum benefits at a paltry $235 a week.At the insistence of Democrats Congress would make this part of the safety-net decidedly more European at least temporarily. The federal government would pay to top up unemployment-benefit levels by $600 a week—an enormous increase given that the current weekly average is $385. The set of people eligible for benefits would also be expanded to include independent contractors such as gig-economy workers. Those who have been laid off but not fired could receive compensation for lost hours. And the length of the benefit period would be extended from the usual 26 weeks to 39 weeks. The cost of all of this is thought to be $260bn: a serious expansion of a targeted programme.A similarly gargantuan wad of cash—$250bn—will be spent on a less targeted scheme sending cheques to Americans direct from Uncle Sam. Below some generous income thresholds ($75000 a year for a single person and $150000 for a married couple) every family can expect $1200 per adult and $500 per child. This is the best version of a cash transfer that was proposed. Previously the White House had pushed the idea of a payroll-tax holiday; an early version of the stimulus bill ignored people who did not file taxes. Both would have excluded those with the lowest incomes from an ostensibly universal programme. Reaching everyone eligible now will require ingenuity such as using administrative data from states says Sam Hammond of the Niskanen Centre a think-tank. But even if sent quickly the cheques could be both too small for those who need them and too big for those who do not.The government is also expected to set aside $500bn to stabilise firms and states. The capital could facilitate lending several times larger than that. Democrats in Congress and the White House got stuck on a (relatively) small portion of the programme the $75bn set aside to bail out embattled big firms like airlines and those deemed critical to national security—because of the latitude the treasury secretary would have to set and disclose the terms of loans. A compromise struck in the dead of night bulked up independent oversight.A more intriguing scheme is the $350bn set aside to save small and medium-size firms (those with fewer than 500 employees). The programme would give loans of up to $10m without interest or fees to pay for employees rental costs and sundry other expenses. These would then be forgiven in proportion to the share of staff spared the sack: a firm that kept all employees would owe nothing; one that dispensed with half would owe half and so on.This is a more complicated idea than those devised by European finance ministers facing down the pandemic. Rishi Sunak the British chancellor pledged to pay up to 80% of wages for furloughed workers; the Danish government could pay up to 90% of the costs. The added hurdle in America may mean that the most sophisticated operations get the grant-loans (or “groans” in bureaucratic argot) while mom-and-pop operations languish. It may also mean that even more money will be needed. Research from Glenn Hubbard an economist at Columbia Business School and Michael Strain of the American Enterprise Institute a think-tank estimates that total needs could amount to $1.2trn—roughly triple the sum allocated. With the ink not yet dry on the phase-three bill bigger bail-outs may be needed in future.The extraordinary legislation is not intended to avoid the recession that already seems to have arrived but to spur the fastest possible rebound. This of course requires that the cause—the covid-19 pandemic—is effectively dealt with first.But after a brief period of taking the virus seriously President Donald Trump seems eager to lift restrictions as soon as possible. He has taken to saying that “the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself” and that he wants the country “opened up and just raring to go by Easter” which epidemiological projections suggest is unwise. The collapse of the stockmarket which used to be Mr Trump’s barometer of success may be spooking the president. Markets jumped in anticipation of the coming stimulus. But pre-emptively relaxing the restrictions would harm both public health and the economy.Because health authority is devolved to the states it is unlikely that Mr Trump would pre-empt local declarations of emergency. But some states could follow suit and the president’s supporters might not adhere to the recommended course of social distancing. Already the lieutenant-governor of Texas has suggested that the elderly might risk death for the sake of the economy. Liberty University an evangelical Christian institution led by a devotee of the president’s is proudly inviting thousands of students back to campus in defiance of public-health advice.Mr Trump appears to be defaulting into an old playbook—vacillating wildly in the hope of winning concessions. What may work with Democrats or North Korean dictators has no chance against a virus however. And as things worsen as seems likely such irresolution may look like political malpractice. Already New York appears to be a new disease hotspot. “The apex is higher than we thought and the apex is sooner than we thought” said Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York in his address to citizens. He is warning that the city’s health system could be overwhelmed by lack of ventilators and protective equipment for staff. The medicine—a controlled national shutdown of the economy—may be strong stuff. But a premature reopening leading to rampant transmission of the virus could produce something far worse.
192,The virus should speed efforts to shrink America’s prison population,,The Economist,-1,https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/03/26/the-virus-should-speed-efforts-to-shrink-americas-prison-population,FACED WITH a pandemic officials rush to close any place that threatens to become a centre of transmission. If fewer people mingle inside cruise ships schools churches or retirement homes then the risk of mass infections falls. Yet for more than 2m Americans squeezed into jails and prisons along with many staff a shutdown is not an option. Instead such places risk becoming hotspots for disease. In 1918 the Spanish flu raged through San Quentin prison in California infecting 500 of its 1900 inmates in just two months.Anxiety is rising by the day. The sheriff of Harris County Texas has likened his huge jail to “a perfect incubator” for covid-19 saying an outbreak would spread like “wildfire”. Inmates at an immigrant-detention centre in New Jersey have launched a hunger strike to demand soap. At Rikers Island in New York prisoners this week refused to leave their dormitories worrying about infections. Tom Dart sheriff of Cook County who runs a large jail in Chicago warns he is “juggling with impending disaster”. Some prisoners have the virus but he lacks tests for checking others or even protective gear for staff.“Universities and hotels you can close. I’m left with people I can’t send home” says Sheriff Dart. Instead he improvises. He clumps new arrivals in cohorts by the day they come in hoping to isolate potentially sick ones for at least a week to prevent any infection spreading. Tents for quarantine are now going up in place of a mental-health centre. Staff take inmates’ temperatures quiz them about sickness in the family and spray food trays with bleach water more often than before.Such efforts are well-meant but inadequate. The virus is already spreading behind bars. Prisons in every state now ban regular visitors. In 15 states even lawyers are blocked. As staff and volunteers who provide education therapy and other services also stay away another risk is that morale will fall to be replaced by mounting fear and frustration. That bodes ill for good order. In Italy similar efforts to contain the virus this month provoked at least 25 prison riots and several deaths.Inmates are often packed close and obliged to buy their own soap—seen as a luxury not a basic need—from meagre earnings. They will struggle to fend off infection. Pam Oliver a sociologist who studies prisons in Wisconsin calls the lack of hygiene “extremely dangerous”. The current crisis at least is raising public awareness of “severe overcrowding and unsanitary conditions” for those locked up says Inimai Chettiar of Justice Action Network which campaigns for reform.In Harris County some pregnant inmates have been released. Those protesting in Rikers want detainees aged 50 or older sent home. Ohio’s chief justice has said that people at highest risk of infection must be isolated outside jails. Ms Oliver notes that older inmates are both at risk and pose little threat as they are unlikely to reoffend. A bill HR4018 which was unanimously passed by the House last year and is waiting to go before the Senate would make it easier for elderly prisoners to serve the final third of their sentences at home.Another effort in many states aims to prevent people entering jails in the first place. Sheriff Dart in Chicago says daily arrivals have recently fallen by nearly half from 100 as police issue more citations and arrest fewer offenders. That is becoming common in dozens of counties and cities. In Baltimore the state attorney Marilyn Mosby has told prosecutors to stop charging non-violent offenders such as those caught dealing drugs trespassing or illegally selling sex. In Los Angeles where 17000 are in jail on an average day officials are aiming to get the population down by 2000. Daily arrests there have dropped from 300 to 60 says the sheriff.Amid all this there is an opportunity to release those whose detention does little for public safety. Of the 1.29m in state prisons according to the Prison Policy Initiative a think-tank nearly half are held for non-violent crimes. Three-quarters of the 631000 in jails are awaiting trial mostly on non-violent charges. Those held for breaking parole conditions or not posting bail and those nearing the end of their sentences may all be let out early. Montana’s chief justice has called for judges to free “as many prisoners as you are able” in such categories. One county jail in Kentucky released 120 of its 697 detainees this month.The remaining population will be harder to reduce but some individuals who are classed as “violent offenders” probably also pose little threat to public safety says Julian Adler at the Centre for Court Innovation in New York. He points out that some defendants strike plea bargains and get a record as violent though they have never inflicted or threatened physical harm on any victim. “Statistics can mislead” he says. A getaway driver convicted as an accessory to a robber may count as a violent felon. So may someone who brawled in a bar. Mr Adler hopes the current push to rethink who should be kept inside will change public attitudes in the longer term.This wish may not be forlorn. Efforts are under way in several states to change laws so as to shrink the incarcerated population: by doing away with cash bail for example or by getting police to carry out fewer arrests for misdemeanours. Such existing programmes are routinely backed by both political parties and have made it easier to respond quickly in the face of covid-19 according to Laurie Garduque of the MacArthur Foundation which funds research on jail reform. The speedy action of many courts sheriffs and other officials in the past week or so she describes as admirable. The pandemic brings a reminder that society’s most vulnerable—the poor homeless and mentally ill—commonly end up in jails. Efforts to help them now are “not radical” says Ms Garduque “but are pushing in the same direction that we knew from before.” After the pandemic she predicts “we can go even further.”
193,Howie Hawkins will probably be the Green Party’s 2020 nominee,Zowie Howie,The Economist,-1,https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/03/26/howie-hawkins-will-probably-be-the-green-partys-2020-nominee,HOWIE HAWKINS the front-runner for the Green Party’s presidential nomination is inclined to look on the bright side. Munching on oatmeal during a recent campaign visit to Chicago the genial white-bearded 67-year-old lists reasons for his optimism. First comes his record of pursuing seemingly lost causes. The ex-Marine construction worker lorry-unloader and member of the Teamsters says “I’ve been on the unpopular side that proved right in the end several times.”As a teenager in 1960s San Francisco he joined the Peace and Freedom Party demanding an end to the war in Vietnam. As a student at Dartmouth College he helped the Clam Shell Alliance stir opposition to nuclear power in New Hampshire. He marched for civil rights in America and opposed apartheid in South Africa. As a long-standing democratic socialist he first dropped leaflets for Bernie Sanders in Vermont in the 1970s. Today he sees more Americans than ever welcoming ideas of “eco-socialism”. Triumphs don’t come easy but “it’s a matter of time until we win people over” he says.For Greens the purpose of the election is twofold. One is to use the campaign to build the party win volunteers and find recruits who can later run for local office beginning with county boards. Without this he says the party will never gain national appeal. The second purpose is to press other parties to adopt green policies. He cites his own record of running to be governor of New York. In the 2014 race he won nearly 5% of the vote enough to spook Andrew Cuomo a Democrat into taking up greener leftier policies such as a ban on fracking and plans for paid family leave and cheaper college.He also cites the Green New Deal which he says he has pushed since 2010. A version of it was adopted by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other Democrats in the House. He sniffs that they have watered it down—“They took the brand and eliminated the content”—since their ambition is zero carbon emissions for America by 2050 and he says it must be 2030. He is pleased nonetheless that the plan is spreading.His other policy ideas are equally bold amounting to a $23trn plan to reshape the economy impose a carbon tax bring in a national health service electrify all railways put light-rail and other public transport in all cities and build up a machine-tools industry to make new environmental equipment such as electric furnaces for steelmakers. He would also prevent the plastics industry from using petrochemicals and encourage the use of carbon-free cement for construction.What of the party he helped to found? Mr Hawkins who has won almost all the state primaries so far and expects to be picked in July at a convention in Detroit wants the Greens to weave together their various strands of peace activists social-justice campaigners and ecologists. They are still too “atomised” and prone to ideological squabbles he says. Until they get over that mass appeal will not follow.Other countries show what might be possible. Greens in many rich democracies have sprouted vigorously in recent years. In Germany for example they could help form the next government. America’s system squeezes third parties but elsewhere even where first-past-the-post electoral politics hurts small ones as in Britain and Canada the odd Green MP gets elected. American voters say they want to tackle climate change. Disaffection with traditional parties is rising. And if there ever were electoral reform—such as a switch to ranked-choice voting—smaller parties could gain.As for the 2020 election Mr Hawkins hopes to appeal to young fervent and disgruntled supporters of Mr Sanders upset that their candidate has been pushed aside by Democratic primary voters. If the Democratic convention were to prove a bitterly contested one some “Bernie bros” could give Howie a look. This raises a spectre for the Democratic Party. Ralph Nader running as an independent in 2000 picked up 2.8m ballots (nearly 3%) in a tight presidential race a tally that helped to keep Al Gore out of the White House. In 2016 Jill Stein the Green Party’s candidate helped by Russian meddlers received 1.5m votes (1%) many of them in crucial midwestern states that Donald Trump narrowly won.A repeat performance is unlikely. Polling by YouGov for The Economist shows support for third-party candidates at 3% half of what they won in 2016. More probably then Mr Hawkins is in a fight to avoid humiliation. Even getting on the ballot in many states which Greens usually manage is proving difficult. The problem is getting signatures (and the tightening of some requirements). The party’s presidential candidate is eligible to stand in just 21 states so far. Mr Hawkins guesses 1.6m more signatures are needed to qualify in the remaining ones. The arrival of covid-19 makes that look almost impossible. On March 19th he suspended his effort to gather those signatures. As for disruption to campaigning because of the virus Mr Hawkins seems relaxed. He says he has 10000 books at home and an appetite to read as many of them as possible.
194,Relations between China and America are infected with coronavirus,,The Economist,-1,https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/03/26/relations-between-china-and-america-are-infected-with-coronavirus,FACED WITH the first great crisis of his presidency Donald Trump fell back on his go-to tactic: blame China. His decision in January to bar non-American visitors from the country appears to have been his only prompt action against the coronavirus. After that failed to prevent it penetrating America’s borders he has been insisting on China’s responsibility for the pathogen.While the disease was concentrated in China Mr Trump called it by its approved name coronavirus. Since its arrival in America he has referred to it in daily tweets and briefings as the “China virus”. Others in his administration use “Wuhan virus” including Mike Pompeo the secretary of state. He is reported to have demanded the G7 group of industrial countries call it by that name. A White House staffer is said to prefer the phrase “kung flu”.It is easy to see what Mr Trump is about. He wants to distract from his administration’s failure to contain the disease—such that America despite having had months to prepare for it will soon have more covid-19 cases than China. He also sees in the issue an opportunity to own the libs. A note circulated by Mr Trump’s re-election campaign last week suggests that it plans to make the president’s fearlessness in uttering the phrase “China virus” a defining difference between him and his presumed Democratic opponent Joe Biden. In 2016 Mr Trump portrayed Hillary Clinton’s aversion to the unhelpful phrase “radical Islamic terrorism” as weak; he has updated the tactic.Yet what candidate Mr Trump said in 2016 and what America’s president says are different matters. China has responded angrily to his administration’s slurs. Where recent pandemics—including the 2014 west African Ebola outbreak—saw productive Sino-American co-operation this one has taken the already-poor relations between Mr Trump and Xi Jinping to new lows.And they are liable to worsen despite efforts on both sides to rein in the rhetoric this week. Mr Trump appears set on a campaign of China-baiting which America’s looming recession and death toll will make more feverish especially as the virus spreads to Republican-voting states. China-watchers warn of a rising risk of a “low probability high consequence” upset. In the best case one opines the relationship with China will be “utterly broken”.The best way to lower the tension would be if Mr Trump’s diversionary tactic failed. But this would require his supporters to denounce his handling of the virus of which there is currently no sign. Republicans admire it. And even if their faith wobbled Mr Trump’s China-bashing would be likelier to sustain his popularity on the right than to endanger it.This reflects more than Republicans’ traditional hawkishness. Bashing China unites two of the Republicans’ main factions: national-security sorts who dislike Mr Trump’s protectionism but like his belligerence and economic populists who are wary of militarism but love the tariffs. By extension it is also one of the ways the Republican establishment which dominates the former group has made peace with Mr Trump. No wonder ambitious Republicans who try to keep a foot in both camps sound especially hawkish. They include Mr Pompeo who calls China’s ruling party “the central threat of our times”.Discernible too amid the Republican mistrust of China is a fear of national decline that looks like an accompaniment to white conservatives’ dread of the socio-demographic currents that threaten the party. In a tweet this week Newt Gingrich a Trump loyalist and former presidential candidate lamented that Huawei a Chinese telecoms firm emblematic of state capitalism was dispensing medical supplies while “our once great telecommunications companies have lost their entrepreneurial drive.”This helps explain why Republicans find it easy to ignore the obvious expediency of Mr Trump’s latest China-bashing. It also explains why few appear to have registered that his antagonistic China policy has not achieved much. His tariffs have been ruinous to American farmers and consumers and won no big concessions from China on any of the issues such as intellectual-property theft they were supposed to address. The need to confront China has been embraced by many Republicans as an ideological imperative requiring no supporting evidence of its wisdom.And yet the pandemic also points to other ways in which Mr Trump’s policy has backfired. In line with its general disregard for science and civilian expertise the administration slashed the Centres for Disease Control’s China-based staff—the potential focal point for Sino-American pandemic co-operation—ahead of the outbreak. Instead of rallying its allies in a global response to the pandemic it has continued to alienate them. Mr Trump gave the Europeans no forewarning of his plan to bar non-American visitors from their countries this month. Instead of rising above China’s propagandists he got into the mud with them.Sino’ the timesEarlier this month Mr Trump was lambasted for having allegedly tried to buy a promising German coronavirus vaccine for America’s exclusive use. He would do better to reignite the liberal values and openness to talent upon which America’s economic dynamism is based. Last week Propublica a news website described how a Chinese scientist Weihong Tan was hounded from the University of Florida last year by federal restrictions on scientists with ties to China. Now at Hunan University he switched from cancer research and created a faster test for covid-19. And Mr Trump’s recent rhetoric which has helped inspire a surge in hate crimes against Asian-Americans cannot have tempted him to return.Mr Trump’s effort to redefine relations with China as fundamentally competitive may prove to be his most enduring legacy. Contrary to his politicking even Democrats now see the relationship in those terms. His management of it as the pandemic highlights is a different story: it shows how America can lose.
195,Coronavirus disruption risks damaging the 2020 United States census,,The Economist,-1,https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/03/21/coronavirus-disruption-risks-damaging-the-2020-united-states-census,WHEN THE 2020 United States census scheduled for April 1st was planned the areas of most concern were mapped. They include places like Deep East Texas an area of 10000 square miles north-east of Houston with a population of roughly 385000 people. “We are a totally rural region” says Lonnie Hunt the director of the Deep East Texas Council of Governments (DETCOG) an intergovernmental agency. “We have economically distressed people rural people senior citizens minorities—we check box after box after box.” In large parts of the region most people do not have internet access. Many live in places only accessible with four-wheel drives.Counting everybody in Deep East Texas was never going to be easy. Now it looks like it may be near impossible. “The coronavirus has certainly complicated matters” says Mr Hunt. To help ensure an accurate count DETCOG had hired a dozen census co-ordinators to go out to community events—sports matches church services school sports days—with information to persuade people to send their returns in and internet hotspots and iPads with which to do it on the spot. Most of those events are now being cancelled. With people staying indoors they probably will not encounter any of the workers meant to explain to them the importance of the census and get them to fill it in.The virus may represent the biggest threat to the United States census in its 230-year history. Mandated by the constitution it is the world’s most expensive and among the world’s oldest consistent data-gathering operations. The results determine how many congressional seats and electoral-college votes are allocated to each state and where those districts are. Roughly $1.5trn of federal money each year is spent according to data derived at least in part from census returns. It is not just the government that uses it. Firms use it to decide where to build supermarkets target advertising or open factories. “Every nook and cranny of the private economy relies on census data” says Andrew Reamer of George Washington University.It is also a huge operation involving hundreds of thousands of workers travelling across the country knocking on doors. In 2010 a quarter of Americans were counted by workers in person. It is not only the door-knocking which begins on May 13th that may be threatened by the need for people to self-isolate. The televised sports events that advertising would have targeted such as the March Madness college basketball games are all being cancelled.Even before the outbreak of the virus this year’s census was raising concerns. The census is meant to record every single person in America on the day it is held. But this year President Donald Trump’s government wanted to add a question to the census about citizenship. The question was struck down by the Supreme Court. But Nestor Lopez an official from Hidalgo County along the Texas-Mexico border says he worries many people especially undocumented immigrants still fear information gathered could be used against them. People “do not want to be answering anything from the federal government” he says. In fact personally identifiable data from the census cannot be revealed for 72 years even to other government agencies. But most people do not know that. And now they may never hear otherwise.So far the Census Bureau has only made modest changes. On March 18th the agency announced that all field operations are to be suspended until April 1st. On other surveys officials will make phone calls instead of visits. It has asked administrators of “group quarters”—institutions like nursing homes prisons and college dormitories—to “choose a way to count their residents that requires less in-person contact”. But more radical adjustments may be needed. Terri Ann Lowenthal a former director of the House committee that oversees the census notes that the count takes ten years to plan and “yet now the Census Bureau is being forced to make shifts basically on the fly”. On March 17th Brazil announced it would delay its census by a year. American officials might have to consider that too.
196,Covid-19 is exposing America’s resilience—and vulnerability,,The Economist,-1,https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/03/21/covid-19-is-exposing-americas-resilience-and-vulnerability,Governors mayors and sheriffs will not let a hopeless president stop them from doing what they need to doIT IS HARD to pick the best illustration of the administration’s failings on covid-19. There have been so many.Having been in the crowd to hear Donald Trump dismiss the virus as the Democrats’ “new hoax” three weeks ago Lexington is still grappling with the president’s denialism. The predictable result surveys this week suggest is that Republican voters are much less likely than Democrats to consider the virus dangerous or to take any measure to avoid contracting it. Given that they also tend to be older this threatens to bring a dramatic new meaning to the hoary trope about Republicans voting against their own interests.Yet the problems extend beyond the president’s rhetoric. John Bolton’s decision to scrap the NSC’s dedicated pandemic unit is another contender. So is the Centres for Disease Control sticking with a faulty viral test when the WHO could have provided a working alternative; also the turf wars among the White House’s cast of suck-ups and cronies; and Mr Trump’s latest xenophobic attack on China. It is a stunning catalogue of failure.And its effects could be profound. The Iraq war and financial crisis fuelled a wave of mistrust in government that helped elect Mr Trump. The viral plague may end up deadlier than the war and costlier than them both. Even cool heads are sounding the alarm. In the Atlantic Anne Appelbaum foresees a devastating national epiphany—a moment when the country “long accustomed to thinking of itself as the best most efficient and most technically advanced society in the world is about to be proved an unclothed emperor.” In the Financial Times another veteran of this newspaper Gideon Rachman suggests America’s failure on covid-19 and China’s perceived success could do dreadful damage to democracy.These are plausible scenarios. The virus is descending on a country already gripped by pessimism. In “A Time To Build” the conservative thinker Yuval Levin discerns a “twilight age” of national frustration and joylessness which he ascribes to a part-justified morally sapping loss of trust in institutions. In another new book “Why We’re Polarised” Ezra Klein describes the corrosive role that racially infused partisanship plays in that. He also holds out little hope of it or the political dysfunction it causes receding because of the electoral advantages the Republicans’ lily-white minority will continue to enjoy even as it shrinks. By 2045 whites are expected to be a minority but thanks to West Virginia Wyoming and the other small mostly white states the withered hand of Mitch McConnell could in theory still control the Senate.Such imposing problems will probably ensure that America’s adjustment to greater diversity at home and multipolarity abroad will continue to be rocky. But they need not lead to the head-on collision pessimists fear. America’s fortunes have hardly ever been smooth (notwithstanding as Mr Levin has previously described rival forms of liberal and conservative nostalgia for an imagined mid-20th-century golden age). And the country’s traditional sources of resilience are still apparent—even in the current crisis.One strength is the flipside of the bureaucratic havoc and buck-passing that the pandemic has triggered. It is a decentralised and fragmented democratic system that responds much better to local than national trials. The federal government defers to the states as a matter of course on public health policing and emergency response. In the event of a major crisis this is a recipe for chaos which is why the quality of the president matters so much as George W. Bush showed in the bungled aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and Mr Trump is showing more grievously. Only he has the bully pulpit and powers required to cut through the institutional rivalries bottlenecks and excessive legalisms that Americans have intentionally put in the way of central authority.Yet each cascading layer of American governance offers a partial fix from governors—many of whom are now battling to fill the void led by Mike DeWine of Ohio and Andrew Cuomo of New York —to hospital boards and sheriffs. And though the main strengths of this diffuse system—local sensitivity and experimentation—may now be of secondary importance their time will soon come.Meanwhile the crisis is underlining how asymmetric Americans’ pessimism and mistrust of the mainstream is. While Jerry Falwell junior was informing Fox News viewers last week that covid-19 was designed by North Korea to hurt Mr Trump mainstream media organs universities other centre-left entities and both the main Democratic presidential contenders were preaching social distancing. In 2009 Mr Obama’s $830bn stimulus limped out of the House of Representatives without one Republican backer; the House Democratic majority is about to grant Mr Trump’s wish for even bigger measures. Democrats unlike many Republicans still believe in expertise objective truth and good government. And the fact that many blame this disaster on Mr Trump who represents none of those things suggests it will not shake their trust in them. Indeed they are about to nominate for president one of America’s most upbeat undogmatic politicians. Even before considering the merits of Joe Biden’s policies this is a basis for optimism.Health tips from HannityEver since Mr Trump’s election many have asked whether he could rally the country against a major threat. The worst of their fears seem to be justified. Yet for another tentative solace there is still some rallying afoot. Fox has abruptly switched from offering conspiracy theories to public-health advice. It knows things have got serious. The pragmatism of many Republican lawmakers—including Mitt Romney an early advocate of individual cash transfers—is also encouraging. Congress is about to raise its game dramatically.The functional moment will pass whenever the crisis recedes leaving who knows what devastation in its wake. But amid that uncertainty here is another silver lining. It seems increasingly possible that in eight months’ time voters will appraise Mr Trump on a substantial new issue: his competence to be president
197,American life has been transformed in a few short weeks,,The Economist,-1,https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/03/19/american-life-has-been-transformed-in-a-few-short-weeks,THE TITULAR conceit of “28 Days Later” as with many contagion-style horror films is of a man waking up after a month-long coma only to find society upended by a rampaging virus. Many Americans are experiencing something similar. On March 3rd there were just 122 confirmed cases of covid-19—the disease currently sweeping the world—and only seven deaths. By March 17th there were 7786 confirmed cases (even these were a sure underestimate given the dearth of testing) and 118 deaths. Twenty-eight days later on March 31st what might America look like?“We don’t know whether we’re going to look like Italy or the provinces outside Hubei” in China where the spread of covid-19 was fairly effectively contained says David Blumenthal president of the Commonwealth Fund a health-policy think-tank. “But the likelihood is—given the slowness with which we responded to the epidemic—that we look more like Italy” he adds. Jerome Adams the surgeon-general has warned of the same.Can America’s health system cope? The structural problems that make pandemic response more difficult—lack of paid sick pay a large uninsured population and a significant number of insured people nonetheless worried about out-of-pocket medical bills—cannot be mended overnight. Instead public-health experts and doctors are increasingly worried about sheer capacity constraints. In China 5% of those diagnosed needed intensive care. There are roughly 97000 beds in intensive care units (ICUs) of which one-third are empty. Though America has relatively few total hospital beds per person compared with other countries it ranks among the highest for ICU beds per person with nearly three times as many as Italy.“The real limiting factors are likely to be the ventilators or the staff” says Greg Martin a professor of medicine at Emory University and president-elect of the Society of Critical Care Medicine. There are roughly 50000 physicians trained in critical care and 34000 similarly specialised nurses and assistants. This could be insufficient in the face of hundreds of thousands of cases at peak rates of infection.Then there is the problem of kit. In China half of those in critical care required the use of ventilators machines that help people breathe. There are thought to be 62000 full-featured mechanical ventilators in the country many of which are already in use (see article). Older stocks of perhaps 100000 devices—including CPAP machines used for those with sleep apnea—could be called upon if needed but would provide only basic functions. Ramp-ups in ventilator production are being pondered including through emergency powers given to the president under the Defence Production Act of 1950 but there has been little actual action yet. On a phone call with state governors President Donald Trump urged “respirators ventilators all of the equipment—try getting it yourselves” which could spark an unhelpful competition between states for scarce resources.“Under almost any basic scenario things look tough. Hospital beds will be completely full many times over if we don’t substantially spread the load” warns Ashish Jha director of the Global Health Institute at Harvard. To head that off Mr Jha has called for an Italy-style national quarantine lasting for at least two weeks in which all non-essential businesses are closed and gatherings of more than five people are barred to give time for testing to become widespread. After a dismally slow start to testing the numbers are finally heading up—although the best estimates come not from public-health agencies but volunteer trackers using a Google sheet—to an estimated 12535 tests conducted on March 17th. Given the expected scope of the disease and the reported obstacles to people with symptoms actually getting tested much more will be needed.Most hospitals are making contingency plans. There are plans to add physical beds by cancelling elective surgeries that can be postponed converting recovery rooms into added beds and building tents to house some patients. The Cleveland Clinic a prominent hospital says it has plans in place to add 1000 beds of capacity within 72 hours if needed. Teams of doctors and nurses with other specialities could be conscripted into critical-care work supervised by critical-care doctors who handle the trickiest cases—like respiratory distress coupled with organ failure in the kidneys or heart. If this is insufficient recently retired doctors could be drafted into service. Some teaching hospitals are using simulation centres to prepare medical staff for the inevitable surge in cases.Testing? Testing?Whether it will come to all this is still unclear. Testing capacity remains constrained limiting the information epidemiologists have to feed both their models and their willingness to speculate. Their policy recommendations—social distancing closure of schools and large gatherings—are nevertheless clear. One team of researchers has concluded that an epidemic resembling that of Wuhan where the novel coronavirus first broke out would overwhelm hospitals many times over while one resembling Guangzhou a city that locked down in the early days of the virus could be dealt with.On March 16th however a team of scientists based at Imperial College London who have been advising the British government also published forecasts of the epidemic’s trajectory in America. As with Britain the figures look grim. Without any mitigation America would experience 2.2m deaths they predict (see Briefing). Even in the case of some mitigation—isolation of the sick social distancing for the elderly but an otherwise normal society—American hospital and ICU capacity would be exceeded eight times over and the country would be on track for at least 1.1m deaths. Averting this through “suppression”—isolation of sick closing of schools and universities social distancing for everyone—would require months until therapeutics or vaccines can be developed.America is therefore turning towards suppression of the virus. Millions of pupils and university students have been sent home and left to take classes online. Mr Trump has advised that people not congregate in gatherings of more than ten people. San Francisco and surrounding counties have issued a “shelter-in-place” order that requires 7m to remain in their homes unless necessary. New York City is expected to do the same for its 8m residents. In 22 states bars and restaurants have been ordered to close their seating and only serve takeaway. The state of New York is setting up drive-through testing centres starting in New Rochelle a commuter town in Westchester County that was one of the early sites of a covid-19 cluster and is urging federal troops to build emergency temporary hospital facilities. New Rochelle’s mayor says he is surviving the lockdown there on “adrenalin coffee and M&Ms”.The goal is to increase general hospital capacity by a factor of two and ICU capacity by a factor of ten within two months. Elections have been postponed in a few states for the Democratic primary which now seems a dull distant affair. America’s devolved system means that the shuttering will happen at different rates in different places but the trajectory is clear. “You want a single national response. But when the federal government completely fails as it has so far then you can get states and cities to step up” says Mr Jha.The question is how long this can go on for. Unmitigated the epidemic would not peak for at least another three months. Suppression can reduce the spread of the disease as China’s experiment with locking down most of its population showed but relaxing these measures will inevitably bring another surge in cases. Mr Trump who a few weeks ago was suggesting the virus was the latest hoax invented to damage him is now warning that this could be the start of a months-long reorientation in American life. And while these extraordinary actions should smother the disease they will also smother the economy.The dismal economic forecasts will require further action from Congress. It spent the last week haggling over a bill that would make testing for the disease free increase the flow of safety-net benefits and grant paid sick leave to more workers (though this provision appears to be hollowing out with every iteration). Even before that bill was finalised Washington’s attention had already turned to the even bigger economic stimulus package that must come next. Senators both Democrats and Republicans are tripping over themselves issuing plans to send cash directly to American families.The total package which could be worth $1trn or more dwarfs the $100bn-or-so bill recently signed into law and every other stimulus package in history. The Trump administration has proposed sending $500bn in direct cash to taxpayers $300bn to keep firms afloat and $200bn to bail out critical industries like airlines. The typical partisan bickering from Congress and even from Mr Trump has been muted. Every politician seems to now realise that the country faces an unprecedented crisis first of public health and then of the economy that will last for months. Whether this action will look sufficient 28 days later is as with seemingly every aspect of the covid-19 pandemic deeply uncertain.
198,Joe Biden builds an insurmountable lead,,The Economist,-1,https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/03/19/joe-biden-builds-an-insurmountable-lead,MAGNANIMITY IS A winner’s privilege and the speech that Joe Biden delivered on March 17th was amply magnanimous. He told supporters of Bernie Sanders whom he defeated in all three states voting that night that he and his rival “may disagree on tactics but we share a common vision”. Standing alone in his Delaware home behind a podium (a necessary piece of furniture for a candidate working from home) he praised first responders and poll-workers consoled the bereaved and sounded more like a wartime president than a candidate. His victory in the primary is now all but assured. But what campaigning and voting will look like during the pandemic is anything but.The most striking aspect of Mr Biden’s victory was its breadth. Arizona Florida and Illinois collectively have 184 counties. Bernie Sanders won three of them none by more than five points. He hoped that Latinos would buoy him in Florida but lost the state by nearly 40 points. This may partly have been because of the weight of Cuban-Americans: Mr Sanders—in an act either of admirable principle or political lunacy—has repeatedly praised the accomplishments of the Castro regime. The picture was different in Arizona which Mr Sanders lost by just 12 points. A greater proportion of Latinos there are Mexican and many are recent arrivals; these groups tend to be more left-wing than Hispanics in Florida. And Arizona has a bigger Hispanic population than Florida: 30% of its residents are Latinos versus 23% in Florida.Mr Sanders’s supporters who have visions of turning Texas and Arizona Democratic point to his strength with Latinos as a reason he should lead the party. The results on March 17th show that such thinking is flawed. There are more competitive electoral-college votes at stake in Florida where Mr Sanders is much less popular. Such assertions also ignore general-election polls which show Mr Biden beating Mr Trump in Arizona but Mr Sanders losing. Besides Mr Biden’s delegate lead now appears insurmountable. To win the nomination Mr Sanders would need to win 64% of the remaining delegates. He is polling nationally at just 36%.The Illinois primary which Mr Biden won by 23 points was marked by low turnout. Chicago election officials said at least 10% of 8500 election judges—volunteers who oversee polling booths—had dropped out fearful of viral contagion. Polling stations in Chicago had more bottles of hand sanitiser than walk-in voters. An official at one north-side site likened the dour public mood to the “start of world war two”.Ohio which Mr Sanders probably would have lost badly was due to vote on March 17th but the night before postponed its primary until June. Mike DeWine the state’s Republican governor said that people “mustn’t be forced to choose between their health and exercising their constitutional rights.” The state’s Supreme Court backed him in a pre-dawn ruling on polling day leaving some voters rattling locked doors at polling stations as the sun rose.Georgia and Louisiana also Biden-friendly states due to vote in the coming weeks pushed back their primaries too. Puerto Rico due to vote on March 29th looks likely to do the same (Maryland and Kentucky also delayed theirs). That would leave Alaska Hawaii and Wyoming—all of which Mr Sanders could plausibly win—as the next states to vote allowing the senator to spin a tale of comeback against the odds. Given how strong Mr Biden’s position is though few would believe it.For some the decisions to postpone voting whatever their public-health merits raised the spectre of Donald Trump doing something similar in November. He cannot cancel an election—that takes an act of Congress—or change the inauguration date which is in the constitution. But a president could conceivably order polling places closed for public-health reasons or take similar measures to depress turnout or discourage voting.Tom Perez who heads the Democratic National Committee has urged states against peremptorily rescheduling primaries and has instead asked them to adopt measures such as expanded absentee and postal voting as well as longer voting hours which would lessen the need to gather in crowds. Congress has also begun mulling how to conduct elections during a pandemic: Ron Wyden and Amy Klobuchar two Democratic senators introduced legislation on March 16th to make early in-person voting and voting by mail available everywhere (currently just 34 states let all voters have absentee or mail-in ballots).However people ultimately vote the campaign will be a much quieter affair for the next few months: no big rallies debates before live audiences or working rope lines. That will no doubt annoy Mr Sanders who is at his best exhorting large crowds. So is Mr Trump. If America remains locked down into autumn he faces the prospect of either running for president without his trademark rallies or asking his supporters to ignore the risks and gather anyway.
199,Spluttering Tracking the economic impact of covid-19 in real time,,The Economist,-1,https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/03/14/tracking-the-economic-impact-of-covid-19-in-real-time,AS FEARS GROW about the impact of the covid-19 virus financial markets have slumped. Now there are signs that the virus is moving from traders’ screens to the real economy. No one will know the true economic impact for some time because official statistics are published with a lag: the first estimate of GDP growth in the current quarter for instance will not appear until April 29th. Analysts cannot wait that long. So they are turning to “real-time” data mainly produced by the private sector on everything from transport use to social-media activity. None of these measures is reliable by itself but together they give a decent impression of what is going on.It is not all doom and gloom. So far there are few indications—either from weekly jobless claims or from company announcements—that joblessness is rising. Worries that broken supply chains would stoke inflation also look overdone for now at least. Data to the beginning of March from State Street PriceStats Indicators which measures inflation daily suggest that inflation has been on a steady downward trend since the beginning of the year (though in recent days food prices have inched up perhaps pointing to the effects of stockpiling). Railway and trucking volumes appear to be holding up. There is some evidence of lower electricity demand perhaps as people miss work though the figures are volatile.Household spending is taking a big hit however. Analysis by Goldman Sachs a bank of Twitter posts suggests that consumer confidence has dropped. People are nervous of crowds—and some 40% of household spending is vulnerable to people shunning gatherings according to calculations by The Economist using a methodology from an Oxford University research paper. (About 5% of consumer spending goes on dining out for instance.)Google searches for “restaurant reservations” are way down. The maître d’ at San Francisco’s best oyster bar was so pleased to see a customer that he offered a free plate of them when your correspondent bought a drink (the bar looked over the bay towards Grand Princess a virus-stricken ship harboured in Oakland). A report from JPMorgan Chase another bank estimates that last weekend the virus reduced cinema-ticket receipts by 20%. Attendance at Broadway shows has also dropped. Data from TomTom a location-technology firm reveal unusually low traffic congestion in many American cities since the end of last week. Lower consumer spending points to feeble GDP growth in the first half of this year though a recession still seems unlikely at this stage.What happens next depends on whether America gets a handle on the outbreak. If it does not then over time revenue-starved firms and salary-starved families will struggle. Any short-term economic boost from stockpiling would be cold comfort in the face of lower spending on services. But if America contains the virus it can look forward to a bounceback of sorts. Real-time data in China from traffic congestion to energy consumption remain weak but are fast improving as the number of new infections slows. An acute economic shock does not have to turn chronic.
200,Lexington The Trump campaign,,The Economist,-1,https://www.economist.com/united-states/2020/03/14/the-trump-campaign,FIRST IT WAS Steve Bannon; then Jared Kushner; now it is Brad Parscale. Ever since Donald Trump began persuading millions of Americans to support him while behaving as no successful politician ever had mainstream commentators have looked for the evil genius pulling his strings. Messrs Bannon and Kushner were both auditioned for the part but rejected after achieving little in office besides notoriety. Now as Mr Trump’s re-election campaign starts going full tilt Mr Parscale is being considered.Tremulous profiles of the Trump campaign’s manager are the latest thing in political reporting. They typically start by noting his intimidating height bullish demeanour and “Viking beard” (“I get the Viking thing often” Mr Parscale has acknowledged). Such attributes are on-brand with a president fixated on central casting—as are other features of the 44-year-old Mr Parscale’s rise from obscurity in San Antonio Texas where he worked as an online marketer to command the heights of the politics business.Like Mr Trump—who launched Mr Parscale by paying him $1500 to design his first campaign website—he is a political gadfly rabble-rouser and dissembler. A sometime libertarian who has rarely voted he is now a staple warm-up act at Trump rallies: praising the president and attacking his enemies. A self-described “farm boy from Kansas” he in fact grew up in suburbia the son of a wannabe Democratic politician. But again like Mr Trump he has a reputation for native cunning and outlandish success that can make such foibles seem colourfully additive or irrelevant.Mr Pascale’s reputation is based on Mr Trump’s 2016 digital campaign which he led. A Facebook executive described it as “the single best digital ad campaign I’ve ever seen”. Heavily focused on Facebook advertising it was credited with micro-targeting thousands of Trump voters in swing states with the half-truths and xenophobic messaging that Mr Parscale has a gift for turning from Mr Trump’s lips into ad copy. And sometimes the other way round: he is also credited with persuading the president to swap “illegal immigrants” for “illegal aliens” a more stimulating phrase.The liberal commentariat fears Mr Parscale is about to repeat his electoral feat. Mr Trump’s campaign is now awash with cash and even more ambitiously digitised than it was in 2016. It also stands to benefit disproportionately from his incumbency because digital campaigning is based on data-gathering which he has been doing non-stop. Perhaps a million people have attended the hundred-odd rallies he has held since his election and many more provided their names and phone numbers to register for one. At a rally in South Carolina last month one attendee with phone in hand showed your columnist what happens next.Every few hours she had received a text message purportedly from one of Mr Trump’s sons demanding cash. “My father asked me to reach out personally friend…Don’t disappoint him” ran the latest from Eric Trump. By such means Mr Trump and his proxies have raised over $200m far more than their Democratic rivals.That sort of money buys impunity as well as advertising. Though Facebook has tried to impose a code of conduct on political advertisers—for example it vowed to block content ruled untrue by a third-party fact-checker—the Trump campaign has often violated its terms. And in response the platform has backed down; for example although the campaign recently pushed a lie linking Joe Biden to corruption in Ukraine Facebook decided to make political campaigns exempt from its fact-checking rule.This is a promise of yet more disinformation and divisiveness. Yet whether Mr Parscale’s digital knavery will affect Mr Trump’s chances of re-election is moot. Academic studies of political advertising suggest it reinforces existing biases but is almost useless at changing voters’ minds. Americans’ partisan affiliations and familiarity with advertising are too strong. “The best estimate of the effects of campaign contact and advertising on Americans’ candidate choices in general elections is zero” concluded the authors of a recent meta-study of electoral research. Mike Bloomberg spent half a billion dollars proving the same point in a primary contest. It bought him some decent poll numbers but the moment he faced critical coverage after a bad debate performance they collapsed.Digital campaigning is fast-evolving. But notwithstanding the fears he is inspiring there is little reason to think Mr Parscale has anything up his sleeve that could alter this reassuring picture. His main ploy in 2016 was to use Facebook technology to raise money according to David Karpf of George Washington University an expert on disinformation. Mr Parscale was told how to do so by Facebook staffers loaned to the campaign. Otherwise the Trump campaign’s digital strategy was not fundamentally different from Hillary Clinton’s. Her campaign also spent heavily on Facebook.The mystique surrounding Mr Parscale and his digital arts appears to be largely a product of vested interests. Political operatives revere ads in part because many have got rich on them including Mr Parscale. One of his many firms has charged the Trump campaign and related organisations nearly $35m since 2017 mostly to pay for ads it has commissioned. This has also given Facebook the main beneficiary of Mr Parscale’s strategy an obvious incentive to talk up his genius and the potency of digital advertising—though there is no compelling evidence for either claim.Look at the dataJournalists who covered the 2016 election also have reasons to buy the myth of Mr Trump’s digital mastery. It allows them to downplay their own responsibility for his win by providing blanket coverage of the Republican candidate and the many slanders he levelled at Mrs Clinton concerning her emails alleged corruption and so forth. It is also a means to avoid confronting the uncomfortable fact that 63m Americans heard who Mr Trump was from his own mouth unfiltered and still voted for him. That is a better explanation for his success than Mr Parscale’s dark arts.

202,State Department to waive interviews for foreign farmworker visas in response to coronavirus,Adam Shaw,Fox News,1,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/state-dept-foreign-farm-worker-visas-coronavirus,Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.The State Department announced Friday that it is waiving the interview requirement for most agricultural guest worker visas in response to the coronavirus crisis -- a move that brought criticism from immigration hawks.“Secretary Pompeo in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security has authorized consular officers to expand the categories of H-2 visa applicants whose applications can be adjusted without an in-person interview” the agency said in a statement.DOJ POSTPONES 'REMAIN IN MEXICO' HEARINGS IN RESPONSE TO CORONAVIRUS THREATThe H-2 program allows temporary guest workers in the agricultural industry (H-2A) and in seasonal non-agricultural work (H-2B) to come to the U.S. But there has been a particular focus on the H-2A program recently due to questions about the food supply in a time of the coronavirus crisis.Officials can now waive the visa interview requirement one of the most daunting aspects of any visa application for a potential immigrant for H-2 applicants if they do not have any apparent or potential ineligibility. The new guidelines also increase the period in which returning workers can qualify for a waiver.The agency had suspended visa services at embassies and consulates last week but this week called the H-2 program “essential to the economy and food security of the United States and...a national security priority” said it would be processing H-2 cases “as much as possible.”Supporters say such visas are vital for the U.S. economy in times of surges in need but opponents say they are rife with abuse and incentivize companies to use cheap labor instead of updating their technology or raising wages to attract American workers.Sen. Dianne Feinstein D-Calif. had written to Pompeo this week urging him to take action on H-2A visas.“The ability to harvest food is critical to our nation’s food security particularly during a national emergency” Feinstein said in a letter. “I ask that you consider the food security needs of our nation and take every precaution necessary to protect public health during the coronavirus pandemic. Interrupting the issuance of H-2A agricultural visas – particularly for returning workers who have no inadmissibility concern – harms our national interests and may cause an interruption to our food supply in the midst of a global pandemic.”A coalition of agricultural groups had also urged Pompeo to prioritize the visas arguing that action was needed in order to keep the food supply chain intact.“The failure to take necessary action to protect our food supply will result in bare shelves in grocery store produce aisles not from panic buying but as the result of the federal government directly causing a shortage of critical labor” a letter from the Agriculture Workforce Coalition said.As a result of the interview waiver the State Department said it anticipates that “the vast majority of otherwise qualified H-2 applicants will now be adjudicated without an interview.”Groups who push for lower levels of migration overall oppose the move pointing in particular to the spike in unemployment that the crisis has caused -- which they say makes more immigration unnecessary when millions of Americans are looking for work.“This crisis has shown that we must move away from reliance on foreign workers in the agriculture industry and move into the 21st century. The Trump administration could have used the coronavirus bill to address food security issues through mechanization grants and no interest loans” RJ Hauman head of government relations at Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) told Fox News.“Instead they bought into the agriculture lobby’s pathetic despicable plea – that a country of over 320 million people on the cusp of record unemployment can’t get its own food harvested without cheap foreign labor” he said.The easing up of H-2 visas is in contrast to a number of other moves by the administration that restricted migration and travel into the U.S.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThe administration has largely banned travel from China Iran and Europe into the U.S. in response to the crisis. It has also restricted travel across land borders with Canada and Mexico to essential travel only.This week the Justice Department announced it was suspending hearings for migrants enrolled in the Migrant Protection Protocols at the southern border.

205,China accuses US of ‘malicious fabrication’ over efforts at UN to state coronavirus originated in Wuhan, Adam Shaw Ben Evansky ,Fox News,1,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/china-us-un-coronavirus,"The Chinese government is accusing the United States of engaging in “malicious fabrication” over its efforts to get the U.N. Security Council to state explicitly that the coronavirus pandemic began in Wuhan China -- part of an escalating battle between the two countries on the matter.NBC News first reported Thursday that talks at the council over a joint declaration or resolution on the global pandemic have stalled over the U.S. demand that it explicitly name Wuhan as the source of the virus.A source with knowledge of the situation confirmed to Fox News that the U.S. suggested language that would name Wuhan China and that the Chinese were unhappy about the push.“All members of the Security Council must recognize the threat that China’s mishandling of the outbreak poses to international peace and security” a State Department official later told Fox News. “The People’s Republic of China has been more interested in saving face than saving lives.”The Chinese Mission to the U.N. when asked by Fox News about the effort said on Thursday that it was “astonished by the choice of the United States to use whatever venue and opportunity for politicizing the COVID-19 and blaming China which we strongly oppose.”“The groundless accusations and malicious fabrication from the United States aim at shirking its own responsibilities which severely poisoned the atmosphere of the global cooperation in containing the outbreak” a spokesperson said. “We strongly urge the United States to stop such irresponsible practices and listen to the voice of the American people. The United States should indeed shoulder its responsibilities to save lives instead of going further down the wrong path.”The U.S. State Department official said on Thursday that the U.S. backs a resolution that would praise first responders and medical personnel and reinforce the importance of international cooperation as well as the need for all member states to act quickly and with full transparency to end the pandemic. It would also back a resolution that demands a pause to all hostilities to enable the international community to quickly tackle the spread of the virus.But the official also noted that since the virus broke in China Beijing has a “special responsibility” to be fully transparent about the virus: “Instead they suppressed information and punished doctors and journalists who raised the alarm.”“We call on PRC authorities to provide accurate and prompt public health reporting timely access to all relevant information and respect for freedom of expression so that lessons learned best practices and innovations can be shared freely between peoples to facilitate the most globally effective response to minimize deaths” the official said.President Trump has repeatedly named the coronavirus “the Chinese virus” and has blamed the Chinese for its “secretive” approach in the early days of the crisis. That was after Chinese officials began dabbling in conspiracy theories that the U.S. Army was the cause of the virus.Donald J. Trump✔@realDonaldTrumpJust finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China. Discussed in great detail the CoronaVirus that is ravaging large parts of our Planet.

The body under its rules can pass legislation by unanimous consent – with no representative in the chamber objecting – or a voice vote — an exercise in which those for and against a bill yell yea or nay and the loudest side wins.But either method can be shut down by a ""point of order"" from a member who could argue a lack of quorum meaning less than half of the House's total members are present in the chamber. At that point it would need at least 216 total members present to hold a recorded vote.Massie has indicated to House leaders despite significant efforts from Republican leadership that he may force a recorded vote by suggesting the lack of quorum. House leadership is also concerned a handful of other members –Republicans and Democrats – might be considering taking the same action.Massie on Thursday night noted that the coronavirus bill with about $2 trillion of new spending and $4 trillion of stimulus via monetary policy from the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve equated to ""$60000 per family of new national debt and dollar devaluation in this stimulus.”He also said in an interview with 55 KRC radio Thursday morning that he was interested in following the letter of the Constitution rather than a workaround in the House's rules.""I'm having a really hard time with this. Because they're saying well it's hard to travel yadda yadda yadda"" Massie said. ""Well last night 96 out of 100 Senators voted. All we would need is 218 out of 435 to vote"" he added pointing to a section of Article I in the U.S. Constitution that states ""a majority of each [body of the legislature] shall constitute a quorum to do business.""Massie’s potential move has forced House members to return to D.C. in time for a Friday vote.

And it’s brought an end to campaign rallies and town halls forcing candidates and their campaigns to connect with voters online rather than in-person.""It's changing every day because elections are being delayed"" Sanders said when asked about how the reassessment of his campaign is faring. ""Where do we go from here with the elections that are being delayed where we can't go out and hold rallies or knock on doors? That's what we're looking at right now.”But Sanders doesn’t seem in any rush to suspend his campaign.While the senator has stopped criticizing Biden and is no longer fundraising for his White House bid he’s remained very active – holding virtual campaign events to discuss the coronavirus outbreak and raise funds to benefit the response to the pandemic.The Sanders campaign has also spotlighted how it's ramping up organizing efforts in New York ahead of that state’s primary – which for now is still scheduled to take place on April 28 – and in Pennsylvania which is moving its primary to June.And earlier this week Sanders aides told The New York Times that if there’s a Democratic presidential primary debate in April their candidate expects to participate. “If there is a debate in April he plans to be there” the Sanders campaign told Fox News.""I think the American people especially in this unprecedented moment in American history want to hear the ideas that will lead us away from where we are right now"" Sanders told NPR as he spotlighted his progressive proposals on the economy criminal justice reform and climate change.""These are enormously important issues and we need serious debates over them” added the independent senator who’s making his second straight bid for the Democratic nomination.Biden said he’s “had enough” of primary debates and that it’s time to “get on with this.”Asked on a conference call Wednesday with reporters if there should be another primary debate in April Biden said: “My focus is just dealing with this crisis right now. I haven’t thought about any more debates. I think we’ve had enough debates. I think we should get on with this.”The Democratic National Committee has yet to weigh in on whether an April debate will take place.An outside adviser who’s close to Sanders told Fox News: “I think for Bernie the presidential campaign has always been part of a larger movement and the ideals and the goals that the movement set for itself.”The adviser who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely emphasized that Sanders is now mapping out how to transition from a presidential campaign to a political movement.“I think he clearly sees the end of the road. It’s just a matter of how he transitions the campaign into his future work leading the movement"" the adviser said. ""It will continue and Bernie will be the leader.”"

Representative Dusty Johnson a Republican and the lone lawmaker representing South Dakota joined three colleagues from Minnesota who caught a virtually empty layover flight.And multiple members of the New York delegation defied recommendations that anyone who has passed through New York City quarantine for 14 days and traveled to Washington with hopes of ensuring passage of the $2 trillion economic stabilization package intended to bolster families and businesses during the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.House leaders in both parties had hoped to avoid such a rush to Washington with a plan to approve the largest aid package in American history on a voice vote. But at least one lawmaker Representative Thomas Massie Republican of Kentucky has voiced his opposition and said Friday morning that he would try to slow its passage by calling for a recorded vote prompting calls for rank-and-file lawmakers to return to Capitol Hill.“The Constitution requires that a quorum of members be present to conduct business in the House” Mr. Massie said on Twitter adding that “millions of essential working-class Americans are still required to go to work during this pandemic.”“Is it too much to ask that the House do its job just like the Senate did?"" Mr. Massie asked.Thomas Massie✔@RepThomasMassie(1/11)I swore an oath to uphold the constitution and I take that oath seriously.

Leaders settled on it so that lawmakers who wanted to speak could make their views known and those who were not physically present would not be required to record a vote.But technically the House cannot legislate without the presence of a quorum defined by the Constitution as a simple majority. (The House currently has 430 members; 216 are required for a quorum.) Because Mr. Massie plans to assert that the House lacks a quorum and call for a recorded vote the House will have to cease its business until 216 lawmakers arrive. (Mr. Massie has displayed a penchant for thwarting procedural maneuvers.)“Because of one member of Congress refusing to allow emergency action entire Congress must be called back to vote in House” Representative Peter King Republican of New York fumed on Twitter. “Risk of infection and risk of legislation being delayed. Disgraceful. Irresponsible.”Even President Trump registered his disapproval saying Mr. Massie should be jettisoned from the Republican Party for his defiance.“He just wants the publicity” Mr. Trump said on Twitter dismissing Mr. Massie as a “third rate Grandstander” for potentially delaying the passage of mammoth legislation he intends to sign. “He can’t stop it only delay which is both dangerous & costly. Workers & small businesses need money now in order to survive.”Lawmakers scrambled to drive through the night or board deserted flights — many of them red-eyes — though many had expressed a unwillingness to travel during a pandemic as much of the country has sheltered in place to slow the spread of the coronavirus. A handful of lawmakers are infected and dozens more are in isolation with others worried about potentially exposing their family members. It remained unclear Friday morning how many would be present for a possible vote but both parties worked to ensure that 216 lawmakers were present before the conclusion of debate Friday morning in order to have a swift vote.“Shameful” Representative Dean Phillips Democrat of Minnesota wrote on Twitter on Friday. “Your 428 colleagues take their oaths to the Constitution just as seriously. But unlike you they take the health of their colleagues Capitol staff families and communities seriously. Even @realDonaldTrump and I agree on that.”There is broad bipartisan consensus on the legislation which passed the Senate unanimously on Wednesday although Republicans and Democrats also agree it is by no means perfect. In his tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said Republicans “had to give up some stupid things in order to get the ‘big picture’ done.”Democrats have vowed to push for priorities that were left unaddressed in the mammoth package including stronger labor protections for workers. Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland the majority leader said they would work to correct language that treats the District of Columbia as a territory instead of a state slashing by more than half the funds it would otherwise have received.“The option that we have is to either let them suffer with nothing or to allow this greed and billions of dollars which will be leveraged into trillions of dollars to contribute to the largest income inequality gap in our future” said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Democrat of New York. “There should be shame about what was fought for in this bill and the choices that we have to make.”But as sense of urgency in the face of a national crisis prevailed prompting most lawmakers to offer their support. The three hours of debate split evenly between Republicans and Democrats and set to end about 12:30 p.m. grew fiery at moments as lawmakers sought to maintain a brisk pace of statements.Representative Haley Stevens a freshman Democrat from Michigan who drove through the night to reach the Capitol on Friday morning wore pink latex gloves in a nod to the risks faced by medical professionals. Ms. Stevens whose district on the outskirts of Detroit has been rocked by both the spread of the virus and a series of layoffs stemming from the economic slowdown was repeatedly ruled out of order after an emotional outburst in which she pleaded with colleagues to “take this disease seriously.”“I rise for every American who is scared right now!” Ms. Stevens shouted as the presiding officer Representative Anthony Brown Democrat of Maryland banged his gavel in a futile attempt to silence her. As other members shouted from the floor the congresswoman pressed on delivering an impassioned message to doctors and nurses: “You will see darkness! You will be pushed! And our society needs you to stand together at this time!”To help broadcast the voices of the lawmakers unable to join the debate in person C-Span the public cable television network that broadcasts from Capitol Hill is working with leaders in both parties to “dedicate airtime to House members’ brief video statements explaining their position” on the legislation likely in the coming days the organization said in a statement.“We have members on both sides of the aisle who have the virus” Representative Kevin McCarthy Republican of California and the minority leader told reporters on Thursday. “We have members who are quarantined. We have members who have challenges with their flights canceled. The floor will look different.”But many still returned to Washington making calculated decisions on how to minimize their risk. Representative Joe Courtney Democrat of Connecticut decided to drive on the advice of his wife Audrey a nurse practitioner.“The one thing she was insistent about was that she didn’t want me flying in a plane” Mr. Courtney said.So at 10:30 a.m. Thursday the couple left their home in Connecticut and got into their Ford Taurus with the congressman in the passenger seat conducting business — including a conference call with one of the governors of the Federal Reserve — while his wife drove. The roads were empty he said. They arrived in Washington six hours later.“There’s definitely some nervousness about whether or not there’s going to be a quorum call” Mr. Courtney said “and if I was home and missed that I would never forgive myself.”Those who do return will find a chamber in many ways transformed by the pandemic.In preparation for the arrival of lawmakers the microphones have been removed from the well of the House to guard against transmission of the coronavirus.

212,Scrubbing In to Vote the House Returns to Consider a $2 Trillion Stimulus Plan,Sheryl Gay Stolberg,The New York Times,-1,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/politics/coronavirus-house-voting.html,WASHINGTON — The microphones have been removed from the well of the House to guard against transmission of the coronavirus. Lawmakers who enter the chamber must clean their hands with sanitizer and enter through one door then scrub again and leave through another as if coming and going from an operating room. Once inside they must keep their distance and take turns voting in small groups.When members of the House return to Washington on Friday to approve a $2 trillion economic stimulus package and send it to President Trump they will enter a Capitol where every facet of life has been altered by a pandemic.For starters there will be fewer of them than usual. Many of the lawmakers are at home either because they are sick or in states mandating quarantine or because it would be difficult to travel. To accommodate them Speaker Nancy Pelosi and top Democratic leaders have planned for a voice vote — a plan that could fall through if there are procedural objections.Those who do show up will operate under a different set of rules laid out on Thursday by the sergeant-at-arms and the attending physician of the Capitol.Only lawmakers and those who have an office in the building will be allowed to enter meaning that staff members cannot accompany their bosses. If members want to speak on the House floor they must notify their leaders first and those who are not participating in debate must refrain from entering the chamber.This is legislating in the age of the novel coronavirus which has already infected at least two members of the House and one senator sending dozens more lawmakers who may have been exposed into self-quarantine out of an abundance of caution.“We have members on both sides of the aisle who have the virus” Representative Kevin McCarthy Republican of California and the minority leader told reporters on Thursday. “We have members who are quarantined. We have members who have challenges with their flights canceled. The floor will look different.”The precautions in the House build upon steps taken by the Senate in recent days as lawmakers remained in Washington — against the advice of public health officials to avoid congregating in large groups — to hammer out the details of the legislation.Votes typically scheduled for 15-minute intervals were lengthened to 30 and gloved staff served food in both the Senate lunches and in the cafeterias so that aides and reporters in Capitol Hill eateries did not have to touch even the pre-wrapped sandwiches or bottles of soda.Senator Mitt Romney Republican of Utah was spotted using his suit jacket to open doors while other senators used elbows or tissues to push elevator buttons and turn handles. (Mr. Romney later joined the ranks of the quarantined after having contact with Senator Rand Paul Republican of Kentucky the first senator to test positive for the disease caused by the coronavirus Covid-19.) Senator Bill Cassidy Republican of Louisiana and a doctor was among the most vigilant wiping down the Senate rostrum with disinfecting wipes and chastising colleagues to “social distance” on the floor of the chamber.In the House where lawmakers have been back home in their districts for more than a week Ms. Pelosi’s plan for a voice vote is highly unusual for a measure of such consequence. But leaders settled on it so that lawmakers who wanted to speak could make their views known and those who were not physically present would not be required to record a vote.But there is a risk: Technically the House cannot legislate without the presence of a quorum defined by the Constitution as a simple majority. (The House currently has 430 members; 216 are required for a quorum.) If even one member asserted that the House lacked a quorum and called for a recorded vote the House would have to cease its business until 216 lawmakers arrived.Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a liberal freshman Democrat from New York warned on Wednesday that she might do so. Representative Thomas Massie Republican of Kentucky who plans to vote no on the bill has also hinted that he might try to slow down its passage provoking anger among Democrats.“Dear @RepThomasMassie” Representative Dean Phillips Democrat of Minnesota wrote on Twitter on Thursday evening. “If you intend to delay passage of the #coronavirus relief bill tomorrow morning please advise your 428 colleagues RIGHT NOW so we can book flights and expend ~$200000 in taxpayer money to counter your principled but terribly misguided stunt.”Representative Steny H. Hoyer Democrat of Maryland and the majority leader has alerted Democrats that a Republican may object. If that happened House leaders would reschedule the vote for Saturday and lawmakers would have to return.“There could be one vote one grandstander you could have one grandstander for that we will take a little time” President Trump said at the White House on Thursday. “It will pass. We will take a little longer. Let’s see whether or not we have a grandstander.”It was unclear how many members would show up on Friday. On a private conference call on Thursday many House Democrats expressed an unwillingness to travel participants said. Mr. Hoyer told the rank and file that they should try to come to Washington if they felt comfortable doing so. But in a memo to House members the sergeant-at-arms and the Capitol physician urged caution.“Members should use extreme care and deliberation when making the determination to travel to Washington D.C.” they wrote adding that the physician’s office continued to recommend teleworking for all congressional offices.“In all cases members and staff must maintain six-foot social distance spacing as much as practicable when in the offices or the Capitol.”Still some decided to heed Mr. Hoyer’s call. Representative Joe Courtney Democrat of Connecticut said he knew of several colleagues who had decided to return to Washington for the vote including one who found a flight that was to arrive at 3 a.m. Mr. Courtney and his wife Audrey decided to drive.“The one thing she was insistent about was that she didn’t want me flying in a plane” Mr. Courtney said.So at 10:30 a.m. Thursday the couple left their home in Connecticut and got into their Ford Taurus with the congressman in the passenger seat conducting business — including a conference call with one of the governors of the Federal Reserve — while his wife drove. The roads were empty he said. They arrived in Washington six hours later.“There’s definitely some nervousness about whether or not there’s going to be a quorum call” Mr. Courtney said “and if I was home and missed that I would never forgive myself.”
213,The Most Powerful People in American Politics Are Over 65,Katie Glueck and Sabrina Tavernise,The New York Times,-1,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/politics/biden-trump-seniors.html,LAS VEGAS — Joseph R. Biden Jr. wasn’t accustomed to overflow audiences.It was a Tuesday evening in February and Mr. Biden had limped into Las Vegas bruised from his disappointing showings in the Iowa and New Hampshire nominating contests. But at Harbor Palace Seafood Restaurant a dim sum spot here a crowd of retirees had packed in to see the 77-year-old former vice president forming a line that snaked out the door.“I don’t like Warren and I don’t like Bernie because they want ‘Medicare for all’” said Alan Davis 80 dismissing the single-payer health care system promoted by Senator Bernie Sanders 78. “I’m totally against it. I have a good health plan.”Mr. Biden is “really human. He can feel how an ordinary person feels” said Minerva Honkala a retired teacher who identified herself as “65-plus.”Mr. Biden’s ability to connect with Ms. Honkala’s age group — through his résumé and more centrist tendencies his talk of shared values and his perceived general election promise — helped him regain his footing in Nevada surge to victory in South Carolina and catapult to his perch as the likely Democratic nominee. It was a rapid reversal of fortunes fueled by overwhelming support first from older black voters and ultimately from older voters more broadly a key part of his larger coalition.Now that age group is top of mind for many Americans as the nation confronts the staggering costs of the coronavirus crisis. It’s a vulnerable population in terms of the outbreak — and has become the focus of the public conversation. Health officials are pleading for young people to stay home to protect their parents and grandparents while in Texas Dan Patrick the Republican lieutenant governor suggested that older people might be willing to take risks in order to protect the economy sparking a national controversy.But politically the primary results this election season have highlighted the extraordinary sustained power of older Americans: Exit polls surveys and interviews with political strategists and demographers show that the concerns and preferences of these voters have played a critical role in defining the trajectory of the Democratic race so far and are poised to do so in the general election as well.In Florida a state with a significant retiree population Mr. Biden won the Democratic primary last week by nearly 40 percentage points a reflection of both his momentum in the race and his strength with constituencies including more moderate Latino voters African-Americans and college-educated white suburbanites. Among voters aged 65 and over Mr. Biden’s advantage was even starker: He was the choice of 70 percent of those voters while 5 percent said the same of Mr. Sanders according to a National Election Pool pre-election survey of Florida voters.“Older voters after African-American voters have been the single most important constituency for Joe Biden” said Celinda Lake a veteran Democratic pollster and political strategist who works with the Biden team but spoke in her personal capacity.Younger voters have had “tremendous influence” in shaping the contours of the Democratic debate pushing boldly progressive ideas on matters like   student loan debt reform to the fore said John Della Volpe the director of polling at Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics.Editors’ PicksThe Toilet Paper Had Armed Guards and Other Coronavirus StoriesCan Hip Rolls Help? Finding Uplift in Debbie Allen’s Instagram ClassWoody Allen’s New Memoir Is Sometimes Funny — and Tone Deaf and BanalWhen it comes to electoral outcomes however young people are being outflanked: “Rather than increasing their influence in 2020 what’s happened is their parents and grandparents have increased their influence” he said.Those Democratic grandparents especially tend to be more moderate more swayed by traditional government experience and more keenly focused on the tactics they believe are needed to defeat President Trump strategists and pollsters said.Mr. Biden who once faced significant competition for older Americans emerged in recent weeks as the dominant front-runner among those highly committed Democratic voters who have now helped bring him to the cusp of his party’s presidential nomination.Older voters have punched above their political weight for years with turnout among those 65 and older often double or more that of the youngest voters. As Americans age and become more rooted in their communities political participation tends to rise with their stake in society.Even in the midterm elections in 2018 hailed as a high-water mark for youth voting because the share of 18- to 24-year-olds nearly doubled from the previous midterm election the gap with older voters remained about the same. About 66 percent of eligible older people turned out compared with about 36 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds said William Frey a demographer at the Brookings Institution.“There’s no magic age for becoming a regular voter” said Carroll Doherty the director of political research at the Pew Research Center. “But when people move into their 40s that’s when you see voter turnout grow.”Certainly Mr. Sanders the overwhelming favorite with younger voters is continuing to campaign. And while the Vermont senator has acknowledged that younger voters did not appear to turn out at the rate he had hoped for polls and exit surveys show that Mr. Biden faces major challenges with that constituency a liberal slice of the electorate that his advisers acknowledge he will need to energize if he is the nominee.His standing with older voters is also poised to look different in a general election where that demographic is again influential — but traditionally has tilted much more conservative.“The irony is that the pattern is about to reverse in the general” Ms. Lake said pointing to Mr. Trump’s overall strength with older voters even as she added that “Donald Trump is despised by younger voters.”The virus has thrown politics completely and unpredictably up in the air. What will happen in Florida’s retirement communities — some of the most vulnerable in the nation to the virus — if Mr. Trump’s push to reopen the country fast comes to pass? It’s a question with potentially partisan implications.Older people have long leaned Republican. A majority have chosen Republicans in four of the last seven presidential elections according to Mr. Frey. In recent years they have also become more demographically distinct from the rest of the country: About 78 percent of eligible senior voters are white compared with just 67 percent of eligible voters in the country as a whole.Older voters favored Mr. Trump in 2016. In Pennsylvania they preferred him by a 10-point margin Mr. Frey said. In all 52 percent of older people — and 58 percent of white seniors — voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 Mr. Frey said.Seniors also show up particularly in swing states. In the Midwestern states of Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016 turnout among older voters was higher than the national average for that age group according to Mr. Frey. In Michigan for example 74 percent of older eligible voters turned out compared with just 38 percent of 18- to 24-year-old eligible voters.This presents a challenge for Mr. Biden should he win the nomination: how to get younger voters — who did not prefer him to begin with — to turn out for him while persuading their older counterparts who tend to choose Republicans to vote for him over Mr. Trump.In recent weeks Mr. Biden has increased his efforts to appeal to younger and more progressive voters ramping up outreach and embracing portions of proposals from Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren that take aim at the student debt burden.But throughout the primary contest Mr. Biden’s most consistent overtures were to older voters both substantively and through explicit and more subtle messaging.His inaugural bus trip across Iowa was called the “No Malarkey” tour a phrase that struck some younger voters as dated following Mr. Biden’s proactive mention in an autumn debate of a record player. It didn’t seem out of step with the older crowds at his events where Mr. Biden would often aim to connect over what he cast as similar upbringings.“The way we were raised all of you were raised the way I was raised everything’s about integrity and decency” he said in Emmetsburg Iowa in December.On the policy front his experience in foreign affairs and his support for building on the Affordable Care Act while allowing Americans the option of maintaining their private insurance resonated with older voters.There were “almost pragmatic urgent worries about health care that people want addressed in the short term” Stanley B. Greenberg a longtime Democratic pollster said when asked about the age gap at play in the primary. Several Sanders priorities he continued including “Medicare for all climate change and student debt — almost all of them are kind of long term.”Younger voters who were focused on the future he added  “have more space to deal with it.”Mr. Biden struggled in Iowa and New Hampshire when he faced a crowded primary field and significant competition for many demographics. Over the summer and into the fall  older people often voiced concerns about Mr. Biden’s sharpness and stamina. Voters who were close to Mr. Biden’s age were often keenly aware of their own limitations — and some worried about whether he faced the same challenges they did.“Early on they weren’t sold on Joe Biden” said Patrick Murray director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. “Many of them felt he was too old.”Those voters he said were also drawn to candidates like Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota or former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend Ind. But as those candidates dropped out and endorsed Mr. Biden on the eve of Super Tuesday he shored up his strength with older white voters while his appeal to older black voters continued apace: He went on to win the support of a stunning 94 percent of black voters over the age of 60 in Mississippi according to exit polls.Older Americans will soon be even more important. Mr. Frey noted that the large “Baby Boom” generation has only just begun entering the older American voting bloc. He has calculated that the number of senior eligible voters will rise to 68 million in 2028 from 47 million in 2016.“The second half of the boomer generation has yet to turn 65” he said. “When more of them do they are going to make this older voting bloc even more prized especially in the northern swing states like Iowa Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania.”Mr. Biden who was born in Scranton Pa. and emphasizes his working-class roots is not ceding those voters and his allies argue that his strong performance with older voters in the primary signals an ability to cut into what has historically been a Republican advantage in the general election.Andrew Bates a spokesman for the Biden campaign said that Mr. Biden would offer a clear contrast with Mr. Trump’s record on health care and social safety net matters promising that “older Americans will remember whose values align with theirs this fall.” Sarah Matthews a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign defended that record calling Mr. Trump a “proven champion for seniors” — a sign of possible clashes to come.But first there is still a primary contest and the age gap between Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders has been on vivid display all year. The senator favored large rallies that attracted devoted young people while Mr. Biden’s events even in his strongest states tended to be smaller with crowds that tilted older.Now because the coronavirus outbreak forced an end to traditional campaigning Mr. Biden’s efforts to reach voters — old and young — are typically online anyway.He and his team are working on a podcast and he has hosted a virtual happy hour with younger supporters — but his efforts have faced technological difficulties and Mr. Biden has admitted it is challenging to adjust.“As you can tell” he wrote in a newsletter on Wednesday “I’m still getting used to this virtual world we’re campaigning in.”
214,Can Trump Break a 50 Percent Approval Rating?,Giovanni Russonello,The New York Times,-1,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/politics/trump-polls-coronavirus.html,With the United States now leading the world in confirmed coronavirus cases Americans finally agree across party lines that the threat can’t be ignored.More than nine in 10 voters nationwide are concerned about the spread of the virus according to a Fox News poll released Thursday. And roughly that share of all Americans consider it a major threat to the economy a Pew poll also released Thursday found.In both cases Democrats feel this way almost unanimously and Republicans overwhelmingly agree. That bipartisan consensus applies to people’s impressions of their state governments which have received broadly positive marks in various polls.But as usual it dries up wherever President Trump is concerned.As he responds to the pandemic Mr. Trump has seen a small uptick in his approval rating which hit record highs in surveys released this week by Gallup (49 percent) Fox (48 percent) Monmouth University (46 percent) and Pew (45 percent).Still his approval rating remains stubbornly lodged below 50 percent across the board. That’s a barrier Mr. Trump has not been able to breach in most credible polls throughout his term with Americans on both sides generally steadfast in their feelings about him.He gets slightly better ratings for his handling of the coronavirus outbreak than for his job performance over all — but even on this his approval is stuck around the 50-yard line. Three-quarters of Democratic voters give his response to the crisis negative marks according to the Fox poll while 86 percent of Republican voters say the opposite.During times of international conflict or emergency it is typical for a national leader’s approval ratings to experience a so-called rally effect. Yet while Mr. Trump has tried to frame himself as a “wartime president” during the pandemic this catastrophe is different than most. It has not involved a foreign adversary or a single traumatic event as wartime crises often do.From the beginning it has played out as an unfolding sequence of gradual strategic decisions aimed at what the president calls “the invisible enemy.” As a result the way Mr. Trump is being graded for his response largely accords with how people already felt about his style of governing.“People had opinions about this president very early in his administration and they were strongly held opinions” Alec Tyson a senior researcher at the Pew Research Center said in an interview. “It’s unlikely that people are just developing opinions about Trump now.”To the degree that Mr. Trump is getting a bump in approval the Pew poll found that it was coming especially from those who consider themselves political independents but lean Republican. His approval rating has leapt nine percentage points with these Americans since January when the coronavirus was first detected in the United States. (Disapproval of Mr. Trump also softened slightly among Democrats though to a lesser degree.)This group could represent a crucial voting bloc for Mr. Trump in the November general election. As partisan Republicans have coalesced around him he has struggled among some moderate and conservative voters who don’t feel an allegiance to the party. If former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. secures the Democratic nomination he is certain to make an aggressive play for many of these voters.In a sign of how prevalent the virus’s effects already are more than one in 10 voters in the Fox poll said they knew someone who had been infected. And 43 percent said they or someone in their household had lost work because of the virus including two-fifths of Republican voters.Many Americans who might not typically pay close attention to politics may now be looking to Mr. Trump and Congress for a solution. Ninety-five percent of voters said they were following virus-related news at least somewhat closely the Fox poll found. And as Congress pieced together an enormous $2 trillion stimulus package this week voters’ approval of Congress reached a 10-year high. At just 31 percent it’s still dismal — but over the past decade that number has more typically lingered in the teens.The president’s daily news briefings during the crisis have averaged about 8.5 million viewers on cable news channels on par with the season finale of “The Bachelor.” Those numbers don’t include the millions of people who are watching on broadcast stations and over the internet.Mr. Trump is typically flanked at these briefings by government doctors and members of his administration and his confident freewheeling style may appeal to certain persuadable voters. But if the death toll skyrockets and the economy stays dormant Mr. Trump’s hesitancy to take certain broad federal actions could expose him to criticism.In the Fox poll most voters said the federal government had done a poor or only fair job of responding quickly to the virus. And by a 19-point margin voters said a stronger government response could have helped to quell the spread of the virus. Fifty-four percent of moderate voters said so.
215,As Coronavirus Crisis Unfolds Sanders Sees a Moment That Matches His Ideas,Sydney Ember,The New York Times,-1,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/us/politics/bernie-sanders-coronavirus.html,Both hands were waving — over here over there a full wingspan on display — as Bernie Sanders directed his most biting sarcasm at his “Republican friends.”Excuse him forgive him for wanting working people to get a few more bucks for a few more months as part of the sweeping stimulus bill that was being debated on the Senate floor. Excuse him forgive him for not wanting “to punish the poor and working people” struggling to weather the economic meltdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic.“My Republican colleagues are very distressed” he said late Wednesday.“Oh my God the universe is collapsing!” he said so passionately that he nearly spat. “Oh my word will the universe survive?!”With the virus bringing the nation to a virtual stop there is no real presidential campaign for Mr. Sanders to engage in and even if there were he is almost hopelessly behind Joseph R. Biden Jr. in the delegate count. Many Democrats and even some allies have said it is time for him to bow out — or at minimum articulate publicly why he wants to remain in the race.But Mr. Sanders is still running in large part allies and aides say because he believes he can meld this moment of national crisis with the progressive policy agenda that has been his life’s work.“For someone who has built a career out of campaigning against the inequality of our health care system this is prime time” said Nick Carter who served as political outreach director for the 2016 Sanders campaign.So Mr. Sanders will take the stage when he can get it — including on the Senate floor Wednesday night but also in news releases radio and television interviews and live streams where he studiously repeats his mantra to loyalists who once crowded Iowa auditoriums to cheer him but now must settle for sometimes technologically challenged digital presentations.It is unclear who exactly is listening or whether he can make a difference. Even Mr. Biden as the likely Democratic nominee to face President Trump has struggled to get visibility. Both candidates are being overshadowed by daily briefings from Mr. Trump and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York.In an interview on Thursday with the radio program “1A” Mr. Sanders did not say how long he intended to stay in the race but suggested he was not going anywhere soon. And he rebuffed a comparison to his 2016 campaign when he fought Hillary Clinton to the bitter end arguing that the coronavirus made the two situations different because many states this year had postponed their primaries.“You’re talking about an election without elections” he said. “What does that mean? It’s kind of unprecedented.”His campaign says he is still actively running for president and there is other concrete evidence he is. On Tuesday his team confirmed that he planned to participate in an April debate with Mr. Biden if there is one. The Bern app a proprietary smartphone app that the campaign uses to organize volunteers still includes an option for supporters to send their networks a text message encouraging them to mail in ballots according to an aide. Under phone bank event listings on his campaign website volunteers are urged to “join campaign staff as we outreach our communities.”But his campaign is not actively advertising on Facebook and has not made any significant television ad buys since March 12. He has not actively fund-raised for his campaign in over a week though his campaign has used its extensive email list to raise money for charities to help people during the virus crisis. On Wednesday his campaign sent an email to supporters asking them to sign a petition to help Amazon workers.Some Democratic supporters of his have said it’s time to end his campaign including Robert Reich the former labor secretary. Other Democrats say that if he stays in he should make clear his motivation and his goal.“I’ve never seen Bernie as someone who is selfish I’ve always thought of him as being an advocate for his cause” Jay Jacobs the chairman of the New York State Democratic Party said in an interview. “If he stays in the race for no reason that would be selfish.”In conversations with aides and allies since March 17 — when stinging losses in three states left him with no realistic chance at winning the Democratic nomination — many said he viewed this as an extraordinary moment that not only demands the kind of political revolution he has championed since he was the mayor of Burlington Vt. but also underscores why the country would have been better off if his liberal policy agenda was already in place.Mr. Sanders has appeared eager to put himself front and center for his supporters holding live stream events on the virus nearly every night and pushing out a long list of policy proposals to handle the outbreak that included providing every American with a check for $2000 a month.In a sign of his political influence he threatened on Wednesday afternoon to hold up the economic stimulus bill if Republicans continued to fight unemployment benefits that they feared would be larger than some people’s wages — the reason for his sarcastic denunciations in the Senate chamber.“While we do our best to address these crises it is extremely important that we try to understand how we got to where we are today and the need to bring about fundamental reform of American society” Mr. Sanders said during a live stream event on Wednesday night after running viewers through major elements of the stimulus bill.Many of his supporters are still holding out faint hope that he can win the nomination arguing that the coronavirus outbreak has made even unlikely scenarios possible. Already many states have pushed their primaries back to June 2 making it impossible for Mr. Biden to clinch the nomination before then. There are murmurs among some allies that Mr. Sanders intends to stay in at least until the primary in New York which is scheduled for April 28 but could be pushed back to June 23.Some want him to stay in the race indefinitely because his candidacy provides him the megaphone to shape the narrative of the progressive agenda and will give him leverage as he seeks policy concessions from Mr. Biden and influence over the party’s platform.Some close to him suggested that his coronavirus outreach was a way to keep his supporters motivated and engaged during this strange time of suspended animation so that the campaign can jump-start them into action if he decides to rev his candidacy back up.His detractors however point out that he has chosen to hold his own events and speak to his own supporters but until Wednesday had largely left the congressional proceedings to others — including his former rival Senator Elizabeth Warren who was active in helping to shape the rescue bill. On Sunday when fellow Senate Democrats blocked an action on the bill that delayed progress he skipped the vote instead remaining in Burlington to air a live stream with Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib.Some aides said he chose not to fly to Washington for the vote because its outcome was never in doubt. But others close to him professed confusion that he had passed up even a symbolic opportunity to offer his voice in the midst of a national emergency.As Mr. Sanders continues to mull his campaign’s future few aides are willing to so much as speculate what he will decide to do. When he returned to Burlington last week none of his closest advisers went with him. Neither Jeff Weaver a top adviser nor his campaign manager Faiz Shakir has responded to interview requests for days.“I’m officially declining to comment” Mr. Shakir said in a text message on Thursday. “Feel free to use that if you’d like.”Mr. Sanders in the meantime has said more than once — including during Thursday’s radio interview — that he is winning the generational and ideological debate. And he seems ready to carry the debate forward. Only he knows for how long.Stephanie Saul and Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting.
216,Can the House Pass a $2 Trillion Stimulus by Voice Vote? Here’s How It Works,Sheryl Gay Stolberg,The New York Times,-1,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/politics/stimulus-package-voice-vote.html,WASHINGTON — The House planned on Friday to use an extraordinary method to push through a $2 trillion stimulus package to respond to the coronavirus pandemic. Leaders in both parties were aiming to pass the measure by a voice vote — highly unusual for such consequential legislation — so that members who were either sick or in quarantine could be spared a trip to Washington to vote in person.But the vote could be delayed if even one lawmaker objects and calls for a quorum or a recorded vote. Two lawmakers — Representative Thomas Massie Republican of Kentucky and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Democrat of New York — have threatened to do so. Lawmakers and President Trump fear that Mr. Massie is the one most likely to make good on that threat.That has generated a great deal of uncertainty on Capitol Hill sending lawmakers rushing to Washington from all corners of the country in case they are needed to pass the measure. Here’s what’s going on:What is a voice vote and why is the House doing one?There are several types of votes in the House. A voice vote is when the presiding officer asks for members to simply call out “aye” or “nay” in support or opposition of a bill. This is the fastest way to vote. The majority in the House — the Democrats in this case — typically announces that “the ayes have it” and the measure passes in an instant.But before that call is official any member may interject and call for a recorded vote. That usually prompts a roll call in which members must be present on the House floor so that they can insert their personalized cards resembling credit cards into electronic voting machines in the chamber and register as “yes” “no” or “present.”With lawmakers scattered around the country leaders had planned a voice vote to spare lawmakers the need to return to Washington.What happens if someone objects?The Constitution says that in both the House and the Senate “a majority of each shall constitute a quorum to do business.” In the 435-member House which currently has five vacancies 216 now constitutes a quorum. When the House votes by voice it is presumed that a quorum is present.But if any lawmaker called for a quorum and fewer than 216 members were present the speaker would be obligated to count to determine whether in fact there were enough members present to allow legislative action. If the House fell short of a quorum Speaker Nancy Pelosi would have to summon members back putting off a vote until later Friday or Saturday.If the speaker determined there was in fact a quorum she could overrule the point of order. If the representative insisted on an electronically recorded vote he or she could ask for the yeas and nays and hope that one-fifth of the Members present rise to indicate their support for the request.How would a recorded vote work given requirements for social distancing?Typically House floor votes are crowded free-for-alls where lawmakers swarm in the well of the chamber chatting and strategizing in scrums. In the era of the coronavirus which has sickened at least three sitting lawmakers and led dozens more to quarantine things will look very different.The sergeant-at-arms and attending physician of the Capitol have issued guidance on voting and will monitor the number of members in the Capitol and on the floor “to ensure we maintain safe social distancing at all times” according to a memo sent to lawmakers on Thursday.In the event of a recorded vote the memo said lawmakers would vote in blocks. “Voting will be done alphabetically in groups of 30 members over an extended period of time” the memo said “to minimize the risks posed by placing too many individuals in one location.”Would an objection kill the stimulus bill?No. The legislation which the Senate passed unanimously on Wednesday is overwhelmingly supported by Democrats and Republicans as well as Mr. Trump. An objection on Friday might slow its passage but it is all but certain to be approved and quickly signed by the president.
217,Man Charged With Making Death Threats to Nancy Pelosi in Coronavirus Rant,Neil Vigdor,The New York Times,-1,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/us/texas-man-pelosi-death-threats-virus.html,A Texas man ranting on social media about the congressional response to the coronavirus outbreak has been charged with making death threats to Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democrats federal prosecutors announced on Thursday.Gavin Weslee Blake Perry 27 of Wichita Falls Texas wrote on his personal Facebook page on Monday that Ms. Pelosi was part of a satanic cult and that she and other Democrats should be killed the authorities said.The posts were still online as of Thursday night.Prosecutors said that Mr. Perry wrote “If youre a dem or apart of the establishment in the democrats side I view you as a criminal and a terrorist and I advise everyone to Go SOS and use live rounds.”The post which used an abbreviation for “shoot on sight” included a screenshot of what appeared to be two tweets by Senator Chuck Schumer of New York the Democratic leader. One by Mr. Schumer himself was critical of President Trump’s handling of the health emergency.The second was written by someone impersonating Mr. Schumer and criticized Mr. Trump for barring travelers from entering the United States from China.“Shoot to kill” Mr. Perry wrote according to prosecutors. “This is a revolution.”Mr. Perry was charged with transmitting a threatening communication in interstate commerce and faces up to five years in prison.Mr. Perry who was arrested on Wednesday and remains in custody did not have a lawyer as of Thursday night according to court records. He made an initial appearance in United States District Court in Northern Texas on Thursday via videoconference.His alleged screed came as Congress and the Trump administration were negotiating a $2 trillion stimulus package to reduce the economic havoc caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The Senate approved the package on Wednesday and it has advanced to the House.Prosecutors said that Mr. Perry told the law enforcement officers who arrested him that they were violating his First Amendment right to free speech and that their actions were punishable by death.“The Department of Justice takes the security of our public servants seriously” Erin Nealy Cox the United States attorney for Northern Texas said in a statement. “Americans are entitled to voice their opinions — but we will not allow them to threaten our officials’ physical safety.”The threats against Ms. Pelosi were posted beneath an article from an anti-abortion website that Mr. Perry shared on Facebook.“Nancy pelosi is apart of a santanic cult and so are rhe people who work closly with her” Mr. Perry wrote according to prosecutors. “Dems of the establishment will be removed at any cost necessary and yes that means by death.”Ms. Pelosi’s office declined to comment and Mr. Schumer’s office said it could not immediately comment on Thursday night.This month a Connecticut man was arrested on charges that he threatened to kill Representative Adam Schiff of California the Democrat who was the lead impeachment manager in the House. Several other Democratic lawmakers have faced similar death threats.Law enforcement officials said a concerned citizen tipped off local police about Mr. Perry’s posts.“The defendant threatened the life of an elected official and that will not be tolerated” Matthew J. DeSarno the F.B.I. special agent in charge in Dallas said in a statement.
218,After Considering $1 Billion Price Tag for Ventilators White House Has Second Thoughts,David E. Sanger Maggie Haberman and Zolan Kanno-Youngs,The New York Times,-1,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/us/politics/coronavirus-ventilators-trump.html,WASHINGTON — The White House had been preparing to reveal on Wednesday a joint venture between General Motors and Ventec Life Systems that would allow for the production of as many as 80000 desperately needed ventilators to respond to an escalating pandemic when word suddenly came down that the announcement was off.The decision to cancel the announcement government officials say came after the Federal Emergency Management Agency said it needed more time to assess whether the estimated cost was prohibitive. That price tag was more than $1 billion with several hundred million dollars to be paid upfront to General Motors to retool a car parts plant in Kokomo Ind. where the ventilators would be made with Ventec’s technology.Government officials said that the deal might still happen but that they are examining at least a dozen other proposals. And they contend that an initial promise that the joint venture could turn out 20000 ventilators in short order had shrunk to 7500 with even that number in doubt. Longtime emergency managers at FEMA are working with military officials to sort through the competing offers and federal procurement rules while under pressure to give President Trump something to announce.But in an interview Thursday night with Sean Hannity the president played down the need for ventilators.“I don’t believe you need 40000 or 30000 ventilators” he said a reference to New York where Gov. Andrew Cuomo has appealed for federal help in obtaining them. “You go into major hospitals sometimes and they’ll have two ventilators. And now all of a sudden they’re saying ‘Can we order 30000 ventilators?’”A General Motors spokesman said that “Project V” as the ventilator program is known was moving very fast and a company official said “there’s no issue with retooling.”A Ventec representative agreed.“Ventec and G.M. have been working at breakneck speed to leverage our collective expertise in ventilation and manufacturing to meet the needs of the country as quickly as possible and arm medical professionals with the number of ventilators needed to save lives” said Chris O. Brooks Ventec’s chief strategy officer.The only thing missing was clarity from the government about how many ventilators they needed — and who would be paid to build them.The shortage of ventilators has emerged as one of the major criticisms of the Trump administration’s response to the coronavirus. The need to quickly equip hospitals across the country with tens of thousands more of the devices to treat those most seriously ill with the virus was not anticipated despite the Trump administration’s own projection in a simulation last year that millions of people could be hospitalized. And even now the effort to produce them has been confused and disorganized.At the center of the discussion about how to ramp up the production of ventilators is Jared Kushner the president’s son-in-law and a senior White House aide who has told people that he was called in two weeks ago by Vice President Mike Pence to produce more coronavirus test kits and who has now turned his attention to ventilators.He has been directing officials at FEMA in the effort. Two officials said the suggestion to wait on the General Motors offer came from Col. Patrick Work who is working at FEMA. Some government officials expressed concern about the possibility of ordering too many ventilators leaving them with an expensive surplus.As the agency has sorted through offers trying to weigh production ability and costs hospitals in New York and elsewhere are reporting a desperate need for more ventilators which are critical in treating respiratory problems in a fast-rising tide of severe coronavirus cases.A spokeswoman for FEMA said Colonel Work presented information on each contract in such meetings but did not make any recommendations. A White House spokesman declined to comment.The involvement of General Motors was first floated this month as the carmaker’s factory floor in Kokomo was grinding to a halt and workers were being sent home — partly because the market was collapsing but also because workers would otherwise risk exposure to the coronavirus.Last week General Motors Ventec Life Systems and a coalition of business executives called StopTheSpread.org issued a statement saying that Ventec would “leverage G.M.’s logistics purchasing and manufacturing expertise to build more of their critically important ventilators” including some portable units.By Sunday Mr. Trump appeared to suggest on Twitter that a deal had been completed to mass-produce the ventilators even though it was unclear who would pay to equip the General Motors plant or how long that process would take.“Ford General Motors and Tesla are being given the go ahead to make ventilators and other metal products FAST! @fema” he wrote. “Go for it auto execs lets see how good you are?”Not for the first time has Mr. Trump jumped the gun.Tesla officials had in fact met with engineers from the medical device company Medtronic in a separate negotiation but no partnership has yet been announced. And while the chief executive of General Motors Mary T. Barra was enthused about the ventilator idea Mr. Trump’s own aides had not embraced the G.M.-Ventec partnership — in part because they had not seen the specifics of the proposal.Administration officials said Thursday that they were struggling to understand just how many ventilators the new venture could make.The initial projection one senior administration official said was that after three weeks of preparation it could produce an initial run of 20000 ventilators or about two-thirds of what Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York recently said his state alone needed to cover the influx of coronavirus patients expected in two weeks if not sooner.That number then shrank to 7500 ventilators in the initial run or maybe 5000 an apparent recognition that auto transmissions and ventilators had very little in common. Those numbers are in flux and so are the Trump administration’s because the White House cannot decide how many ventilators it wants.Targets have changed by the hour officials said as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the Department of Health and Human Services the Food and Drug Administration which approves the use of medical devices and the White House try to figure out how many ventilators to request and how much they should cost.Those issues appeared to come to a head on Wednesday afternoon when FEMA told the White House that it was premature to make a decision.The $1.5 billion price tag comes to around $18000 a ventilator. And the overall cost by comparison is roughly equal to buying 18 F-35s the Pentagon’s most advanced fighter jet.So on Wednesday despite the president’s tweet three days earlier FEMA was still weighing competing offers in order to make a recommendation to Mr. Kushner. And it seemed clear to several officials that the agency would have to select multiple manufacturers in part to avoid the risk that one production line runs into technical troubles or that its workers contract the very virus the ventilators are being built to defeat.
219,How Will the Spending Be Spun?,Lisa Lerer,The New York Times,-1,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/us/politics/on-politics-coronavirus-congress.html,During the Great Recession with the economy in free fall Congress rushed to pass the largest bailout and stimulus measures in American history. Those decisions helped stabilize the American economy but shook up the political landscape birthing the conservative Tea Party movement and revitalizing progressive politics.The $2 trillion economic stabilization package expected to be finalized this week makes the $700 billion Wall Street bailout in 2008 and the $800 billion stimulus bill in 2009 look like pocket change.Like the Great Recession this current national crisis could have political implications that reverberate far longer than the public health and economic impacts. Activists on both the right and the left say this mind-boggling amount of government spending could rewire our politics perhaps in extraordinary ways.“This crisis is exposing a lot of problems and vulnerabilities and injustices” said Sarah Miller head of the American Economic Liberties Project a new organization dedicated to pushing government to confront corporate power. “Now this bill is really laying them out into the sunshine for the public.”For critics of the legislation the devil is in the details. Sure the bill includes something for everyone: loans and grants for corporations and small businesses increased unemployment benefits for workers who are laid off or working fewer hours and direct payments of $1200 per adult and $500 per child for low- and middle-income individuals and families.But the biggest portion of spending — more than $500 billion — goes to large corporations and industries. Provisions include $32 billion for the airline industry $17 billion for “businesses critical to maintaining national security”— a category seen as intended at least partly for Boeing — and a tweak to federal tax law sought by restaurants and retailers that could save their industries $15 billion a year.Some companies owned by the family of President Trump’s son-in-law and White House adviser Jared Kushner could benefit. And despite Democratic efforts Mr. Trump’s companies would not be prohibited from benefiting from some elements of the bill.And that may be only the first round of spending.“Everything about this is deeply concerning” said Jenny Beth Martin a co-founder of one of the first Tea Party organizations the Tea Party Patriots. “There are going to be so many unintended consequences from the month of March 2020. It will be years before we sort out what just happened.”Yet for Tea Party supporters like Ms. Martin the situation is complicated. For years they excoriated big government helping to elect a new class of lawmakers determined to slash spending.That is until Mr. Trump took office.Mr. Trump’s incoming chief of staff Mark Meadows and his departing acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney both tied their congressional careers to the Tea Party movement. Now Mr. Mulvaney Mr. Meadows and other Tea Party politicians are top supporters of the administration — and of the record-breaking level of spending pushed by the White House even before the coronavirus crisis.All have been cautious not to use the B-word (bailout) or even the S-word (stimulus) when it comes to describing the economic stabilization package.Tim Phillips president of Americans for Prosperity a group that helped fund and organize Tea Party activists drew a firm distinction between the 2008 bailout and today’s package.“This is very different than in 2008-2009 which was an abject cronyistic bailout” said Mr. Phillips who said he had discussed the package on town-hall-style events conducted via telephone with thousands of his group’s supporters. “The American public gets that this is a very different situation. It affects almost everyone.”That position may be hard to maintain if the money becomes as critics fear a “slush fund” for big corporations. Senate Democrats successfully maneuvered to include more oversight and transparency in the legislation but how the Treasury Department handles the distribution of the funds will be closely watched particularly as average Americans struggle to survive the crisis.During the previous administration the Wall Street bailout came to be associated with President Barack Obama even though it was passed under his predecessor. Some liberal activists unhappy with the program were reluctant to drive their economic message against a president popular with progressives.They will face no such hesitation this time around with Mr. Trump’s administration providing an easy foil and prominent leaders of the movement — like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York — already making their case.“We see this giant slush fund that Steven Mnuchin has a lot of authority over with limited strings attached” Ms. Miller said referring to the Treasury secretary. “This was a bill that fundamentally restructures our economy and while it does provide some critical help it also is going to exacerbate these massive imbalances of economic power.”
220,The Coronavirus Economy: When Washington Takes Over Business,Jim Tankersley Alan Rappeport David Gelles Peter Eavis and David Yaffe-Bellany,The New York Times,-1,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/business/economy/coronavirus-relief-bill.html,The $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package that the Senate passed on Wednesday will fundamentally transform the U.S. government by placing thousands of businesses and millions of workers on federally funded life support.The government will pay the wages of some workers who remain on their companies’ payrolls. It will sustain other workers who have lost their jobs with checks that are as large as — or even larger than — what they were earning before they were laid off. And it will cushion some of the country’s largest corporations from bankruptcy with taxpayers taking shares in those companies as collateral.Rarely before has the government involved itself so deeply in the business of business. Amid a historic drop-off in economic activity the bill temporarily transfers financial responsibility from private industry to the federal government allowing the United States to control the levers of capitalism and potentially decide who wins and who loses. The level of intervention this week far outstrips the financial scope and breadth of recovery efforts during the 2008 financial crisis.That is a controversial proposition in normal times but one lawmakers deemed necessary now as companies large and small from airlines and big banks to nail salons and brew pubs face unprecedented hardship. The ripple effects have already sent millions of Americans into unemployment.“We went to bed as America and woke up the next morning looking like social democratic Europe” Erik Gordon professor at the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan said. “We’ve made fun of Europe propping up their failing steel companies and car companies and when push comes to shove we’re going to outdo them.”The government’s intervention will come in a variety of ways including direct payments to individuals and businesses generous loans in which the government agrees to backstop losses and equity stakes in companies. But there are strings attached such as limits on executive pay and provisions that require companies receiving assistance to maintain employment levels at 90 percent of what they were.Midsize companies or those with between 500 and 10000 employees get to borrow at an interest rate that is not higher than 2 percent annually and don’t have to repay principal or interest for six months. The midsize companies cannot “outsource or offshore” jobs from the start of the loan until two years after it has been repaid.Businesses with 500 or fewer employees will get loans directly from banks to cover more than two months of payrolls and some other operating expenses with the government paying off the balance so long as the companies either do not lay off workers or rehire ones they’ve already let go.The government will inject more than $60 billion into the airline industry including $25 billion in grants to pay employees of passenger airlines and $4 billion for those who work at cargo airlines. About $17 billion has been set aside largely for Boeing which because of two deadly crashes was troubled before the virus brought many commercial flights to a standstill.Editors’ PicksThe Toilet Paper Had Armed Guards and Other Coronavirus StoriesWoody Allen’s New Memoir Is Sometimes Funny — and Tone Deaf and BanalThe New Travel Document: Photograph of an Empty PlaneNot all businesses will be eligible for help and not every eligible company will agree to the government’s terms. And some industries including cruise lines and energy companies were left on the sidelines.The major cruise companies appear not to qualify for loans because they are domiciled outside the United States and their employees are spread across the world.“We didn’t seek or expect a cash bailout and it doesn’t appear anyway that we would qualify under the terms” said Roger Frizzell a spokesman for Carnival Corporation. “We have a significant employee presence in the U.S. but a majority of our employees are on ships not in any location certainly not based in the U.S.”The legislation also does not include $3 billion that the Trump administration requested to buy crude oil for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Such a purchase could have helped lift demand for oil and thus its price which in the United States has tumbled to less than $25 a barrel in recent weeks. Solar and wind businesses were upset that lawmakers did not make it easier for them to benefit from tax credits for renewable energy.The epicenter of the intervention will be the Treasury Department where Secretary Steven Mnuchin will oversee nearly a third of the $2 trillion in economic relief funds that Congress is approving.The money will be held in two pots: $350 billion will be devoted to loans and loan guarantees for small businesses. And $500 billion will be divided among airlines and companies that are critical to national security including Boeing and will prop up the Federal Reserve’s new emergency lending facilities which are intended to inject nearly $4 trillion into the economy.Mr. Mnuchin said on Thursday that the distribution of the money would be fully transparent. “When we do take actions either through our direct program or throughout programs with the Fed there will be disclosures to the American public much faster than they would normally occur” he said on CNBC.Businesses will also have to cede some control to the federal government in exchange for lifelines. Companies that borrow money are forbidden to repurchase their stock or pay dividends during the loan and for a year after it is repaid. They must not cut staffing by more than 10 percent through the end of September.Loans to small businesses with 500 employees or fewer are limited to $10 million. Loans to cover salaries of over $100000 wouldn’t qualify for forgiveness and businesses must demonstrate that they had not recently laid off employees or a smaller amount of the loan would be subject to forgiveness.Businesses would not have to repay loans covering up to eight weeks’ worth of payroll expenses. That means that once businesses receive their loans a new clock will begin to tick: They’ll have to use the money within two months to avoid repaying it; they also can’t pay any employee more than $10000 in those two months if they want that amount to be forgiven.Lawmakers also placed restrictions on compensation and pay increases for executives moves intended to address one of the criticisms about bailouts during the 2008 crisis. But pay limits will not necessarily do away with multimillion-dollar paydays for corporate bosses.Executives who made more than $3 million in 2019 could be awarded $3 million plus half of any sum in excess of $3 million. As a result a chief executive who earned $20 million in 2019 would be allowed compensation of $11.5 million. The restrictions would apply from the time the federal support began to one year after it ended.Even as the government takes on an outsize role in overseeing companies Mr. Mnuchin maintained that it should not be in the business of dictating what private companies did.“We don’t believe in mandating and regulating certain big businesses” he said.And big business despite its need for help has seemed unwilling to cede too much control to the government. On Tuesday Boeing’s chief executive David Calhoun suggested that he wasn’t interested in the government’s taking an equity stake in the company despite the beleaguered state of the aerospace giant.“I don’t have a need for an equity stake” Mr. Calhoun said in an interview on Fox Business Network. “If they forced it we’d just look at all the other options and we have got plenty.”Boeing which had lobbied for government aid was not specifically named in the bill. It nonetheless signaled its approval of the stimulus package on Wednesday night. “The bill’s access to public and private liquidity including loans and loan guarantees is critical for airlines airports suppliers and manufacturers to bridge to recovery” Boeing said in a statement.The House is now expected to take up the legislation and President Trump has signaled that he would sign it quickly into law.Many of the provisions are intended to offer lifelines to companies and workers over the coming months as the country struggles to contain the pandemic and braces for a recession. But the long-term consequences of a $2 trillion bailout of the American economy are unknown.“This is going to be hard to unravel” said Mr. Gordon the University of Michigan professor. “Industries that are propped up stay propped up for a long time.”

As the U.S. surpasses Italy and China to have the most confirmed cases of COVID-19 the Trump administration is still dragging its fee on ventilators and promising America will be open for business again by Easter (April 12).  Meanwhile more and more state leaders are telling residents to stay home and ordering ""non-essential"" businesses closed.Politically speaking the president might be making a brilliant move: Allow other people to make the difficult decisions then point to the inevitable-either-way economic devastation as something that could have been prevented if only we had gone to work sooner. Or maybe that's just the best-case scenario. President Donald Trump could try to interfere with states' ability to impose social distancing rules. No he's not going to send the military to reopen bars and movie theaters. But financial aid to state governments gives Washington all sorts of carrots and sticks. For now though that doesn't seem to be on the horizon. In a letter to state leaders yesterday Trump announced that ""new guidelines for State and local policymakers to use in making decisions about maintaining increasing or relaxing social distancing and other mitigation measures"" would be coming soon. Using ""data-driven criteria we will suggest guidelines categorizing counties as high-risk medium-risk or low-risk"" he said. That might not be a bad idea. As J.D. Tuccille wrote this week in Reason we need to recognize that different areas of this country have very different risk profiles. COVID-19 and criminal justice.

After a day of performative fussing and fighting over partisan particulars in the COVID-19 relief bill U.S. senators last night passed—96 to 0—the $2 trillion spending measure largely unchanged.The part getting the most attention is the direct payments: $1200 each for single Americans who made under $75000 dual-income married couples who made under $150000 or single-income heads of household who made under $112500 in annual adjusted gross income in 2019. Pro-rated amounts will go to single filers making up to $99000 and couples making up to $198000. Families get an additional $500 for each child age 16 and under.

Meanwhile federal prosecutors in Maryland filed motions today in that case and a similar case opposing inmates' petitions to be transferred from a halfway house to home confinement.Last Friday a U.S. District Judge ordered Erica Cook a federal inmate currently residing at a halfway house in Baltimore to be released into home confinement following an emergency motion for her immediate transfer. Cook was scheduled to be released into home confinement on April 22.However Cook's attorney Brian Stekloff says the BOP hasn't budged to move Cook since the judge's order and today the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Maryland filed a motion asking the judge to reconsider the order.The motion notes that ""residents in halfway houses typically live in close quarters with many other people just like in nursing homes and prisons [and] eat socialize and participate in programming in common areas just like in nursing homes and prisons.

223,Libertarian Party's Presidential Nominating Convention in Coronavirus Limbo,MATT WELCH ,Reason,1,https://reason.com/2020/03/25/libertarian-partys-presidential-nominating-convention-in-coronavirus-limbo/,"On Tuesday the city of Austin Texas issued a coronavirus-avoidance stay-at-home order that permits residents to leave their homes only for ""essential"" work and activities such as providing medical care or buying groceries. The order which lasts preliminarily until April 13 could have at least an indirect impact on the 2020 presidential race.That's because Austin is the site for what was scheduled to be the May 21-25 Libertarian National Convention and because the convention—quite unlike its Democratic and Republican counterparts—is the sole venue and mechanism by which the party's presidential and vice presidential nominees are determined. Rather than arrive with delegate slates earned in binding state primaries and caucuses the months before Libertarian candidates show up vie for scarce space on the debate stage then endure however many rounds of voting it takes (lowest candidate lopped off after each round) among the 1000 or so delegates in attendance until someone wins 50.1 percent of the vote.But then COVID-19 hit.""We are evaluating all of our contingency plans"" Libertarian National Chair Nicholas Sarwark told Reason Friday. ""There's a range of options that range from if we don't have a convention at all then the national committee remains in place for another two-year term…and the vice presidential and presidential nominees would be chosen by the national committee…[to] the opposite end of the spectrum [which] is somehow the curve gets flattened and bent and Texas becomes a safe haven for uninfected people or whatever and we all just show up in Austin in a room with a thousand people packed closely together just like we were always planning.""""I think both of those extremes at the ends are not likely outcomes.""So what are the contingencies in between? The Libertarian National Committee (LNC) is scheduled to discuss precisely that a special meeting conducted via Zoom Thursday night at 9 p.m. ET. Sarwark reckons that some kind of remote meeting or an Austin plus remote hybrid might be set up with a pared-down agenda focusing mainly on candidate selections both for the presidential ticket and the LNC.The convention website on March 19 informed delegates ""The Coronavirus crisis is of an incredibly fluid nature and as of the writing of this 61 days before our event it is still too early to make any 'permanent' plans…Expect more definitive guidance as to the plan for the event about one month before the delegates and attendees are scheduled to arrive for registration and credentialing. For now we can expect release of more definitive guidance on 4/20.""Added Sarwark: ""Basically the convention oversight committee meets weekly with updates and is in constant contact with the venue and then they give me updates at a slightly lower periodicity. We're looking at probably somewhere around 30 days out maybe three weeks out to make a final decision.""There have been seven nonbinding Libertarian primaries and caucuses thus far with longtime libertarian intellectual Jacob Hornberger getting the most votes among human contenders in five and political satirist Vermin Supreme in the other two. (Because we're talking about Libertarians ""None of the Above"" received the most votes in the North Carolina primary and ""no preference"" won in Massachusetts where there was also a 23 percent chunk of write-in candidates that have not to my knowledge been tabulated.)In the overall popular vote thus far according to this Wikipedia page Hornberger leads Supreme 22 to 10 percent with 1996 L.P. vice presidential nominee Jo Jorgensen just behind with 9 percent.The rolling shutdowns across the country—postponing primaries and most large gatherings—alter the basic calculus for winning delegate votes which is usually: Show up to state conventions glad-hand and perform in debates. ""That's when I do most of my sales if you will"" Vermin Supreme told Reason Saturday. ""And conversions and convincing the skeptical and the questioning and the people who don't know me other than the meme although you would think they would by now but it seems that's often not the case. So that is certainly affecting the campaign strategy.""The L.P.'s presidential nominating process can be a lengthy event filled with horse-trading and intrigue. Since the goal is to win a majority of delegates on-site and since the L.P. is a threadbare operation based on much volunteer work and self-financing candidates have in prior cycles invested much energy into making sure friendly state delegates show up. Canceling or significantly physically altering the Austin gathering will certainly upend business as usual for America's third party.Still Sarwark says ""We're trying to model [responsible] behavior in our party so that the American people can see that that is the sort of leadership we would bring to the White House should they choose to not select the Hobson's choice between a malignant liar and a familiar figurehead."""

The mood on the left following former Vice President Joe Biden's besting of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.) in Tuesday's primaries is one of defiance and scorn about the way the most establishment candidate pretty much always wins in Democratic Party politics. Many are rejecting the idea that it's now their duty to vote for Biden and are pledging not to back Biden should he get the party's nomination which now seems very likely.""We don't want to be overly dramatic but it does seem as if the writing is on the wall for Sanders's campaign after tonight"" wrote Sarah Frostenson at FiveThirtyEight shortly after midnight. ""And that's because if he was going to mount a comeback he needed to start tonight.

Washington state has still not been called.With 1991 Democratic Party delegates declared overall as of 9:30 a.m. this morning Biden has 846 and Sanders 683 according to the Associated Press.

225,America's Two Major Political Parties Are Melting Down. But the Two-Party System Remains Strong.,ERIC BOEHM ,Reason,1,https://reason.com/2020/02/19/americas-two-major-political-parties-are-melting-down-but-the-two-party-system-remains-strong/,"It is tempting to point and laugh—or at least chuckle a little bit—at the current sad state of America's two largest political parties.One has been consumed by a cult of personality built around a man who holds few of the ideological principles that until recently defined Republicanism. The other if current odds are to believed is heading towards a presidential nominating convention that will either crown a self-described socialist (who is not an actual member of the party) or descend into total chaos.At this moment national polls suggest that the most viable alternative to Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) promised revolution is the insurgent candidacy of another outsider: former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg who may accurately be called a DINO—that's ""Democrat-in-name-only"" to repurpose a tea party era slur from the other side of the aisle.Bloomberg is a billionaire—you know the class of people whom Democrats have spent the last several years demagoguing against—with a history of supporting racist police tactics donating to Republicans and being downright Trumpian in his disregard for the rule of law as New York Times columnist Ross Douthat highlighted last week.Nothing is settled yet of course but it seems increasingly likely that the two-party system will produce a 2020 presidential general election featuring a rich Democrat-turned-Republican from New York City who admires authoritarians and has a long history of making disparaging remarks towards women running against a super-rich Republican-turned-Democrat from New York City who admires authoritarians and has a long history of making disparaging remarks towards women.Or we could have the socialist who says having choices is overrated.So yes it is easy to throw one's hands up and laugh at this selection of candidates. It is easier still to laugh at the failures of the supposed mainstream candidates who were supposed to stop them—the Marco Rubios Ted Cruzes Joe Bidens and Elizabeth Warrens of the political world all of whom spent years working their way through their respective party's system only to be bigfooted out of the way by a populist authoritarian of one variety or another.If you're a libertarian independent or anyone else who operates outside and around the two major parties this might seem like good news; like the two-party system is finally losing its grip on American politics.But don't mistake the collapse of America's two preeminent political parties for the collapse of the two-party system itself. The latter is certainly welcome. But the former could easily lead us into a nightmare scenario where populism rules both parties and alternatives remain effectively sidelined by structural barriers erected during a previous era.To understand why it helps to first understand what's happened to the Republican and Democratic parties in the past few years. As political scientists from Yale Marquette and elsewhere have been noting for a while both major parties are relatively weak right now—that is the party structures have less influence over their presidential nominating processes than they historically have.There are many examples of how political parties have become more small-d democratic in recent decades but perhaps the most relevant is the way that the large-d Democratic Party changed its rules after 2016. This year Democratic Party insiders who play a role at the party's convention (colloquially referred to as ""superdelegates"") will not be allowed to vote on the first ballot in Milwaukee.In other words having just watched a political outsider hijack the Republican Party and having narrowly escaped Sanders' surprise insurrection against Hillary Clinton—which was prevented in part by the influence of the superdelegates—the Democratic Party decided that the right thing to do was….make it easier for an outsider candidate to smash his way into the party.Not being a partisan I don't have much interest whether the internal apparatus of the Republican Party or Democratic Party is strong or weak. As Reason editor at large Nick Gillespie has approvingly noted Trump and Sanders are burning the traditional Republican and Democratic establishments to the ground. Good riddance to them.But what I'd hope to see from the hollowing out of the two major parties is the creation of an environment where a greater set of political ideas can flourish. That so far at least has not happened.Even though both parties are weakening internally they remain externally strong. Thanks to decades of self-serving rulemaking the two major parties will continue to have a stranglehold on power long after they've been hollowed out by the populists.Just look at what happened when populism in the form of Trumpism invaded the GOP. The result has been a more bizarre form of political conformity in which allegiance to Trump's views and defense of his personal interests come before all else. Principled Republicans have mostly been forced out of the party or sidelined to a significant degree.There's no reason to think the outcome of a populist takeover of the Democratic Party would be much different. And that I suspect is part of the reason why longtime establishment figures on the left like James Carville are freaking out about the prospect of a Sanders nomination.Upending the two-party system has not created fertile ground for a greater range of political viewpoints to compete in elections. Instead of destroying the political gatekeepers we've merely handed the keys to the populists.There's been no groundswell of support for say reforming ballot access laws to let third parties have a more fair shot. The practical and structural barriers to the creation of new and different political parties remain roughly as sturdy as ever and the media continues to cover politics as a two-way zero-sum game which only reinforces the idea that the only factions who matter are the ones currently controlling Team Red or Team Blue.Indeed if the two-party system itself was collapsing Bloomberg would have entered the race as an independent. He's flirted with that idea for years. But when he finally decided to toss his hat into the ring it made more sense—even for the 9th richest man in the world—to try to hijack the name branding and built-in advantages of one of the existing major parties.When it comes to policymaking the populist takeover doesn't seem to be accomplishing much good. Trump's version of the Republican Party has jettisoned whatever fiscal conservativism it might have possessed and has become increasingly hostile to the free movement of goods and people around the world. A Democratic Party with Sanders at the helm would try to run deficits to even higher highs and might be even more hostile to trade.And no populist administration is going to tackle the entitlement programs that are the biggest driver of America's long-term budget issues because doing so would be quite unpopular.Instead of a broadening of political perspectives we're already running full speed into a 2020 election cycle that will recycle the same tired arguments that force voters into a binary choice—""if you don't vote for Trump you're helping elect Sanders!"" The only difference is that both choices might be populist authoritarians this time around.In short whether Trump or Bloomberg have an ""R"" or a ""D"" next to their names hardly matters—all that matters it seems is that they have one of those letters."
226,Does South Park Encourage Political Apathy and Moral Superiority?,NICK GILLESPIE ,Reason,1,https://reason.com/2020/02/18/does-south-park-encourage-political-apathy-and-moral-superiority/,"Last week the long-running and iconoclastic cartoon South Park got dragged yet again this time for allegedly teaching ""a generation of boys…that it was always cooler to be reactionary and contrarian and anyone who criticizes anything is 'offended' and that's the *real* problem."" A Twitter thread started by novelist podcaster and TV writer Dana Schwartz caught enough buzz to get trending on the micro-blogging site. It's worth pausing over her critique since it reflects past attacks and more importantly is fundamentally wrong in its substance.Far from inculcating moral nihilism and a shallow ""pox on both your houses"" mentality South Park traffics in a smart skepticism toward power in all of its manifestations and provides over two decades worth of lessons on how to be a decent tolerant smart and funny human being despite living in a world that is casually brutal disgusting and indifferent to suffering (watch the 2001 episode ""Scott Tenorman Must Die"" a version of Seneca's horrific Thyestes if you have any doubt).Dana Schwartz✔@DanaSchwartzzzIn retrospect it seems impossible to overstate the cultural damage done by SOUTH PARK the show that portrayed earnestness as the only sin and taught that mockery is the ultimate inoculation against all criticism44.3K2:12 PM - Feb 13 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy15.4K people are talking about thisDana Schwartz✔@DanaSchwartzzz · Feb 14 2020Replying to @DanaSchwartzzzMy point was that South Park seemed to teach that it was always cooler to be reactionary and contrarian and anyone who criticizes anything is “offended” and that’s the *real* problem. Wonder if that’s the message these fans absorbed....View image on TwitterView image on TwitterView image on TwitterDana Schwartz✔@DanaSchwartzzzPeople saying “they make fun of everyone!!!” — that is my point. South Park IS a political show but one whose message is: both sides are equally terrible so the only correct thing to do is nothing while mocking it all from your position of intellectual superiority.277212:34 PM - Feb 14 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy720 people are talking about thisSchwartz argues that South Park traffics in moral relativism or perhaps a form of ideological nihilism because she believes its core message is ""the only correct thing is to do nothing."" In her tweets on the topic she admits in passing that she hasn't ""been watching the show in recent seasons"" which helps to explain why her critique is so wide of the mark.In the early days of the show critics were already deriding the show as ""dangerous to democracy"" and ""vile trash"" that poisoned young viewers' minds. But as Barry Fagin wrote back in 2000 for Reason the show was ""loaded with moral content"" and taught his then-10 and 12 years old kids valuable lessons including ""it's good to make fun of people who believe stupid things"" ""it's good to make fun of hypocrisy"" and ""things that happen in cartoons aren't real.""That last point was particularly important in the 1990s when both liberals and conservatives were desperately trying to control the information explosion that came along with cable television and the internet. By representing the need for critical consumption of both expertise and information South Park like other shows that helped define the '90s (think The Simpsons Beavis and Butt-Head and Mystery Science Theater 3000) helped to develop media literacy in millions of viewers.I'd go further still and underscore that South Park teaches at least three basic lessons in virtually every episode. The first is that people in authority need to earn our respect rather than assume it. The second is that cultural moral and political diversity is both the real state of nature and can only be sustained through honest and open discussion about our differences. The third is that personal responsibility is the key to a flourishing society and the foundation of positive communal action. These points are summarized in this brief video from 2013:At one point in her tweetstorm about South Park Schwartz writes ""To be clear I don't blame the show itself as much as I do the generation of boys who internalized it into their personalities. Which maybe isn't the show's fault!"" There's no question audiences have a mind of their own and consumers of a given text routinely (and legitimately) interpret that text in ways that confound its creator's intentions. So it's possible that rather than create an audience that is smarter and more skeptical of information and power South Park has instead simply created an army of douchebros who act more like Cartman rather than Stan or Kyle. But since South Park first aired back in 1997 the country has become vastly more tolerant toward all sorts of marginalized people and causes and no view of the show could miss what side its creators are on when it comes to out-groups ranging from immigrants to trans people to Mormons. We may indeed be more vulgar as a society but we're also generally more tolerant and engaged too (the youth vote for the 2018 midterms was the highest in decades). South Park might not deserve much or even any of the credit but it doesn't deserve any of the blame either."
227,Judge Napolitano on the Politics of Impeachment,NICK GILLESPIE,Reason,1,https://reason.com/2020/02/15/judge-napolitano-on-the-politics-of-impeachment/,"In two decades at the nation's largest cable network Fox News analyst Andrew Napolitano has provided an unapologetically libertarian critique of state power regardless of the party holding control in the nation's capital. In the past several months he has also emerged as one of President Donald Trump's harshest critics claiming in May 2019 that the Mueller Report demonstrated that the president had clearly obstructed justice.Though he has said he thinks recent House hearings provided sufficient grounds for impeachment the former New Jersey Superior Court judge sees an even bigger problem in how the federal executive continues to arrogate power to itself. ""No American president in the post–Woodrow Wilson era has stayed within the confines of the Constitution"" Napolitano says. ""And each president has more authority than his predecessors for the simple reason that Democratic Congresses give power to Democratic presidents and Republican Congresses give power to Republican presidents.""Napolitano spoke to Reason's Nick Gillespie shortly before the House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump on two counts in December.Q: What is the case that Donald Trump committed impeachable offenses?A: We have to start this conversation by underscoring the fact that impeachment is not legal. It is political right? There's a phrase in the Constitution that says the House of Representatives shall have the sole—that's s-o-l-e—power of impeachment. Another phrase in the Constitution says each house of Congress shall write its own rules. Those rules don't even have to be fair as long as they generate the support of the majority.Q: Is this just a flex by Congress: ""We hate Trump; we've wanted to unseat him from the beginning; all we have to do is get a majority of members""?A: Blame that on James Madison not on [California Democratic congressman] Adam Schiff. That's the procedure.Q: What do you make of the argument that Trump obstructed justice?A: Because the House can write its own rules—which means it can say that the investigating committee has subpoena power—and because there are no defenses except those which come from the Constitution the president cannot interfere with the investigation of himself without risking the obstruction of justice charge. So when [President Bill] Clinton said to his secretary Betty Currie ""Don't tell [the grand jury about my relationship with Monica Lewinsky]"" and she did anyway Clinton was charged with obstruction—because the attempt at obstruction doesn't have to succeed; it only has to be articulated.Q: How do you feel about this in other kinds of legal proceedings? The FBI we know can talk to you for hours in hopes of tripping you up and then charging you with obstruction.A: This is why you should never talk to the FBI even if you're in the right. You're asking me if this is ""just"" from a moral perspective or [you're asking] if it's constitutional? It's absolutely constitutional. Is impeachment just from the moral perspective? Probably not.Q: Has Trump overstepped the bounds that the executive branch should be held to?A: The evidence of his impeachable behavior at this point in my view is overwhelming. But being an ex-judge being a lawyer I have to withhold judgment until a defense is presented. The defense would have to come out of the mouths of people who've refused to testify: Vice President Mike Pence Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and the president himself.Q: Are we in a constitutional crisis?A: I don't think we are in a constitutional crisis. We would get to one if the president were removed from office and refused to leave.You could argue there's a mini constitutional crisis when the House demands something and the White House refuses to present it. That's why we have a judiciary but neither side wants to go to the judiciary because both sides want this over with so they can get into the 2020 political season.Q: What happens if this goes to the judiciary and one of the sides refuses to abide by the ruling?A: Nixon famously refused to surrender his White House tapes. The case went to the Supreme Court which unanimously ordered in United States v. Nixon that he had to surrender the tapes. Then Nixon resigned.So if the Court were to order President Trump to surrender documents and he were to refuse that would be a constitutional crisis.This interview has been condensed and edited for style and clarity.

228,Only Tulsi Gabbard Wants to Decriminalize Sex Work but Other Dems Show Signs of Progress on the Issue,ELIZABETH NOLAN BROWN ,Reason,1,https://reason.com/2020/02/10/only-tulsi-gabbard-wants-to-decriminalize-sex-work-but-other-dems-show-signs-of-progress-on-the-issue/,"A majority of Americans now favor ""removing criminal penalties for adults to sell and pay for consensual sex"" with support particularly high among Democrats and younger voters but also crossing party and age lines. Yet most of the Democrats running for president prefer to keep quiet about sex work issues and only one remaining candidate—Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D–Hawaii)—has publicly expressed support for decriminalizing prostitution.""If a consenting adult wants to engage in sex work that is their right and it should not be a crime"" Gabbard said in a statement this weekend to Reason. ""All people should have autonomy over their bodies and their labor.""Gabbard is the only one to get a good grade on a recent report card put out by the group Decriminalize Sex Work (DSW). ""Gabbard supports the full decriminalization of sex work which removes criminal and civil penalties from adults engaged in consensual acts of prostitution"" the group reports.DSW gave Gabbard an A-. She didn't get a perfect score because she voted for FOSTA which made hosting content that facilitates prostitution a federal crime. FOSTA and the federal war on websites like Backpage have made sex work more dangerous and made it harder for police to find people who do need help according to preliminary evidence. All of the Democratic presidential candidates in Congress voted for FOSTA with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar signing on a co-sponsor of the Senate companion bill (SESTA) as did former presidential candidates Kamala Harris Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand.Recently though Rep. Ro Khanna (D–Calif.) introduced legislation that he sees as a potential first step to FOSTA's repeal—and the bill's Senate companion was introduced by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.) with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.) as a co-sponsor. (Ron Wyden of Oregon the only Democrat in the Senate to vote against FOSTA in the first place is also a co-sponsor.)""As lawmakers we are responsible for examining unintended consequences of all legislation and that includes any impact SESTA-FOSTA may have had on the ability of sex workers to protect themselves from physical or financial abuse"" said Warren in December when the SAFE SEX Workers Study Act was introduced.Warren tweeted last July that she's ""open to decriminalization"" of prostitution. But she's also fond of financial regulations that make it harder for people in sex workers (even in legal industries) to get bank accounts or use online payment processors.DSW gave Warren a C+ and Sanders a C the same grade given to Pete Buttigieg.The former South Bend Indiana mayor has made few statements about the issue. (His campaign did not respond to Reason's request for comment.) He told Out magazine in May 2019 that he was ""not ready to make policy news on this yet."" But he also sounded at least amendable to changing in a sex-worker-rights-friendly direction some day.""We now understand that [FOSTA] harmed vulnerable people"" Buttigieg told Out last year. ""This needs to be part of a larger conversation about how we treat sex workers and all of the reasons why this society hesitates to embrace the idea of sex work. I don't think all of those ideas are wrong.""That candidates are routinely being asked about sex work this election is itself noteworthy. ""In the last campaign cycle there were not candidates talking about sex work"" says Melissa Sontag Broudo general counsel for Decriminaize Sex Work and co-founder of the Sharmus Outlaw Advocacy and Rights Institute.""Just to see this conversation happening on this level is I think huge"" she adds.""It's the first time sex work has become an issue in a presidential election—that's historic"" says Bella Robinson who has been doing sex work for more than three decades and leads the Rhode Island chapter of Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics. After FOSTA passed Robinson's group worked with the Sex Workers Outreach Project to study the effect on sex workers. (See highlights from their research here.)Robinson is wary of proposals like the Warren and Sanders-sponsored sex work study bill and accuses the candidates of merely paying ""lip service"" to sex worker rights. ""I agree we could use more research"" she says. ""But why would we trust the government?""Robinson's group has tried to reach out to the Warren and Sanders campaigns with little luck she tells me.Broudo and others at Decriminalize Sex Work attempted to talk with someone on the campaign of all of the remaining Democratic candidates though some were more receptive than others. ""Repeated attempts to contact [Andrew] Yang's campaign went unanswered"" according to Kaytlin Bailey communications director for Decriminalize Sex Work. The same went for Joe Biden's campaign. (Yang's team responded to me promptly but only to say he has no comment.)One campaign that did respond to the group was Klobuchar's and the representative was polite and seemed open to hearing them out according to Broudo. She says she considers even open-mindedness from candidates like Klobuchar something of a success and ""a pretty big signal"" that the conversation around sex work is shifting.Klobuchar has a history of spouting crazy sex-trafficking myths and backing the bad policies that stem from them. She now ""appears to support the Suppression Model"" says the Decriminalize Sex Work report card (which gives her D+) as does Yang (who got a D).The Suppression Model is also known as partial criminalization the Nordic Model the Swedish Model and—in a recent rebranding attempt—the Equality Model. Under this approach prostitution is still a crime and paying for sex still totally illegal but offering paid sex in certain circumstances is not.The idea has become popular among European feminists and well-funded U.S. advocacy groups. But public health and human rights organizations—including Amnesty International and the World Health Organization—tend to favor full decriminalization.Decriminalization differs from legalization the prostitution regulatory scheme seen in some European countries and in a few counties in Nevada. Legalization refers to a scheme where prostitution is permitted in limited and highly regulated circumstances but exchanging sex for something of value outside these circumstances will still get you thrown in jail.The method most of the U.S. abides by now is full criminalization in which paying for or offering paid sexual services is a criminalized along with a host of otherwise legal activities if they're done in service of a sex worker.Mike Bloomberg who enthusiastically embraced full criminalization during his time as mayor of New York City was the only Democratic candidate given a failing grade on the DSW report card. ""Arrest rates for prostitution were 30% higher during Bloomberg's tenure as mayor"" the DSW report states citing data from the New York Division of Justice Services and noting that ""the spike in arrest rates almost exclusively targeted black New Yorkers.""Since prostitution is not a federal crime talking to presidential candidates about decriminalization may seem strange. But presidents pick federal justice officials and help set the tone for law enforcement priorities and the feds fund and incentivize a lot of local prostitution stings around the country. There are many ways a president could make a difference on sex worker rights and the enforcement of laws against them.Last summer Cristine Sardina director of the Desiree Alliance spent the month of July in Iowa talking to Democratic candidates about issues including criminal justice reform immigration and sex worker rights. ""I saw most of them at various rallies private homes and bars/restaurants"" she tells me in an email.Sardina also made a fact sheet titled ""Consensual Sex Work Versus Sex Trafficking"" and ""presented it to most of their interns or the candidate directly. The interns were mostly young and all grasped the idea of [sex work] decrim enthusiastically"" she writes. ""Now if we could only get the candidates to say that."""
229,Michael Bloomberg and the Imperious Presidency,MATT WELCH ,Reason,1,https://reason.com/2020/02/07/michael-bloomberg-and-the-imperious-presidency-2/,"If Donald Trump could shoot somebody in the middle of Fifth Avenue and get away with it what brazenness might we expect from his fellow septuagenarian Manhattanite presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg?The then–mayoral candidate gave us a glimpse back in 2001 when he was dumping his first tranche of $74 million into a late-in-life political career and a reporter asked him whether he had ever smoked marijuana. ""You bet I did"" the media mogul enthused at a time when politicians tended to be much more reticent about such things. ""And I enjoyed it.""Talk about do as I say not as I did. During Bloomberg's three terms as mayor the Big Apple became the marijuana arrest capital of the world thanks to the notorious stop-and-frisk searches conducted largely in neighborhoods where billionaires rarely venture.Hizzoner's conscience has never been noticeably troubled by such obvious disparities under the law. If anything the disproportionate impact of his policy preferences on poorer folk has been the point.In an April 2018 conversation with Christine Lagarde then the managing director of the International Monetary Fund Bloomberg defended his fondness for taxing treats such as sugary sodas and trans fats that are mostly enjoyed by the non-rich.""Some people say well taxes are regressive"" he said. ""But in this case yes they are! That's the good thing about them because the problem is in people that don't have a lot of money. And so higher taxes should have a bigger impact on their behavior and how they deal with themselves….The question is do you want to pander to those people or do you want to get them to live longer?""Rules may be important for ""those people"" but are much less so for the eighth-richest man on the planet. He is the leading financier of gun control advocacy in America—and one of the few people allowed to have an armed security detail in Bermuda. He has been positively Trumpian about releasing his tax returns snapping at the mere suggestion that such political traditions should apply to him. And as recently as January 2019 even as the rest of the Democratic Party was finally evolving toward getting rid of federal prohibitions on the marijuana Bloomberg once enjoyed the former mayor called pot legalization ""perhaps the stupidest thing we've ever done.""If George W. Bush and Barack Obama ushered in the return of the imperial presidency Trump represents a further devolution toward the imperious presidency. There was an audacity in Obama's pen and phone and there was an expansive theory of executive branch autonomy spearheaded by former Vice President Dick Cheney. Trump's contribution has been more vulgar more direct more New York: ""I dare you to stop me"" mixed with ""I can say anything I want.""Bloomberg's manners are more refined but only just. There's the locker room talk about women which he pre-emptively apologized for in advance of his presidential run. Trump may troll people about seeking a legally proscribed third term but Bloomberg actually went there changing New York City law near the end of his second mayoral term in order to run for a third and then switching it back soon after winning. As The New York Times noted dryly upon the latter occasion ""Bloomberg thinks that being able to serve three terms in office is a good idea—just not for anyone else.""Bloomberg's above-the-law demeanor might seem preferable to Trump's appetite for corruption but their approaches to how the law applies to the lowly are distressingly similar. To Trump constitutional limits to executive power are speed bumps slowing down his policy goals especially concerning immigration. To Bloomberg policy ends can justify means that judges have explicitly ruled unconstitutional. ""I think people the voters want low crime"" he told the Times in September 2018 defending the practice of stop and frisk. ""They don't want kids to kill each other.""It seems implausible that in an era of resurgent Democratic populism primary voters will reward the kind of bluenose who has appeared in skits as ""King Michael."" But seeing Bloomberg even in fifth place extends a worrying trend. We've stacked up so much power at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue that billionaires with insatiable ambitions are eyeing the address greedily and finding market share among understandably disgruntled voters.""The president"" lawyer Alan Dershowitz said on Fox News host Laura Ingraham's show last year ""has the power that kings have never had."" Until we start denuding the Oval Office we will continue getting the royals we deserve."
230,The Topeka School,PETER SUDERMAN ,Reason,1,https://reason.com/2020/02/07/the-topeka-school/,Donald Trump is mentioned only briefly in Ben Lerner's novel The Topeka School but the president and the world he has come to define looms over the plot. It's the story of Trump in sotto voce.Set mostly in the late 1990s amid the hypercompetitive world of high school debate the book attempts to locate the roots of today's political moment—including and especially Trump the alt-right and the country's coastal/flyover partisan-geographical divide—in the psychological alienation and dislocated male rage of Clinton-era middle America.Much of the story is quasi-autobiographical and Lerner is remarkably effective at capturing the oddly specific culture of the pre-9/11 high-school debate circuit. If there's a flaw it's diffusion: The novel struggles to contain its sprawling story and perspectives.Lerner's personal experience and poetic sensibility imbue The Topeka School with a sense of distance and trauma. Trump was always looming the book seems to say always present in our lives the inevitable consequence of our politics and our culture. We just didn't know it
231,Working After the Coronavirus,The Editorial Board,The Wall Street Journal Opinion,1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/working-after-the-coronavirus-11585265032?mod=opinion_lead_pos1,So much for full employment. That ended this month with the attack of the coronavirus and Thursday’s record spike of three million new jobless claims. Millions more will follow in the coming weeks and the goal of public policy should be to get them back to work as soon as possible—not to keep them on the government’s unemployment tab.That point may seem obvious but you wouldn’t know it from this week’s flap over the enhanced jobless benefits in the Senate’s $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. The bill increases unemployment benefits for all workers by $600 per week for the next four months. Even the liberal Economic Policy Institute says this expansion would provide a “100% replacement of wage income for the bottom half of the workforce.” Some will earn more by not working.Republican Senators Ben Sasse Lindsey Graham Tim Scott and Rick Scott warned that this might hurt small employers in their states by encouraging workers to stay at home for longer. Speaker Nancy Pelosi called them “cruel”—the word is her version of Donald Trump’s “incredible”—and the media echoed her.The Senators are right if you know anything about labor markets and incentives to work. Jobless benefits are administered by the states each of which sets its own eligibility requirements and payment levels. Benefits are typically based on a worker’s prior earnings and limited to between 50% and 70% of a state’s average weekly wage. The maximum benefit runs up to $823 in Massachusetts while the minimum is as low as $10 in Louisiana for low-earners.The current economic crisis is like no other because government has literally forced hundreds of thousands of businesses to shut down. And because so many workers are likely to lose their jobs more generous benefits will cushion the short-term blow. But the goal should be returning people to private payrolls when the crisis passes and the risk is that benefits at 100% of wages for the long term will do the opposite and slow the recovery.The blunt Democratic solution which Republicans too easily agreed to as a price of the bill is to give all laid-off workers a $600 benefit increase on top of their normal unemployment compensation for up to four months. So workers will now make at least $15 an hour (assuming a 40-hour workweek) and as much as $35 an hour in places like Massachusetts—for not working.Amazon Walmart CVS and delivery services are seeking to hire hundreds of thousands of workers to meet a surge in demand even as the virus spreads. Many are boosting pay but how are they supposed to compete with workers who can stay at home and make more?The experience after the 2008-2009 recession is instructive. Congress repeatedly extended unemployment benefits which expire after 26 weeks in most states to up to 99 weeks until December 2013. The national jobless rate stayed high far longer than in a typical recovery and the incentive not to work is one reason.The economic evidence on this incentive point isn’t controversial or partisan. In March 2010 economists at the liberal Brookings Institution reported that jobless insurance extensions “correspond to between 0.7 and 1.8 percentage points of the 5.5 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate witnessed in the current recession.”The enhanced benefits expire after four months but we’ll bet Speaker Pelosi’s pension that Democrats will be back demanding an extension through the end of the year and calling Republicans “cruel” if they disagree. America needs an economic recovery from the virus recession that is faster and stronger than the last expansion. That means helping laid-off workers for the short term rather than providing a reason not to return to work.
232,Florida’s Governor Dissents on Lockdowns,The Editorial Board,The Wall Street Journal Opinion,1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/floridas-governor-dissents-on-lockdowns-11585264913?mod=opinion_lead_pos2,The coronavirus outbreak has reminded Americans that we live in a federal system. Despite the press fixation on Washington state governments set many of the policies that most affect daily life. Governors in hard-hit regions have seen their political profiles surge and many are issuing shelter-in-place orders.Democrats are now targeting Ron DeSantis Florida’s Republican Governor for charting a slightly different course. “While other large states continue to take strong urgent and sweeping action to stop the spread of Covid-19 Florida has not” Joe Biden said this week. “I urge Governor DeSantis to let the experts speak to the public and explain why this is the case.”Mr. DeSantis has ordered the closure of Florida restaurants and other gathering places. He has also required quarantines for people arriving by air from the New York City region and urged seniors to stay at home. Florida schools are closed at least through mid-April.Yet Mr. DeSantis has stopped short of declaring a statewide lockdown or closing all non-essential businesses. Instead local governments have flexibility and major cities like Miami and Orlando are imposing more draconian policies like those in effect in New York and California. In less densely populated Florida areas there are fewer restrictions.Mr. DeSantis has said he’s worried about the social and economic impact of a lockdown on his state. The number of Floridians applying for unemployment benefits increased more than tenfold this week. Meanwhile Florida has 2355 confirmed cases of coronavirus. That’s the eighth most nationwide but more than half are in the greater Miami area where officials have issued more severe restrictions than Mr. DeSantis has ordered statewide. Florida’s large size also means it has fewer confirmed cases per capita than the country as a whole.Yet a progressive consensus is forming that there is no room for differences in the intensity of coronavirus mitigation. Democrats and the media are increasingly casting the caution of politicians like Mr. DeSantis as conservative disdain for expert knowledge. It’s almost as if they don’t want Florida or Texas to try something different that could turn out better.The truth is that it may be useful for states to try different models. The virus won’t be eradicated in the coming weeks and the U.S. will need flexibility. That might include more targeted stay-at-home policies like those Mr. DeSantis is attempting as well as better hygiene testing and personal protective gear. Once testing is more widespread the U.S. may be able to tailor mitigation measures by region with stricter measures in hot zones than outside them—and perhaps regulations on travel like Florida’s quarantine on travelers from New York.Already we have seen the way the virus’s center of gravity can move rapidly. Seattle began as the outbreak’s epicenter but data from the Washington Free Beacon’s Charles Lehman shows the West Coast is currently facing a significantly slower spread than the besieged tristate region on the East Coast.Lockdowns are an important tool but they are not without significant costs. Perhaps Florida’s mitigation efforts will fail and it will face a major outbreak requiring a statewide order. But governors and local leaders often know their constituents’ needs best and they are politically accountable. Federalism has always been an American strength and it may be key to the next phase of virus containment.
233,The Robert Levinson Abdication,The Editorial Board,The Wall Street Journal Opinion,1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-robert-levinson-abdication-11585264816?mod=opinion_lead_pos3,Bob Levinson deserved better from the country he served so faithfully. The former FBI agent went missing in Iran in 2007 making him the longest-held American hostage. His family had long clung to hope—they received a video in 2010 and photos in 2011—but this week announced they now believe he is dead.In a statement his wife and children put it this way: “We recently received information from U.S. officials that has led both them and us to conclude that our wonderful husband and father died while in Iranian custody. We don’t know when or how he died only that it was prior to the Covid-19 pandemic.”The statement thanked President Trump his national security team and various Senators “who have done all they could to make our family whole again.” Though the President later said at a press conference that he still isn’t convinced Levinson is dead the family was plainly persuaded by the intelligence they received.It is a tragic end to a terrible story. Initially U.S. officials told the American people Levinson had been on a private business trip. Later we learned he’d been dispatched to Iran by CIA analysts who had no authority to do so. Perhaps most disgraceful was the Obama Administration’s decision to conclude its nuclear deal with Tehran without bringing Levinson home or at least resolving the case—at the moment America had the most leverage.Iran has taken many American hostages. But Bob Levinson was taken prisoner while on a mission to gather intelligence in a dangerous country. Let’s hope those who pressed hardest for his return continue to insist on a final and full public accounting—from our own government as well as from Iran.
234,Indicting the Caracas Mob,The Editorial Board,The Wall Street Journal Opinion,1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/indicting-the-caracas-mob-11585264638?mod=opinion_lead_pos4,The world isn’t stopping because of the coronavirus and on Thursday the U.S. escalated its pressure on the thugs running Venezuela. This raises the stakes for dictator Nicolás Maduro and his Cuban backers who continue to oppress Venezuelans even as the virus may spread to Latin America.The Justice Department indicted Mr. Maduro and four of his lieutenants on charges related to drug-trafficking money laundering and corruption. It also indicted two leaders of the terrorist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia—FARC—who signed a supposed peace agreement under the guidance of the Obama Administration in 2016 but are alleged to be in cahoots with the Venezuelans who are also charged with narco-terrorism.The U.S. has offered a $15 million reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Mr. Maduro and $12 million for Diosdado Cabello head of the dictatorship’s constituent assembly. Mr. Cabello sued this newspaper in U.S. federal court for libel in 2016 for reporting that he was under Justice investigation on suspicion of drug-trafficking and money-laundering. In 2017 a judge dismissed the case.The indictments come more than a year after the U.S. recognized Venezuelan interim President Juan Guaidó and as Venezuelan oil is fetching $10-$15 a barrel in international markets. Mr. Maduro whose term expired in January 2019 and was not legitimately re-elected has refused to allow new elections. The economy has crumbled and 4.5 million Venezuelans have fled the country creating a migration crisis in South America.Mr. Maduro increasingly relies on Cuba’s intelligence services for security and organized crime for income. The Justice Department alleges that the heart of all this is the Cartel of the Suns a drug-trafficking operation named for sun-shaped stars on the uniforms of military and headed by Mr. Maduro.“The scope and magnitude of the drug trafficking alleged” U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said Thursday “was made possible only because Maduro and others corrupted the institutions of Venezuela and provided political and military protection for the rampant narco-terrorism crimes described in our charges.”Most drug-trafficking is done for profit and Mr. Berman alleged that “the defendants betrayed the Venezuelan people and corrupted Venezuelan institutions to line their pockets with drug money.” He also alleged that “Maduro and the other defendants expressly intended to flood the United States with cocaine in order to undermine the health and wellbeing of our nation. Maduro very deliberately deployed cocaine as a weapon.”The U.S. rarely indicts heads of state not least because they can become more reluctant to leave power. But the indictment means Mr. Maduro can be arrested anywhere for trial in America and sends an important signal to the people of Venezuela that the U.S. supports its democratic aspirations.
235,The Restaurant at the Edge of the Coronavirus Pandemic,Tunku Varadarajan,The Wall Street Journal Opinion,1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-restaurant-at-the-edge-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic-11585324962?mod=opinion_lead_pos5,Omar Popal apologizes mid-call: “Sorry I have to take a telephone order.” His sister Fatima Popal stays on the line. “We’ve had just 12 orders all day” she says. This last one is for leek dumplings—made from a family recipe—and lamb pilaf around $25 for the till. It’s nearly 6 p.m. on March 22. What should have been a swamped (and satisfying) Sunday at Lapis—an Afghan bistro in the Adams Morgan neighborhood of Washington—has been instead a fiasco.On the first Sunday in March this year by comparison Lapis seated 120 people for brunch and 150 for dinner. With the ban on in-house dining in Washington the restaurant—like tens of thousands across the country—has switched to a bare-bones takeout-only service. Omar handles the customers’ calls and Fatima the kitchen though their real jobs are COO and CFO respectively of the Popal Group their family business which also owns a French restaurant and a German beer hall in the capital.“Lapis serves the food we eat at home. It’s our pride” says Omar. As of this writing their French and German joints are closed. Lapis “will most probably be at less than 25%” Fatima says “at the rate we are going.” Their three restaurants she adds have “laid off pretty much everyone except for our salaried employees” including their bread-maker. “He used to run a bakery in Afghanistan. He’s an elderly gentleman. We don’t want to expose him to anything so he hasn’t come in.”The Popals had 75 people working for them before the new coronavirus struck. Now they have seven: four chefs and three managers. Their mother Shamim is the executive chef at Lapis but she no longer comes in to work. “We’ve quarantined my parents” Omar says. (Shamim is 65 and their father Zubair 69.) “My mother kept coming in here and the last day she was here was very emotional for her.”She has been sending her children instructions from home but the crisis is proving unfathomable. “We have no idea what to expect” Fatima says when asked how they’re planning to cope. “We don’t understand the volume of business that’s coming in. Do we buy groceries? Are we going to be closed in the next day or two?”The Pashtun Popal family has faced—and overcome—adversity before. They fled Afghanistan in 1980 when it looked certain that Zubair would be jailed by the Moscow-backed Communist regime that ran the country at the time. He worked as a manager at Kabul’s Intercontinental Hotel—an American company. “Plus he wasn’t attending any of the education meetings of the regime” Omar says. The family was cosmopolitan in the way of many educated Afghans of that era. The mother Omar says “wore miniskirts when she was young. My aunt wore black for a week when Elvis Presley died.”The family bounced around as refugees between Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates. In 1987 they secured political asylum in the U.S. Zubair no longer a hotel manager worked as a salesman at a Honda dealership in Arlington Va. Life was hard but dignified. Both Omar and Fatima went to George Washington University. She got a master’s degree from Georgetown he from the London School of Economics. They opened their first restaurant a French bistro in 2003 and started Lapis—named after the semiprecious blue stone found in Afghanistan—in 2015.“Each dish is my mom’s own recipe” Fatima says “and she makes sure everything is healthy.” This isn’t filial hype as this writer can testify from personal experience. The food is delicious and distinctively nongreasy for Afghan cuisine with more vegetables than you would expect on the menu of a carnivorous culture. “Vegan Afghan” might seem an oxymoron but Fatima assures me that they do brisk business with young vegan Washingtonians. Traditional eaters get what they want too and Omar boasts of an ambassador from a “prominent Islamic country” who dines on lamb—with his booze served in a teacup.Those happy days now seem part of a lost age and Omar and Fatima are stressed. “There’s a lot happening in addition to figuring out the financial side of what the business is doing.” The siblings have to provide emotional support for the laid-off staff many of them immigrants from El Salvador Serbia and Afghanistan. Then there are the pressing physical questions. “Do we have the symptoms or not?” Fatima asks. “Is somebody sick and doesn’t know it?”Yet in the midst of a global crisis that is crushing their small business in a corner of Washington the Popals take solace in their own history. Omar is tenacious—and philosophical. “I would say the fact that we were refugees and that we came from nothing makes us a little bit more resilient. Because you know we understand what it means to go back to nothing.”
236,Old Age Is a Bummer for the Baby Boomers,Michael Medved,The Wall Street Journal Opinion,1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/old-age-is-a-bummer-for-the-baby-boomers-11585324904?mod=opinion_lead_pos6,The uncomfortable collision of a perilous pandemic and a boisterous battle for the presidency conveys an unwelcome but unmistakable message to aging baby boomers. The generation that has dominated pop culture and politics for nearly a half-century that has loomed in the national consciousness as perpetually pre-eminent may not be so ageless and invincible after all.Joe Biden (who’ll turn 78 before Inauguration Day) and Donald J. Trump (who’ll be 74) would be the two oldest people ever nominated for the presidency by a major party. And it isn’t only the two survivors of the arduous selection process who demonstrate the graying of our politics. Mr. Biden’s most durable Democratic rivals—Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren and Michael Bloomberg—are all septuagenarians.All of these grizzled geezers also qualify as prime targets for Covid-19 which seems to focus its most virulent ravages almost exclusively on those who’ve passed the age of threescore and 10. American voters like to believe that robust indestructible chief executives will properly protect them from the world’s dangers but in the current situation it’s the candidates themselves who seem especially vulnerable threatened by coronavirus. If we do make it to November with no health breakdowns for either of the aged electioneers it will still constitute the end of an era—a “Last Hurrah” in the spirit of a marvelous nostalgic 1956 novel about a political warhorse in his final campaign.However this plot plays out whether Mr. Trump proceeds to a second term or Mr. Biden manages to seize his place it’s virtually inconceivable that we’ll ever again elect a president born in the 1940s. Boomers (and pre-boomers like Mr. Biden who arrived less than three years before the end of World War II) won’t be shuffled offstage altogether but they won’t capture starring roles for the future or hold the spotlight that our generation traditionally demanded.From the beginning the postwar baby-boom cohort always received disproportionate attention for the simple reason that there were so many of us: Some 76 million were born during the period of fertility and mounting prosperity from 1946 through 1964. When we were toddlers and mischievous tykes the public delighted in newspaper cartoons depicting our misadventures—think of “Peanuts” (launched in 1950) and “Dennis the Menace” (1951). “Leave It to Beaver” (a television smash hit between 1957-63) took us a bit further in our childhood journeys.As we entered our adolescent years the term “teenager” suddenly entered the popular lexicon while the rest of the nation puzzled over our exotic tastes in music (The Beatles acid rock) hair (“flow it show it long as God can grow it”) and cosmopolitan clothing (why bell bottoms or Nehru jackets?). At Woodstock fawning media accounts discerned the dawning of a new millennial age some 31 years before the actual millennium indulging our generational arrogance and self-regard. A year later Yale law professor Charles Reich published a bestseller called “The Greening of America” that hailed his students and their cohort for shaping a new world not based on what they created or even pursued but what they rejected: materialism militarism conformity.In recent years the “turn on tune in drop out” radicalism of the ’60s gave way to a notable pursuit of power. Two high school classes achieved the near-complete domination of American presidential politics with the seniors from the Class of ’64 (Bill Clinton George W. Bush Donald Trump) enjoying more conspicuous success than the hapless juniors of the Class of ’65 (Al Gore Mitt Romney Hillary Clinton).My 1976 book “What Really Happened to the Class of ’65?” probed the destructive disillusioning impact of the counterculture on members of my California high-school class looking back from the vantage point of our 10-year reunion. In speaking about the progress of this fabled favored generation in lectures and media appearances related to that book I often made the point that wherever we found ourselves in our peregrinations admirers would define our excesses as the very essence of stylish novelty so that somewhere around the year 2020 the world would consider it unspeakably hip to be fashionably ensconced in cutting-edge nursing homes.That punch line drew chuckles but the real-life suffering of boomers in board and care grievously afflicted by Covid-19 counts as no laughing matter.At the moment the bulk of ’60s survivors still shelter in place and hope for adequate supplies of toilet paper hand sanitizer and if necessary ventilators. None of it seems adventurous or sexy; instead of longing for brave new worlds most of us would settle for a fondly remembered bygone era—say the good old days of three months ago.Boomers will not of course go gentle into that good night disappearing before we play our own role in the longed-for return of the grand blessings of normal American life. We might even savor the last exercise of presidential power by one of our rough contemporaries whichever of the dueling old-timers wins the 2020 keys to the White House. But with brothers and sisters of the Woodstock family suddenly frail and vulnerable we can far more readily accept the patronizing smug disdain of “OK boomer” in place of the less palatable formulation—“Bye bye boomers”—that inevitably lies ahead.
237,Rationing Care Is a Surrender to Death,Allen C. Guelzo,The Wall Street Journal Opinion,1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/rationing-care-is-a-surrender-to-death-11585262558?mod=opinion_lead_pos7,The coronavirus has introduced terrifying terms into our everyday vocabulary—“social distancing” “ventilator” “pandemic.” Be prepared to add a new word to the vernacular: rationing.The U.S. has reported more than 80000 cases of Covid-19. About half are in New York and more than 10000 cases were reported in a single day. If projections by Cory Chivers a data scientist at the University of Pennsylvania Health System are correct those numbers represent 15% of all cases. American hospitals have only about 96000 intensive-care beds and an estimated 62000 full-featured ventilators to deal with the respiratory failure associated with severe coronavirus infections. (A further 12700 ventilators are in the Strategic National Stockpile.) Hospitals could soon be short of beds personnel and ventilators.That spells rationing. Demetre Daskalakis deputy commissioner for disease control at New York’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene warned on March 9 that hospitals will “have to think about triaging the use of ICU beds and ventilators” and that will require “making some very serious difficult decisions.”In Seattle state Health Department officials and health-industry professionals conferred last week on a “triage” plan that would decide who receives full care based on age health status and severity of illness. The rest would simply be given “comfort care.” Last week Susan Henderson executive director of the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund wrote a public letter to California Gov. Gavin Newsom to express worry that the state had also begun “discussion of ‘rationing’ medical care.”That authorities in some hard-pressed areas are considering rationing likely strikes most Americans as ghoulish. How for instance does a patient “qualify” for a ventilator? How old is too old? In 2014 Ezekiel Emanuel one of the architects of the Affordable Care Act and now an adviser to Joe Biden on coronavirus declared that 75 was long enough to live. After that people become “feeble ineffectual even pathetic.” But was Einstein? Verdi? Matisse? Or should the decision be based on health? Do we exclude a patient with multiple sclerosis? Or someone who is blind?The instinctive resistance people feel to these questions was illustrated in a series of public forums after the 2009 swine flu outbreak held by a faculty team from Johns Hopkins University. More than 300 participants were invited to weigh the possibilities of rationing. Lee Daugherty Biddison and Ruth Faden organizers of the forums recalled that participants rejected a simple first-come-first-serve model. Then they rejected a lottery system as too arbitrary. And they struggled to create an algorithm for rationing. In the end the participants asked why it wouldn’t be better simply to build more hospital rooms or manufacture more ventilators in advance.Then there are the legal questions raised by rationing. The Freedom of Conscience Defense Fund and the Thomas More Society have published a memorandum that warns health-care officials against violations of federal civil-rights law in cases of “discriminatory health care decisions.” The Age Discrimination Act of 1975 prohibits “discrimination on the basis of age in programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance.” The ban covers all activities of recipient institutions such as hospitals. Likewise the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as bluntly forbids excluding an “individual with a disability” from any service by a federally funded entity.And is this sudden reach for rationing even necessary? Many of the worst-case scenarios that prophesy millions of infections and a collapsing hospital system are predicated on doing nothing in the face of the coronavirus. Whether or not public-health officials think current social-distancing measures have been adequate the lockdowns have certainly been much more than nothing. There are also reasons to be optimistic about the availability of equipment. Beyond the 62000 full-featured ventilators U.S. health-care providers have another 98000 basic models and respiratory machines and the country has more manufacturers of ventilators than do hard-hit European peers.“We don’t want to do it. We don’t think we should have to do it” the CEO of the Washington State Hospital Association Cassie Sauer to the Seattle Times last week. But people have become too accustomed to taking the easy way out of dilemmas and too comfortable with making excuses for killing when the only offense of those we kill is the possibility of inconvenience. Americans are better than that. Ventilators are not simple to manufacture but neither were Spitfire fighter planes at the beginning of the Battle of Britain. Improvise innovate imagine.And when the cloud of this plague passes over as it surely will do not let the return of the light find us standing with upraised knives over our neighbors.
238,We Need to Know Who’s Developed Immunity to Coronavirus,Bill Cassidy and Christopher Mores,The Wall Street Journal Opinion,1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/we-need-to-know-whos-developed-immunity-to-coronavirus-11585262496?mod=opinion_lead_pos8,The Ebola virus spread rapidly in Sierra Leone in 2015 and killed many. One of us (Dr. Mores) was there and saw the local health-care system get overwhelmed. Without enough personal protective equipment doctors and nurses worked tirelessly always fearing infection. The economy was destroyed.Eventually Ebola was contained. The new coronavirus will also be contained. Everyone is looking forward to the end trying to figure a way out of the crisis. Social distancing reduces the virus’s ability to spread but until cures and vaccines are discovered the only way out is naturally occurring immunity.Both of us have experience documenting immunity. Sen. Cassidy is a gastroenterologist who founded an immunization program that protected 36000 children in Louisiana against hepatitis B. Dr. Mores followed patients in Sierra Leone who were immune to Ebola after recovery. Experience informs our ideas.Coronavirus spreads rapidly. One person typically infects two or three other people who then infect two or three others and so on. Most recover or never have symptoms and most likely become immune. A vaccine works by mimicking the immune response of a naturally occurring infection. Herd immunity develops when 40% to 70% of a population becomes immune. The “herd” of people who are immune blocks the virus from taking hold and infecting others. A person’s immunity to the novel coronavirus could last 12 months. By then a vaccine could be ready.When individual and herd immunity develop society and the economy will begin to return to normal. When a nurse knows that she is immune she can care for routine Covid-19 patients without wearing a respirator mask. An immune bartender can serve customers without fearing exposure. An immune insurance agent can have meetings without getting infected.In the U.K. officials pursued an initial strategy of allowing herd immunity to develop. When they realized that waves of Covid-19 patients would overwhelm National Health Service hospitals they abandoned the approach. A successful strategy combining herd immunity with social distancing for the vulnerable requires that the authorities know and record who is and isn’t immune.The U.S. has experience recording immunity. States currently use online immunization registries to estimate herd immunity for a variety of vaccine-preventable diseases. These registries were paid for by taxpayers and comply with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Doctors can enter information. Schools can look up student vaccination records.When Dr. Cassidy vaccinated 36000 children their records were added to Louisiana’s immunization registry. When Dr. Mores knew an African patient was immune to Ebola the patient was employed to relieve exhausted health-care workers. Increasing the number of immune people and knowing who is immune fundamentally changes things in a health crisis.To restart the economy the government needs to set up coronavirus-immunity registries. At the same time widespread testing is necessary to document immunity in those who haven’t fallen sick. A recent report from China found that 100% of patients tested two weeks after symptoms cleared had antibodies for the coronavirus. Recovering from a known coronavirus infection or having a positive antibody test is likely to indicate immunity lasting for at least some time. Those who so demonstrate that they are immune can be allowed to return to work. The whole community is freer when herd immunity is established.Healthy young people appear to be at lower risk of contracting Covid-19. This combined with herd immunity would allow children and college students to return to school. Any adult who is immune could safely teach. As herd immunity establishes itself the 30% of Americans who are under 25 could safely return to shops and restaurants.There’s obviously still much more we need to learn about the new coronavirus. What we learn may change how we respond. But our suggestions here are based on sound public-health principles to address the medical crisis. Only when we find a way out of the medical crisis can we find our way out of the economic crisis.
239,A Coronavirus Great Awakening?,Robert Nicholson,The Wall Street Journal Opinion,1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-coronavirus-great-awakening-11585262324?mod=opinion_lead_pos9,Could a plague of biblical proportions be America’s best hope for religious revival? As the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II approaches there is reason to think so.Three-quarters of a century has dimmed the memory of that gruesome conflict and its terrible consequences: tens of millions killed great cities bombed to rubble Europe and Asia stricken by hunger and poverty. Those who survived the war had to grapple with the kinds of profound questions that only arise in the aftermath of calamity. Gazing at the ruins from his window at Cambridge University British historian Herbert Butterfield chose to make sense of it by turning to the Hebrew Bible.“The power of the Old Testament teaching on history—perhaps the point at which the ancient Jews were most original breaking away from the religious thought of the other peoples around them—lay precisely in the region of truths which sprang from a reflection on catastrophe and cataclysm” Butterfield wrote in “Christianity and History” (1949). “It is almost impossible properly to appreciate the higher developments in the historical reflection of the Old Testament except in another age which has experienced (or has found itself confronted with) colossal cataclysm.”Americans chastened by the horrors of war turned to faith in search of truth and meaning. In the late 1940s Gallup surveys showed more than three-quarters of Americans were members of a house of worship compared with about half today. Congress added the words “under God” to the Pledge of Allegiance in 1954. Some would later call this a Third Great Awakening.Today the world faces another moment of cataclysm. Though less devastating than World War II the pandemic has remade everyday life and wrecked the global economy in a way that feels apocalyptic.The experience is new and disorienting. Life had been deceptively easy until now. Our ancestors’ lives by contrast were guaranteed to be short and painful. The lucky ones survived birth. The luckier ones made it past childhood. Only in the past 200 years has humanity truly taken off. We now float through an anomalous world of air conditioning 911 call centers acetaminophen and pocket-size computers containing nearly the sum of human knowledge. We reduced nature to “the shackled form of a conquered monster” as Joseph Conrad once put it and took control of our fate. God became irrelevant.Who will save us now that the monster has broken free?“Men may live to a great age in days of comparative quietness and peaceful progress without ever having come to grips with the universe without ever vividly realising the problems and the paradoxes with which human history so often confronts us” Butterfield wrote. “We of the twentieth century have been particularly spoiled; for the men of the Old Testament the ancient Greeks and all our ancestors down to the seventeenth century betray in their philosophy and their outlook a terrible awareness of the chanciness of human life and the precarious nature of man’s existence in this risky universe.”The past four years have been some of the most contentious and embarrassing in American history. Squabbling over trivialities has left the public frantic and divided oblivious to the transcendent. But the pandemic has humbled the country and opened millions of eyes to this risky universe once more.“Sheer grimness of suffering brings men sometimes into a profounder understanding of human destiny” Butterfield wrote. Sometimes “it is only by a cataclysm” he continued “that man can make his escape from the net which he has taken so much trouble to weave around himself.”For societies founded on the biblical tradition cataclysms need not mark the end. They are a call for repentance and revival. As the coronavirus pandemic subjects U.S. hospitals to a fearsome test Americans can find solace in the same place that Butterfield did. Great struggle can produce great clarity.“The ancient Hebrews by virtue of inner resources and unparalleled leadership turned their tragedy turned their very helplessness into one of the half-dozen creative moments in world history” Butterfield wrote. “It would seem that one of the clearest and most concrete of the facts of history is the fact that men of spiritual resources may not only redeem catastrophe but turn it into a grand creative moment.”Could a rogue virus lead to a grand creative moment in America’s history? Will Americans shaken by the reality of a risky universe rediscover the God who proclaimed himself sovereign over every catastrophe?
240,The Coronavirus Debt Threat,Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff,The Wall Street Journal Opinion,1,https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-coronavirus-debt-threat-11585262515?mod=opinion_lead_pos10,As the pandemic lockdown continues governments and central banks in the world’s largest economies are responding with stimulus programs aimed at limiting the damage while holding societies together. But as the paralysis persists and deepens the odds of a rapid “V-shaped” economic recovery are fast diminishing.Our 2009 book “This Time Is Different” documents financial crises over eight centuries. A central theme controversial at the time of the global financial crisis is that recessions that are accompanied by severe financial crises are deeper and recoveries slower than conventional “business cycle” recessions. Weakening financial-industry balance sheets and the inefficiencies associated with widespread default personal and corporate inflict severe damage on economic activity. This is often amplified by increased uncertainty and risk-aversion.The current collapse is poised to shatter records for crisis depth. Duration is still an open question.We have ranked crises since 1870 by severity combining the magnitude of the initial contraction with the time it took to return to the precrisis peak in per capita gross domestic product.At the moment even in a scenario of rapid recovery available data indicate that many countries—including the U.S.—are heading for contractions in the first half of 2020 that are unprecedented in the sheer depth of their “sudden stops” as measured by peak-to-trough declines in per capita GDP.Even a relatively quick exit from the economic standstill in China parts of Europe and the U.S. wouldn’t avert crises in many middle- and low-income countries—or a deep global recession. Economic growth had been falling in many emerging markets before the novel coronavirus emerged. External debt both private and public had continued to climb. For most countries central bank foreign-exchange reserves are significantly off their peaks. For many commodity producers repaying hard-currency debt mostly in dollars will be impossible as commodity prices flirt with historic lows and investors show more aversion to risk.For countries that don’t rely on commodity exports the situation is hardly better. The pandemic has bitten into global trade and all manner of manufacturing supply chains. For countries that depend on tourism the immediate prospects are especially grim. Private financing for emerging markets has come to a halt and multilateral government lenders such as the International Monetary Fund don’t have nearly the resources to fill the gap.As the pandemic continues to interrupt normal economic life around the world the number of countries at once facing an acute scarcity of financial resources and a health emergency will increase dramatically. In some of those cases emergency policies to cope with the pandemic will take priority over the repayment of debt. Defaults won’t be limited to private personal and corporate debt. Argentina Venezuela and Lebanon will soon have company.An urgent question is how to figure out the inevitable debt rescheduling that will be needed in many corners of the global economy. There have been calls for a debt moratorium for small businesses and homeowners in advanced economies. This makes sense. If the capacity to generate income is suspended while in lockdown debt repayments should also be placed on hold temporarily. As an emergency measure that lifts discretionary income and may limit lasting damage to individual and corporate credit scores such proposals can be integrated with stimulus policies.But the problem brewing outside the richest advanced economies must also be addressed. A comparable crisis-relief measure to deal with sovereigns hit by the pandemic needs to be worked out with the IMF and World Bank. The largest creditor for many of the world’s poorest countries is China which will also have to come to the table. Ecuador is a case in point. The country has among the highest coronavirus infection rates in Latin America and its revenue from oil exports has collapsed.If the economic paralysis extends too long advanced economies won’t be spared either. Consider Italy’s predicament. With a debilitating collapse in output limited fiscal capacity and a dire humanitarian problem is it really supposed to devote scarce resources to debt repayment instead of hospitals? Other countries in Europe may face the same dilemma. In Italy’s case the response is less clear-cut than for emerging markets as much of Italian debt is held by domestic residents not foreign investors.Our research has shown that heterodox solutions to unsustainable debt including debt forgiveness and restructuring have been widely practiced by both advanced and developing economies over the past two centuries. For the moment however the worst-hit households companies and governments need an outright moratorium.
241,House approves historic $2.2 trillion economic relief package,Susan Ferrechio,Washington Examiner,1,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/house-approves-historic-2-2-trillion-economic-relief-package,"The House approved a $2.2 trillion economic relief measure on Friday sending to President Trump’s desk a federal aid package of historic size and scope that responds to the drastic health and economic consequences caused by the coronavirus.The measure passed by voice vote after lawmakers defeated a move by Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky a Republican that would have required at least 216 lawmakers to appear in the chamber and take a roll-call vote.Massie opposed the scope and cost of the bill which when coupled with additional federal lending authority he said was ""not a good deal"" and would equate to providing $17000 per citizen. ""If this bill is so great for America why not allow a vote on it?"" Massie tweeted.Massie was outnumbered by dozens of lawmakers who came to the House floor to urge passage of the measure and faced public criticisms from President Trump who supports the bill and called Massie ""a third-rate grandstander."" Lawmakers gathered in the chamber and viewing galleries above in order to block Massie from winning the required support of one-fifth of those present to uphold his call for a recorded vote.Party leaders had to summon 216 lawmakers to the floor and gallery in order to constitute a quorum and defeat Massie's roll call demand. Speaker Nancy Pelosi a California Democrat had to eat up floor time as they waited for lawmakers to arrive.""Come on my colleagues to the gallery"" she said as she praised the legislation in a lengthy floor speech.Pelosi followed dozens of lawmakers who mostly stood in support of the massive bill.“This is the biggest economic and health crisis the country has ever faced” Rep. Rosa DeLauro a Connecticut Democrat said during a House floor debate that imposed social distancing rules mandatory hand sanitizing and limited access to the chamber. “This is the biggest governmental response the country has ever seen to rescue people the economy and our health care system. It is necessary.”The bill provides $1200 in direct cash payments to many individuals expanded unemployment insurance aid to small businesses and loans to help large companies including the airlines to keep operating during the economic downturn.The measure cleared Congress after days of bipartisan negotiations and talks with the Trump administration. The Senate passed the measure unanimously on Wednesday and now that it has won approval in the House Trump is expected to quickly sign it into law.The unprecedented cost and scope of the bill drew criticism from fiscal conservatives who pointed to spending in the measure they believe is unrelated to the coronavirus emergency.The House Freedom Caucus issued a statement declaring they had put forward their own economic relief proposal but the group stopped short of attempting to block passage of the measure on the floor.“The vote we take today may be the most monumental vote during our tenure in Congress” Rep. Andy Biggs an Arizona Republican and chairman of the Freedom Caucus said in a House floor speech. “The amount of money we’re committing is in itself epic.”Biggs pointed to funding allocated for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts public broadcasting the National Endowment for the Arts and the Education Department among other groups who received millions of dollars in aid.“These may be worthy or not but they certainly have no place in an economic relief package” Biggs said.The package prompted criticism from liberal Democrats who protested the inclusion of $500 billion in loans for the airlines hotels and other major industries who employ millions of people but have started laying off workers due to the stalled economy.The big companies must pay back the loans and the legislation will install an oversight board appointed by Congress and an inspector general to monitor the program.Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez a New York Democrat and leading House liberal condemned the massive loan program. She said the bill provided “crumbs” for workers.“The option is to let them suffer for nothing or allow this greed to contribute to the largest income inequality in our future” Ocasio-Cortez said. “There should be shame for what was fought for in this bill and the choices we have to make.”The massive spending measure is the third federal aid bill passed by Congress this month to respond to the coronavirus outbreak.Earlier this month lawmakers passed an $8.3 billion measure and a $103 billion package to help workers heathcare facilities and small businesses including the provision of free testing for the virus.The House and Senate now stand adjourned for regular business for the foreseeable future but will hold ""pro forma"" sessions. The Senate is not scheduled to return for business until April 20.Speaker Nancy Pelosi a California Democrat said she is beginning to draft a fourth round of federal aid that would expand family leave provide more aid to states and local governments increase food stamp payments and help bolster pension funds."
242,'We're going to have to dramatically cut': Cuomo faults Congress for lack of aid in pandemic package,Cassidy Morrison,Washington Examiner,1,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/were-going-to-have-to-dramatically-cut-cuomo-faults-congress-for-lack-of-aid-in-pandemic-package,"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday that he would have to implement major cuts to the state budget because of the lack of aid from Congress.""We have no state revenues to speak of. We're going to have to dramatically cut our state expenses. You can't spend that which you don't have"" Cuomo said in a press conference.New York the state hardest hit by the coronavirus outbreak with about 44600 people testing positive for the virus has lost $10 billion to $15 billion in revenue Cuomo said. The massive $2.2 trillion stimulus package likely to arrive on President Trump's desk this weekend does not allocate enough funding to the state to make up for the losses he said.""The federal government only gave us $5 billion and that's only for coronavirus expenses"" Cuomo said. ""We have a $10-15 billion hole. The federal government gave us zero nada niente zilch.""He added that the state will likely have to cut education aid its largest expense. In fact Chalkbeat reported that New York City spends $28808 per student on average every year. The federal government Cuomo said has not stepped in to help bolster education funding.New York state schools have already shut down and were scheduled to open Wednesday. Cuomo extended that timeline further Friday announcing they would remain closed until April 15 at the earliest as the outbreak has not improved much since he made the initial announcement earlier this month that schools would be temporarily shuttered. He also waived the requirement that schools teach 180 days out of the year."
243,Thomas Massie's forced coronavirus vote is irresponsible, Kaylee McGhee,Washington Examiner,1,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/thomas-massies-forced-vote-on-the-coronavirus-relief-bill-is-irresponsible,The House was expected to pass a $2 trillion relief package Friday morning to ease the economic burden that has resulted from the coronavirus pandemic. But Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie may have just delayed that relief from reaching businesses and families.Massie announced Friday morning that he would defy GOP leadership and request a roll-call vote on the relief package which means that if 216 lawmakers are not physically present in the House to vote on the measure the relief package will remain at a standstill until quorum is reached. While New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez also considered blocking the bill it seemed set to pass quickly on Friday until Massie announced his intervention.This roll-call vote is irresponsible for several reasons the most obvious being that it forces representatives to abandon isolation and group together in direct violation of health officials’ social distancing guidelines. Some representatives have tested positive for COVID-19 and others have remained self-quarantined out of respect for their other colleagues.Massie is now callously undermining the caution this pandemic demands.Massie’s objection to the relief package is understandable. He disagrees with the unnecessary irrelevant pork that legislators managed to hide within it such as the $25 million allocated to the Kennedy Center grants for the National Endowment for the Humanities and Arts and more.People should be rightly frustrated with this unnecessary spending. But forcing the House to reach a quorum is not the way to express that frustration especially since the bill is going to pass anyway. Instead Massie has only increased uncertainty for small businesses that are suffering and for the record number of people who have already filed for unemployment. If Congress does not provide them financial relief and hope the economy will suffer even more.The coronavirus relief bill is not perfect. It might not even be good. But it is better than nothing. And given a choice most people would prefer inadequate help to no help at all.

Haley Stevens shouted at colleagues on Thursday even as she was ruled out of order. Steven's voice grew louder despite House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer's attempts to give her more time to finish speaking.“Sharing in the profession with those who have not come before you!” Stevens said. “Similar times of trying medical need wars and flus past you will see darkness. You will be pushed and our society needs you to stand together at this time! Our country loves you! To our doctors and our nurses I wear these latex gloves to tell every American to not be afraid.”At times during her explosive speech other members of the House attempted to shout Stevens down but she kept speaking as the gavel punctuated her out-of-procedure action.The Senate passed the $2.2 trillion relief package late Wednesday. The House is expected to pass the legislation on Friday which would send it to President Trump's desk.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned the $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief package for allocating only ""crumbs"" to most people.The House is expected to pass the coronavirus economic aid package on Friday. It would give most people $1200 increase unemployment payments and provide funds to small businesses and corporations affected by the virus. Yet in the run-up to a vote Ocasio-Cortez called the funding package ""shameful"" for providing $500 billion in loans for corporations.""What did the Senate majority fight for? One of the largest corporate bailouts with as few strings as possible in American history. Shameful. The greed of that fight is wrong for crumbs for our families"" the Democratic congresswoman said.""And the option that we have is to either let them suffer with nothing or to allow this greed and billions of dollars which will be leveraged into trillions of dollars to contribute to the largest income inequality gap in our future. There should be shame about what was fought for in this bill and the choices that we have to make"" she added.Ocasio-Cortez threatened to block a voice vote that is slated to take place on Friday which would require that all members return to Congress to vote for the measure. Although her actions could delay the relief package from passing she noted that she is fearful the situation in New York could spread if action isn't taken soon.""I represent one of the hardest-hit communities in the hardest-hit city in this country: Queens New York. Thirteen dead in a night in Elmhurst Hospital alone"" she said. ""Our community's reality is this country's future if we don't do anything. Hospitals workers do not have protective equipment. We don't have the necessary ventilators and but we have to go into this vote eyes wide open.""As of Friday morning New York had more than 37000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus with 385 related deaths."

Thomas Massie of Kentucky opposes the spending relief package which he has deemed too costly and wasteful. He returned to Washington D.C. to ensure lawmakers register their support or opposition through a roll-call vote.""This stimulus should go straight to the people rather than being funneled through banks and corporations like this bill is doing"" Massie said on Twitter Friday announcing his plan to request a recorded vote.The House is expected to pass the measure although it is not clear how many lawmakers are in the Capitol to vote electronically in the House chamber. Many avoided returning to Capitol Hill because of the threat of spreading the coronavirus. Some could not find a flight now that the airlines have canceled many routes due to the economic slowdown.A quorum technically required to pass legislation is currently 216 lawmakers but it would only be required if a lawmaker insists on calling one.House officials on Thursday put plans in place in the event of a roll-call vote to ensure social distancing guidelines.Lawmakers have been divided into 15 groups that will be summoned at different times to avoid overcrowding the chamber. During a typical roll-call vote the chamber is packed with members and staff.Massie who is described as a libertarian said the bill is “not a good deal” and when coupled with the $4 trillion in additional federal lending capacity equates to providing $17000 for every citizen.Trump who is eager to sign the economic relief package bashed Massie on Twitter ahead of the vote calling him “a third-rate grandstander.”Massie has in the past insisted on roll-call votes for big spending packages and so have other House fiscal conservatives including Rep. Chip Roy of Texas. Roy who was not able to make it to Washington on Friday defended Massie on Twitter.""@RepThomasMassie is one of the most principled men in Congress & loves his country. He is defending the Constitution today by requiring a quorum. There’s nothing 3rd rate about that @realDonaldTrump. I may miss vote if he forces roll call (flights) but it will pass. Back off"" he said."

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez blamed Republicans in Congress for adding measures to the coronavirus relief package that “cut checks off the backs of taxpaying immigrants” and accused them of “inhumane” corporate welfare.“To clarify $1200 checks are ONLY going to some w/social sec numbers NOT immigrants w/ tax IDs (ITINs)” the New York Democrat tweeted on Thursday. “Thanks to GOP these checks will be cut off the backs of *taxpaying immigrants* who get nothing. Many are essential workers who pay more taxes than Amazon. Wall St gets $4T”“What Trump + Senate GOP have done is hold hospitals working people and the vulnerable hostage so they could get in $500 billion (that will be leveraged into $4T) in corporate welfare” she added. “Without the Wall St giveaway GOP refuses to fund hospitals & unemployment. It’s inhumane.”House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also said Republicans worked to pack the bill with giveaways to corporations but defended the legislation that was unanimously passed by the Senate Wednesday night and is being taken up by the lower chamber on Friday.“It went from a corporate first proposal that the Republicans put forth in the Senate to a workers first Democratic workers first legislation” Pelosi said on Thursday. “The bill that was passed in the Senate last night and that we will take up tomorrow is about mitigation. Mitigation for all the loss that we have in our economy while still addressing the emergency health needs that we have in our country.”Democrats too faced criticism for provisions that made their way into the $2 trillion relief package including $350 million in funding for ""migration and refugee assistance.""“Much of this money will be spent on illegal immigrants in the United States and foreign migrants around the world” Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz told Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar during a Twitter exchange regarding the funding. “Neither of those groups are Americans. This does not belong in a relief package for American workers and businesses.”"
248,John Kerry sides with Trump: GOP congressman has 'tested positive for being an asshole',Caitlin Yilek,Washington Examiner,1,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/john-kerry-sides-with-trump-gop-congressman-has-tested-positive-for-being-an-asshole,"Former Secretary of State John Kerry backed President Trump’s criticism of a House Republican over a threat to delay a vote on an economic relief package to address the fallout from the coronavirus.“Breaking news: Congressman Massie has tested positive for being an asshole. He must be quarantined to prevent the spread of his massive stupidity” Kerry tweeted Friday referring to Rep. Thomas Massie.Kerry also shared Trump’s tweet disparaging the Kentucky congressman as “a third rate Grandstander.”Trump appeared to relish Kerry's comments tweeting back: ""Never knew John Kerry had such a good sense of humor! Very impressed!""Massie a libertarian-leaning Republican tweeted the constitutional requirement for a quorum on Thursday which requires at least half of the members present. If no one calls for a quorum it is assumed one exists. But Massie's request for a roll-call vote and a quorum would force other House members self-isolating to stop the spread of the coronavirus to come back to Washington for a vote and delay passage of the package by hours or days.Because of Massie's threat many members decided to travel to Washington when they would have otherwise stayed home to prevent the spread of the respiratory disease."
249,Coronavirus relief package contains $600B in tax cuts,Nihal Krishan,Washington Examiner,1,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/coronavirus-relief-package-contains-600-billion-in-tax-cuts,The coronavirus relief package going through Congress currently includes almost $600 billion in tax cuts over the next decade according to a new analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation.The JCT a nonpartisan committee within Congress showed in a report Thursday that the coronavirus legislation will cause a massive drop in tax receipts for the federal government this year of over $700 billion or a 20% reduction. Receipts will fall another $254 billion in 2021 before rising again in 2022.A majority of the $600 billion comes from tax breaks within the bill such as one allowing companies to delay paying payroll taxes. JCT's analysis showed businesses using this measure to delay paying $350 billion in payroll taxes over the next two years. Most of this will get paid back to the government in the coming years.The most expensive tax item in the legislation is the provision to send millions of people a direct cash payment worth $1200 for every adult and $500 for each child. This will cost approximately $292 billion. A measure to give companies the payroll tax grant for keeping their workers employed would cost another $54.5 billion.Another part of the bill which would cost approximately $200 billion allows companies to qualify for a refund by applying their current losses to the previous year's taxes.The U.S. federal budget deficit currently exceeds $1 trillion and isn't expected to decrease anytime soon.The Congressional Budget Office another nonpartisan entity that calculates the cost of legislation has not released its budget estimate of the relief package yet.The bill was approved on Wednesday night in the Senate and is expected to be voted on in the House on Friday. President Trump is expected to sign it into law early next week.
250,Beware the dangers of mail-in elections,Dave Lowry,Washington Examiner,1,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/op-eds/beware-the-dangers-of-mail-in-elections,"The recent cancellation of the Ohio primary vote should be a wake-up call. If the 2020 general election were scheduled for tomorrow the number of absentee ballots would be massive. Social distancing would require it. Nationwide county election offices would be overwhelmed. As a nation we are not ready for that. Should we be? Unfortunately most folks believe that by November today’s social distancing requirements will be a thing of the past. But will they? Uncertainty prevails.America’s ability to conduct a fair and honest election is imperative. If the next general election requires most votes to be cast absentee then there is reason to be concerned about the validity of the results. In the 2000 general election (George W. Bush vs. Al Gore) my absentee ballot vote was not counted by the Broward County Supervisor of Elections (Miriam Oliphant) even though my ballot arrived on time as verified by UPS tracking.My ballot was fraudulently stamped as received nine days late. In 2004 the Florida Elections Commission validated my claim and sent a letter to Brenda Snipes (Broward County Supervisor of Elections) asking her to count my vote in the official tally for that prior election. Brenda Snipes never responded to the letter. To date my ballot has never been opened or counted.So as we have seen in the past county election officials can manipulate the final totals by deciding which ballots to count and which ballots to mark ""late."" They have access to voter rolls. If you are party-affiliated they know it. It would be an easy task to separate the ballots by party and decide which ones to count. They did not count my ballot in 2000 and they might decide not to count your ballot in 2020.But this is just one way county officials can rig the outcome. Many counties currently have more registered voters on their rolls than they should. That leaves the system wide open for potential abuse. Judicial Watch has been successful in getting some states to clean up their voter rolls but much more remains to be done.If we act now the federal government and state governors could begin to provide the resources every county needs to expand their capability to conduct a general election entirely by absentee ballot. Officials also need to scrub their voter rolls and purge the names of folks who have died or moved out of state. Voters registered in more than one state should correct the error themselves or their right to vote should be suspended until it is corrected. Our ability to hold a fair and honest election is at stake.If you do vote by absentee ballot in the 2020 general election here’s some advice: Don’t use regular mail. Regular mail has no tracking system. Use certified mail. It will cost you about $4 but at least you’ll know that an unscrupulous election official will hesitate to stamp it “late” because you will be able to prove when it was delivered.Dave Lowry a retired colonel is a 30-year Army veteran with two master's degrees.

251,Calls grow for an investigation into China's initial efforts to cover up coronavirus spread,Lauren Meier,The Washington Times,1,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/27/calls-grow-investigation-chinas-initial-efforts-co/,Calls on Capitol Hill are mounting for the State Department to investigate China’s alleged efforts to cover up the initial spread of the coronavirus outbreak that has swept the world killing thousands in its wake.In a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday Rep. Michael McCaul the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee is urging the department to consider launching a multilateral investigation with other democratic countries to look into any moves to cover up the coronavirus spread which began in the Wuhan province in China last November.“By causing a local outbreak to become a pandemic their system which is designed to censor anything that could be a threat to the regime is putting millions of American lives at risk” the Texas Republican wrote.The U.S. has the most confirmed cases of coronavirus than any other country in the world according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker as of Friday with more than 1300 deaths from the virus.Mr. McCaul claims China has launched a disinformation campaign about the virus “in an attempt to transfer blame to the United States and that is exacerbating this dire situation.“The State Department has demonstrated considerable flexibility and ingenuity in refuting CCP’s various lies and I urge you and your team to continue these efforts and to coordinate with willing allies” he continued.Earlier this week Mr. Pompeo criticized “the disinformation campaign that the Chinese Communist Party is engaged in to try to deflect from what has really taken place here.”The ranking member was not alone Friday in his claims that China has moved to cover up the virus’ severity.A pair of Republicans on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unveiled legislation that would call on China to publicly state there is no evidence that COVID-19 the disease caused by the new coronavirus originated anywhere else but China and condemns the government’s censorship of doctors and journalists during the early days of the outbreak.“Chinese officials destroyed early COVID-19 test kits suppressed information and refused international assistance” Sen. Marcia Blackburn Tennessee Republican said. “The Communist Party is so petrified of the truth that they kicked out journalists and fabricated a story of where the virus originated.”“The Chinese Communist Party wasted precious weeks on a cynical coverup instead of containing the China virus at its epicenter” Sen. Tom Cotton Arkansas Republican added. “Our first priority after protecting Americans must be holding China accountable for unleashing this plague on the world.”President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping earlier Friday pledged in a phone call to cooperate in the battle against the coronavirus a sign of easing tensions between the two nations.“Just finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China” Mr. Trump tweeted.“Discussed in great detail the CoronaVirus that is ravaging large parts of our Planet. China has been through much & has developed a strong understanding of the Virus. We are working closely together. Much respect!”Mr. Trump has refrained in recent days using the phrase “Chinese virus” to describe the outbreak that originated in Wuhan. He told Fox News he would stop using the term but didn’t regret it noting that China blamed U.S. soldiers for starting the pandemic.
252,Trump slams GM says it wanted 'top dollar' for ventilators,Tom Howell Jr.,The Washington Times,1,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/27/trump-slams-gm-says-it-wanted-top-dollar-ventilato/,President Trump said Friday the federal government bought ventilators from “some wonderful companies” even as he threatened to wield war-production powers against General Motors saying he’s unhappy with automaker’s efforts and demands amid the coronavirus crisis.Mr. Trump will announce the companies and the number of ventilators later Friday. The machines which help people breathe are vital to the coronavirus response since the virus causes respiratory distress.New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and other governors have pleaded with Mr. Trump to find and ship more ventilators to their hospitals saying it’s too difficult for them to find them on the open market.he president on Friday blamed GM for some of the hiccups.GM previously agreed to produce ventilators with Ventec Life Systems Inc. as automakers refocus their production capability toward the crisis.The New York Times reported the administration pulled back from purchasing tens of thousands of the machines after the price tag came in at $1 billion. The paper said the deal might still happen but the Federal Emergency Management Agency wanted to shop around.Mr. Trump said he might force GM to make the machines through the Defense Production Act a Korean War-era law that allows the president to compel production from private industries.The president says GM scaled back the terms of the agreement.“They said they were going to give us 40000 much needed Ventilators ‘very quickly’” Mr. Trump tweeted. “Now they are saying it will only be 6000 in late April and they want top dollar. Always a mess with Mary B. Invoke ‘P.’”Mr. Trump who was referring to GM CEO Mary T. Barra later explained that “P” meant the production act.The Washington Times has sought comment from GM about the status of the deal.Mr. Trump in his series of tweets said GM “MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio or some other plant and START MAKING VENTILATORS NOW!!!!!!”GM no longer owns the Lordstown plant. It sold the plant to Workhorse which makes electric trucks.Mr. Trump trumpeted the sale on Twitter at the time.Also Friday Mr. Trump said he delivered thousands of ventilators to New York only for the state to place them in storage.Melissa DeRosa a top Cuomo aide said the ventilators arrived Wednesday and are being deployed to hospitals as they need them.“We don’t know which hospitals will have the need yet — this is evolving in real time” she tweeted.She said the federal government gave New York 2000 ventilators but they need 30000.“We have to be smart about what we have & be able to move on a dime” she wrote. “Lives are at stake.”

Adam Smith Washington Democrat and ranking member Mac Thornberry Texas Republican have repeatedly insisted the crafting process of the massive National Defense Authorization Act would not be sidelined despite having most of Congress’ focus on the spread of the coronavirus outbreak across the country.“As the nation grapples with the COVID-19 crisis the Committee continues to adhere to the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the Sergeant at Arms and the House Attending Physician” Mr. Smith and Mr. Thornberry said in a statement.The procedural move — which outlines requests from the Pentagon and will later be replaced with formal language — marks the starting point for the committee to formulate the must-pass legislation that effectively dictates the administration’s defense policy for the upcoming year.The panel is expected to consider the bill next month with a full House vote in May. But increased attention on coronavirus-related legislation paired with heightened precautions that are being taken on Capitol Hill to prevent the spread among lawmakers could force a delay.“During this time of uncertainty the Committee remains focused on completing the FY21 NDAA and performing rigorous oversight through formal communications and teleconferences” the members said “which can and will be accomplished while protecting the health of our members and staff.”

Very impressed!” Mr. Trump tweeted.Mr. Massie says he has well-founded concerns about the bill and the Senate process for approving it.“The Senate did some voodoo just like with Obamacare. Took a House Bill (HR 748) dealing with taxes stripped every word and put their bill in it. The House is just as responsible for killing the origination clause as the Senate. It’s the House’s job to reject the process” Mr. Massie tweeted.Fellow conservatives rallied to his defense with one telling Mr. Trump to “back off.”“He is defending the Constitution today by requiring a quorum. There’s nothing 3rd rate about that [Mr. Trump]” Rep. Chip Roy Texas Republican tweeted. “I may miss vote if he forces roll call (flights) but it will pass. Back off.”Rep.

That period is nearing an end.The coronavirus outbreak has disrupted lives for millions of Americans as governors and local leaders have imposed their own stay-at-home orders and business closings.There are now more than 86000 coronavirus cases in the U.S. — the most of any country in the world - and more than 1300 coronavirus-related deaths according to a Johns Hopkins University tracker.The Labor Department on Thursday reported that there were more than 3.2 million initial jobless claims for the week ending March 21 shattering records.
256,Lawmakers racing back to D.C. to vote on $2.2T coronavirus rescue plan after lone Republican objects,Dave Boyer ,The Washington Times,1,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/27/lawmakers-racing-back-dc-vote-22t-coronavirus-resc/,House lawmakers from across the country were scrambling to get back to Washington Friday morning in time for a possible roll-call vote on a $2.2 trillion economic rescue package after a Republican lawmaker threatened to block leaders’ plans to hold an informal voice vote.House leadership began advising lawmakers on Thursday night to return to Washington from their districts if possible because they anticipate that Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky could call for a roll-call vote on the package that was approved by the Senate earlier this week.Leaders in both parties were pushing for a voice vote which does not require most members to be present to minimize the health risk for lawmakers who would need to travel long distances to vote in person. It would take only one lawmaker to object to a voice vote.Mr. Massie on Thursday tweeted his concerns about the bill and the Senate process for approving it.“The senate did some voodoo just like with Obamacare. Took a House Bill (HR 748) dealing with taxes stripped every word and put their bill in it. The House is just as responsible for killing the origination clause as the Senate. It’s the House’s job to reject the process” Mr. Massie tweeted.Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez New York Democrat also has threatened to force a roll-call vote citing her concerns that the legislation favors corporations.“With the health risks of travel there is no easy choice here” she told CNN on Wednesday. “But essential workers are showing up and putting their health at risk every day and if the final text of a bill is set up to hurt them it may be something we have to do.”Rep. Kevin Brady Texas Republican tweeted at Ms. Ocasio-Cortez sarcastically “Yes @AOC do it. Go ahead - delay a House vote. Block help for the worker at a closed plant. The single mom laid off. The server w/no hours. The teetering local business. The family w/CV-19. Reveal to America YOUR socialism: cruel gov’t control that cares only for itself.”President Trump on Thursday said he expected the House to swiftly pass the measure so he can sign it immediately but he acknowledged that one lawmaker could delay it.“There could be one grandstander maybe” Mr. Trump said. “You might have one grandstander. And for that we will have to come back and take a little more time. But it will pass. It’ll just take a little longer. But let’s see whether or not we have a grandstander.”The president slammed Mr. Massie in a tweet Friday morning saying the Kentucky congressman was inadvertently aiding the Democrats.“He is a disaster for America and for the Great State of Kentucky!” Mr. Trump tweeted.In a radio interview on Thursday Mr. Massie said he plans to vote against the package which includes direct payments of $1200 to most taxpayers $500 billion in loans for distressed corporations and $367 billion in job-retention loans for small businesses.“If it were just about helping people to get more unemployment [benefits] to get through this calamity that frankly the governors have wrought on the people then I could be for it” Mr. Massie said on KRC radio in Kentucky. “But this is $2 trillion. Divide $2 trillion by 350 million people — it’s almost $6000 for every man woman and child. I’m talking about spending. This won’t go to the men women and children. So if you have a family of five this spending bill represents $30000 of additional U.S. national debt because there is no plan to pay for it.”Mr. Massie who voted in favor of the first $8.3 billion coronavirus aid measure said the House shouldn’t hold an informal voice vote on such an expensive package.“I’m having a really hard time with this. Because they’re saying ‘Well it’s hard to travel yadda yadda yadda’ ” Mr. Massie said. “Well [Wednesday] night 96 out of 100 senators voted. All we would need is 218 out of 435 to vote. I know there are people saying ‘Oh you gotta vote for it. You can’t slow this down.’ Meanwhile they spent a week in the Senate arguing how much money should go to the Kennedy Center.”The Kennedy Center would receive $25 million under the bill an expense that President Trump said he supports.“So many are trying to get their pork in this bill!” Mr. Massie tweeted this week.His threat to derail the voice vote was infuriating some colleagues.“Dear @RepThomasMassie: If you intend to delay passage of the #coronavirus relief bill [Friday] morning please advise your 428 colleagues RIGHT NOW so we can book flights and expend ~$200000 in taxpayer money to counter your principled but terribly misguided stunt” tweeted Rep. Dean Phillips Minnesota Democrat.
257,Dems use coronavirus crisis to prod for reversal of ban on aborted fetal tissue research,Valerie Richardson ,The Washington Times,1,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/26/jerry-nadler-seeks-aborted-fetal-tissue-research-b/,The Trump administration’s ban on aborted human fetal tissue in federally funded research has come under renewed fire as Democrats and pro-choice advocates accuse the White House of hampering the search for coronavirus cures.House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler New York Democrat called on the administration to lift the “illogical and harmful” restrictions citing a report about a National Institutes of Health immunologist who has sought an exemption for his COVID-19 research.Mr. Nadler said the Department of Health and Human Services “must authorize this research immediately and while the ban on fetal tissue research should be lifted permanently at the very least it must be lifted during this pandemic.“That the Trump Administration prioritizes their illogical and harmful anti-science agenda over stopping this pandemic shows once again that they would rather score political points with their anti-abortion friends than save millions of lives” Mr. Nadler said in a Friday statement.Meanwhile pro-life advocates blasted such efforts as an attempt to take advantage of the coronavirus crisis to promote the pro-choice agenda.“There are lots of ethical alternatives and frankly they’re better and more modern science compared to the old thing of doing aborted fetal tissue” said David Prentice the vice president and research director of the pro-life Charlotte Lozier Institute who holds a doctorate in cellular biology. “It just strikes me as they’re pleading for the funds. They don’t want to let a good crisis go to waste.”Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton tweeted: “The ‘researcher’ behind the purchase of organs of aborted beings pushes #coronavirus as an excuse for taxpayer funding.”He referred to Kim Hasenkrug an immunologist at the National Institutes of Health’s Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton Montana who has sought an exemption to conduct experiments for COVID-19 treatments on “humanized mice” implanted with human fetal lung tissue from elective abortions according to a March 18 report in The Washington Post.Rep. Jan Schakowsky Illinois Democrat reacted by accusing the White House of “once again prioritizing ideology over science.” NARAL Pro-Choice America said the administration “cares more about promoting anti-choice policies than enabling scientists to conduct crucial research during a time of crisis.”The Montana lab referred inquiries to Health and Human Services spokeswoman Caitlin Oakley who said Tuesday that “no decision has been made” on the request for an exemption from the June 5 policy.The department also cited Mr. Trump’s aggressive response to the coronavirus outbreak including “kick-starting the development of vaccines and therapeutics through every possible avenue.”“The Trump Administration has activated a whole-of-government whole-of-America approach to prepare for and respond to COVID-19” said the HHS statement. “President Trump’s bold decisive actions at the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak bought the United States extremely valuable time to prepare.”The Lozier Institute the research arm of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List disputed the contention that “aborted baby parts” are needed to develop a vaccine. It said more than 60 potential treatments are under investigation “none of which need aborted fetal tissue to fight coronavirus.”“Those who advocate experimentation using body parts harvested from aborted children are shamelessly exploiting the coronavirus pandemic playing on people’s fears at a vulnerable time so that a select few can continue to use aborted fetal tissue in their research” said the institute. “The fact is that there are modern successful alternatives available.”Judicial Watch released internal documents last month that showed the NIH paid $18100 to Advanced Bioscience Resources from December 2016 to August 2018 for livers and thymuses from second-trimester abortions including 26 purchases from Mr. Hasenkrug for HIV research.Mr. Hasenkrug serves as an affiliate associate professor at Montana State University and the University of Montana. In 2016 he was elected a fellow of the American Academy of Microbiology according to his biography.Pro-choice advocates were outraged last year when the HHS discontinued research at intramural facilities — those within the NIH system — that required “new acquisition of fetal tissue from elective abortions.”“Promoting the dignity of human life from conception to natural death is one of the very top priorities of President Trump’s administration” the HHS said in its June 5 statement.

Ted Cruz Texas Republican accused Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak of “partisan politics” for restricting the use of hydroxychloroquine after President Trump touted it as a treatment for COVID-19.“Neither of us is a doctor & neither knows what treatment is most effective against this disease” said Mr. Cruz in a late Wednesday tweet. “Your order prohibits NV doctors—outside of a hospital—from prescribing what they in their medical judgment think can help their patients. That’s partisan politics; this is a crisis.”Mr. Sisolak a Democrat signed an emergency order Tuesday limiting doctors from prescribing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine which are commonly used to treat malaria for the novel coronavirus to patients in a hospital setting.His order came after an Arizona man died and his wife was hospitalized after ingesting the aquarium cleaner chloroquine phosphate in an effort to protect against COVID-19.In response Mr. Sisolak noted that Texas recently adopted limits on hydroxychloroquine amid reports that prescribers have been hoarding the drug which has been used off-label in combination with the antibiotic azythromycin to treat the virus.The governor cited the risk of “bad actors … creating a shortage of critical drugs for those that need it the most.”“We’re in a pandemic. As leaders let’s stand together as Americans to forget the partisan politics put the health & safety of our citizens first & commit to sharing accurate information” tweeted Mr. Sisolak. “We can mitigate and stop #COVID19 if we do it together.”The Texas State Board of Pharmacy order adopted March 20 limits prescriptions of four drugs including chloroquine hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to 14 days but does not restrict their use to inpatients only.Ted Cruz✔@tedcruzNeither of us is a doctor & neither knows what treatment is most effective against this disease.

Let’s let these $2 trillion go to work for us plus the $8 billion ahead of time and the billions of dollars that we just passed on the second bill.”The House is expected to take up the $2.2 trillion rescue package on Friday morning.Before the “phase three” legislation Congress had also cleared an $8.3 billion bill to boost federal health funding and a $105 billion bill to try to expand free COVID-19 testing and bolster some safety net programs.The new $2.2 trillion package provides for one-time direct payments of $1200 for many Americans plus about $367 billion to help small businesses make payroll $500 billion in loans for distressed corporations and more money for hospitals states and localities.White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said this week that factoring in some $4 trillion of lending authority for the Federal Reserve the total stimulus could add up to about $6 trillion or 30% of GDP.

The Washington Times takes a weekly look at how the candidates’ proposals stack up against each other.All eyes were on the $2.2 trillion financial rescue package making its way through Congress this week.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden and Sen. Bernard Sanders of Vermont both said that proper oversight will be needed and that more needs to be done but they offered different policy prescriptions for how to move the country forward amid the unprecedented coronavirus crisis.Joseph R. BidenMr. Biden who had hoped for quick passage of the $2.2 trillion economic rescue package on Thursday laid out a series of emergency steps he would take to try to make sure the money is going where it’s supposed to be going.Mr. Biden called the congressional package a “very important step” but said there is more he would do if elected president.“It would be catastrophic to reopen everything without a plan and then have a spike in cases and shut it back down” he said.Mr. Biden has been talking to media and cutting videos from his Wilmington Delaware home as the coronavirus has ground traditional political campaigning to a halt.He said he would establish a task force that reports directly to him to track all the spending and touted his oversight of the implementation of the post-2008 economic recovery act.Mr. Biden also said he would call in major banks and tell them to get the small business loans in the stimulus package out the door.“If they don’t make small business a priority I would seek authority … to make sure they had to do that” he said.For larger corporations seeking taxpayer money Mr. Biden’s campaign said he would hold the line on banning stock buybacks and pay raises for executives.He also said he wants to build on the current deal with proposals such as forgiving at least $10000 of federal student loans per person increasing Social Security checks by $200 per month and providing emergency paid sick leave for everyone who needs it including those in the gig economy and the self-employed.“This was a very good start but more has to be done” he said. “Congress is doing its job. The president has to do his now. This is all about implementation priorities detail accountability. Do it now.”Bernard SandersMr. Sanders on Thursday said he reluctantly voted for the package because people across the country are hurting but that he remains deeply concerned about its implementation as well as a special fund for corporations that he predicted President Trump would try to exploit.“I think you have a president who is fundamentally dishonest who is corrupt and we have now given him $500 billion to play with with not enough oversight” Mr. Sanders said on WAMU radio’s “1A” program. “That is the most dangerous part of this whole bill.”Democrats have derided the $500 billion in loans for distressed corporations as a “slush fund” though they touted that they managed to secure additional oversight in the negotiations. Republicans say they never objected to the structure of the oversight and that Democrats were seeking to claim additional powers tied to the administration’s coronavirus response.Mr. Sanders also said some of his “anti-worker” Republican colleagues wanted to prevent some workers from receiving the additional $600 per week in unemployment benefits provided for in the bill on top of their current benefits which are generally set by the states.Several Republican senators had raised last-minute objections saying that the provision might make it more lucrative for many Americans to go on unemployment rather than try to hold onto their current jobs.Mr. Sanders on Wednesday had threatened to block speedy passage of the bill to secure additional oversight over the $500 billion fund if the GOP senators didn’t drop their objections.He mocked the Republican viewpoint in a floor speech Wednesday.“Oh my God — the universe is collapsing. Imagine that” he said. “Somebody [who’s] making 12 bucks an hour now like the rest of us faces an unprecedented economic crisis…might be making a few bucks more for four months. Oh my word! Will the universe survive?”Mr. Sanders also called for $2000 checks to go out to Americans each month for the duration of the crisis. The bill calls for one-time checks of at least $1200 to go out to millions of Americans.He said there will likely be another major piece of legislation in the coming weeks or months.“I have very little doubt that while this is a start we’re going to have to come back and address the needs of working people in a far more substantial way” he said Thursday.
261,How one House Republican’s stunt could have delayed the passage of the coronavirus stimulus,Ella Nilsen and Li Zhou,Vox,-2,https://www.vox.com/2020/3/27/21196935/thomas-massie-coronavirus-stimulus-quorum-recorded-vote,Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill and the White House can agree on one thing: how annoyed they are with Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY).That’s because the conservative Congress member from Kentucky nearly delayed the House’s passage of the massive $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package meant to help Americans who’ve lost their jobs and industries that’ve been hit hard by the pandemic. And on top of that he forced a number of lawmakers to fly back to the Capitol amid the current public health crisis.Massie hinted to local radio station 55 KRC radio Thursday morning that he might object to a voice vote in the House — and confirmed that he would do so via a Twitter thread on Friday. The voice vote had been planned as a way to pass the bipartisan bill without having to call too many members back to DC endangering them with travel during a global pandemic.Thomas Massie✔@RepThomasMassie(1/11)I swore an oath to uphold the constitution and I take that oath seriously. In a few moments I will request a vote on the CARES Act which means members of Congress will vote on it by pushing “yes” or “no” or “present.”868311:48 AM - Mar 27 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy6941 people are talking about this“I’m having a really hard time with this. Because they’re saying well it’s hard to travel yadda yadda yadda” Massie told the radio station. “Well last night 96 out of 100 senators voted. All we would need is 218 out of 435 to vote.”The threat of Massie calling for a recorded vote and quorum abruptly changed the House’s plans. On Thursday Democratic and Republican leadership alike suddenly called members back to Washington DC. Several lawmakers took photos and videos of themselves preparing to drive back to DC or flying with other members on nearly empty airplanes. Some members from California and other western states caught red-eyes.Rep. Dusty Johnson✔@RepDustyJohnsonA bipartisan (and socially distanced) flight to DC this morning to vote on Coronavirus economic relief. @RepPeteStauber @RepAngieCraig @BettyMcCollum04View image on Twitter8928:05 AM - Mar 27 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy238 people are talking about thisMassie got plenty of blame from colleagues on both sides of the aisle who accused him of needlessly endangering the health of his fellow lawmakers when the outcome of the bill’s passage would ultimately be the same. Lawmakers ultimately passed the bill by voice vote any way but a quorum or 216 members needed to be present to move forward due to his concerns. (Congress already has several confirmed cases of Covid-19 the illness caused by coronavirus.)Without referring to Massie by name New York Republican Rep. Peter King called the actions of “one Member of Congress” “disgraceful” and “irresponsible.”President Donald Trump also torched Massie on Twitter for threatening to hold up the bill calling him a “third rate Grandstander” and a “disaster for America.”Donald J. Trump✔@realDonaldTrump · 7hLooks like a third rate Grandstander named @RepThomasMassie a Congressman from unfortunately a truly GREAT State Kentucky wants to vote against the new Save Our Workers Bill in Congress. He just wants the publicity. He can’t stop it only delay which is both dangerous......Donald J. Trump✔@realDonaldTrump...& costly. Workers & small businesses need money now in order to survive. Virus wasn’t their fault. It is “HELL” dealing with the Dems had to give up some stupid things in order to get the “big picture” done. 90% GREAT! WIN BACK HOUSE but throw Massie out of Republican Party!48.8K9:44 AM - Mar 27 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy19.5K people are talking about thisMassie is a conservative and libertarian-leaning lawmaker who objects to big government spending. This is certainly not the first time he has tried to block legislation; in May 2019 Massie objected to a $19 billion emergency relief bill for states hit by hurricanes floods and wildfires going through on a voice vote — calling for a full vote of the House and delaying that bill’s passage.The coronavirus bill is much larger and an arguably more urgent situation.Massie is capitalizing on House procedureA big question that emerged as Congress considered this $2 trillion stimulus was how exactly lawmakers would be able to vote on it since most House members had returned to their home districts.Congress doesn’t allow remote voting (despite a push from California Reps. Katie Porter and Eric Swalwell to make an exception). So earlier this week House leaders had announced that they would be taking a “voice vote” which works a lot like it sounds: If more people vocalize their support for the bill on the House floor than those who do not the legislation passes. (In effect the louder group has it.) In the case of a voice vote you don’t need a full quorum and people’s individual votes are not recorded.If the House were able to go this route a couple members who were still in Washington could have quickly passed the bill while most lawmakers remained in their districts.Any House member however can demand that a quorum or majority be present for a vote — and Massie did just that. Given his request a majority of members or 216 lawmakers needed to be physically present in the House to move forward with the vote. Massie also tried to force a recorded vote in which every lawmaker’s position is documented.Massie argued that he wanted the quorum because it’s lawmakers’ constitutional duty to be physically present for these acts. There had previously been speculation about whether other lawmakers including progressive Democrats would push for a recorded roll call vote due to concerns about the legislation’s bailout money for corporations — but that didn’t wind up happening.In trying to prove a point Massie’s efforts discounted the unprecedented hazards posed by the coronavirus outbreak and the risks that members took by returning to the Capitol.
262,How do 3 million newly unemployed people get health care?,Dylan Scott,Vox,-2,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/27/21197279/coronavirus-us-unemployment-health-insurance,More than 3 million Americans just lost their jobs in the middle of a global pandemic. For those whose jobs offered benefits that also probably means they’re losing their health insurance too — exposing yet another way in which the US health system is vulnerable amid a public health emergency.And what are all of those people supposed to do now during the Covid-19 coronavirus outbreak when having health coverage is as vital or more so than ever?”With the number of people losing their jobs there’s little doubt that the number of people uninsured is increasing right now” Larry Levitt senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation told me “at the exact time when some of them will need health care the most if they become infected and seriously ill.”We don’t know exactly how much the uninsured rate is increasing — and it might not be by a full 3 million people but not necessarily for fortunate reasons. A lot of these newly unemployed people probably didn’t have health insurance or they already rely on public programs like Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act.The workers most vulnerable to losing their jobs from Covid-19 were more likely to work in the service or retail industries and they were more likely to be low-wage workers.Survey data from the Kaiser Family Foundation indicates cooks waiters and waitresses sales workers and cashiers are some of the jobs with the highest uninsured rates in the US. The food service industry has the most workers on Medicaid according to KFF with about 1.4 million already covered by the government program.These jobs don’t pay particularly well and the businesses that employ these workers are less likely to offer health insurance at all. About one-third of retail firms provide health benefits and the service industry also ranks behind most others in providing health coverage.So because of our fractured system which depends on employers to cover health benefits for a lot of workers the people who lost their jobs as the coronavirus economic panic set in were already at more of a disadvantage when it comes to getting covered.And now those who were lucky enough to get insurance through work have lost their benefits. What are they supposed to do?There is COBRA though it is increasingly obsolete since the ACA became law. COBRA allows people to continue buying into their existing health plan even after they have been laid off. They could be required to pay the full premium with no help from their old employer which is exorbitantly expensive: $7200 for an individual and more than $20000 for a family on average.People who lost their job are also eligible for a special enrollment period on the ACA’s private insurance markets and lower-wage workers may qualify for federal subsidies to buy a new plan. States are also moving open enrollment up to more people though the initial deadline to sign up for 2020 coverage has passed.Some unemployed people will be eligible for Medicaid which determines income on a monthly basis “so many people completely out of work will qualify” Levitt said.But they may not be eligible if they live in one of the 14 states that have refused to expand Medicaid under the ACA leaving more than 2 million people in poverty without health insurance.However even if people remain uninsured the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has told me in a statement that the agency believes it has the legal authority to cover Covid-19 testing and treatment for them. From a statement sent via email:CDC does have the authority to pay for COVID-19 testing and treatment of Americans without health insurance through various statutory authorities. Payment for testing services will be provided through a variety of mechanisms in collaboration with state local and federal as well as private partners as part of a government-wide effort to ensure that those requiring access to testing receive it.So in theory nobody should be denied treatment or testing because they can’t afford to pay. The Trump administration is on the record saying as much.But stories are already surfacing of Americans who were turned away or got hit with a massive bill because they didn’t have insurance. The total cost of treatment particularly for complex cases could add up to tens of thousands of dollars.And even for people who do have insurance they could be forced to spend hundreds if not thousands of dollars if they get hospitalized because of Covid-19.Those high costs are a real obstacle in a medical crisis. We know from research that people skip needed health care because of costs all the time including for serious and potentially deadly conditions. The last thing we want during a pandemic driven by a stealthy virus that people can pass unwittingly to others is for patients to avoid care because they’re worried about incurring a big bill for mild symptoms.”The big concern is that people might wait until they get very very sick before going to the hospital and the possibility that they could have exposed more people along the way increases” says Cynthia Cox who directs the Peterson-Kaiser Health System Tracker.But as the coronavirus’s economic toll starts to sink in the challenge of getting people covered and getting them cared for is also going to deepen.
263,How the coronavirus outbreak is roiling the film and entertainment industries,Alissa Wilkinson,Vox,-2,https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/3/10/21173376/coronavirus-cancel-delay-wonder-woman-olympics-cannes-disney,"The Covid-19 coronavirus pandemic which was first identified in China in December has had sweeping effects in the public health business and travel sectors among others. And while the repercussions for the entertainment industry may seem to pale in comparison to the clear threat the virus poses to human life the ripple effects do have implications for the people around the world who make a living producing and distributing movies music and more.The immense and lucrative Chinese film industry was hit almost immediately as movie theaters across the country were closed and major releases were delayed. Hollywood soon began to feel the effects too and as time passes the impact of the coronavirus on the global film and entertainment industries will certainly grow.Consequences of the pandemic on these industries could range from lowered attendance at film festivals and disruptions in film distribution to delayed or canceled movie releases and concert dates to curtailed on-location film shoots. Financial ramifications will likely be felt by studios filmmakers theater owners and more for months or even years.Here are the biggest and most significant developments in the entertainment industry in response to the pandemic. Most recently the release of Wonder Woman 1984 was delayed from June to August the Tokyo Olympics were delayed until 2021 the Cannes Film Festival was delayed and Chinese movie theaters began to reopen but quickly re-closed.Major entertainment festival cancellations and postponementsK-pop concerts canceled including BTS shows: On February 28 the hugely popular K-pop group BTS canceled a series of planned concerts in Seoul. The shows were scheduled for April 11 and 12 and April 18 and 19 at Seoul’s Olympic Stadium. The group’s management agency said the decision was made due to the impossibility of predicting the scale of the outbreak in South Korea come April and cited the health and safety of the musicians themselves workers and concertgoers. Two hundred thousand fans were expected to attend.Days earlier BTS had asked fans to avoid a series of TV appearances scheduled to promote their newest album Map Of The Soul: 7 which had originally been planned to include studio audiences. The group also appealed to fans via a streamed press conference. “Health is always on our minds these days and our messages of facing your inner self and loving yourself are ultimately only possible when you’re healthy especially since it is very risky outside these days” one of the singers Jimin said. ”I hope you take care of yourself.”The entire Korean entertainment sector has been affected by the outbreak and K-pop has been hit particularly hard with groups including GOT7 Winner Sechs Kies (G) I-DLE and others canceling scheduled tour dates. Variety reported that box office revenue in South Korea was down 30 to 40 percent in January 2020 compared to previous years.SXSW canceled: On March 6 the city of Austin Texas declared a state of disaster requiring the cancellation of public gatherings and events for the near future. The most notable of those is the cancellation of South by Southwest the annual music film TV and technology festival that serves as a significant financial powerhouse for the city.The announcement came after a week full of major companies — including Netflix Apple Amazon WarnerMedia Facebook Twitter TikTok Mashable Intel and more — dropping out of the well-attended event canceling panels premieres and other appearances. Days later SXSW organizers announced that they had laid off one-third of the festival’s employees in what they called “a necessary but heartbreaking step.”Emerald City Comic Con delayed: The organizing body behind Emerald City Comic Con the largest convention of its kind in Seattle Washington announced on March 6 that it will postpone the event until sometime this summer. The event was scheduled to run from March 12 to 16.“We did everything that we could to run the event as planned but ultimately we are following the guidance of the local public health officials indicating that conventions should now be postponed” convention organizers Reedpop said in a statement published on the Emerald City Comic Con website.Cannes Film Festival delayed: The 2020 edition of the Cannes Film Festival arguably the most prestigious film festival in the world is still in question following an announcement from the festival’s organizers on March 19 that the gathering could be delayed until “late June or early July” or another time. (The festival had been slated to take place May 12 to 23 and draws thousands of industries and press from around the globe each year.) The festival first issued a statement on February 28 after the first case of coronavirus in nearby Nice France was confirmed by the city’s mayor saying that organizers were monitoring the situation but planned for the festival to go forward. (Cannes is a seaside resort town located on the French Riviera about 30 km from Nice.)Coachella delayed: Goldenvoice the organizers of Coachella one of the largest annual music festivals in the US announced on March 10 that the festival would be postponed due to concerns about Covid-19. Another Goldenvoice festival the country music-oriented Stagecoach has also been postponed.The Indio California-based event was originally set to run for two weekends April 10-12 and April 17-19 with the same talent lineups performing both weekends. It will now run from October 9-11 and October 16-18. Stagecoach 2020 has been pushed back from April to October 23-25.Electronics Entertainment Expo (E3) canceled: The 2020 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) — the single biggest trade show in the video game industry — has been canceled. The Entertainment Software Association which organizes the event announced that it would not go forward with the annual event due to coronavirus fears in California where E3 takes place. The event was scheduled for June 9 to 11.The organization said it will contact exhibitors and attendees about receiving full refunds for passes and that it is considering ways to “coordinate an online experience” in lieu of the in-person event. It also maintains that E3 will return next year as planned.The NBA suspended basketball games indefinitely: A player on the Utah Jazz tested positive for coronavirus on March 11 leading NBA officials to call off that night’s Jazz game just before tip-off. As a further precautionary measure the league issued a statement that it would suspend the basketball season “until further notice.”Prior to putting an early pause on the rest of the season the NBA made other efforts to protect players and fans. The league barred media from locker rooms and publicly considered having teams play to empty arenas before ultimately stopping play altogether.2020 Tokyo Olympics delayed: On March 24 following pressure from athletes and multiple nations’ Olympic committees the International Olympic Committee and Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe announced that the 2020 Summer Olympics would be postponed possibly until 2021.Major film release dates postponed or canceledWonder Woman 1984 and In the Heights releases delayed: On March 24 Warner Bros. announced that it would delay the release of Wonder Woman 1984 from June 5 to August 14.

I’m gonna wait to release the film till we CAN see it all together! So here’s to our group movie date! See you soon!”Fast and Furious 9: On March 12 Universal Pictures announced that it would delay the release date of the ninth installment in the Fast and Furious franchise by 11 months from May 22 to April 2 2021.Chinese movies scrapped theatrical release and premiere online: The biggest films of China’s year are usually scheduled to release during the Lunar New Year holiday near the end of January but mounting fears of the coronavirus and public reticence to be in crowded spaces caused distributors to voluntarily cancel or postpone several film releases. Huanxi distributor of the Chinese blockbuster Lost in Russia announced on January 22 that the film would premiere online for free. Promotional materials encouraged audiences to “stay safely at home and watch Lost in Russia with your mom.” On January 31 Enter the Fat Dragon became the second major Chinese film to premiere online as theaters are closed by order of the government.Film and TV productions halted altered or shut downEurovision canceled: On March 18 the organizers of the Eurovision Song Contest announced via Twitter that the 2020 edition of the event was canceled.

(Marvel is owned by Disney.)Jia Zhangke project delayed: At the Berlin Film Festival in February famed Chinese director Jia Zhangke (Ash Is Purest White A Touch of Sin) told Indiewire that production on his new film which was slated to begin in April was delayed indefinitely. Jia spoke with Indiewire at the Berlin Film Festival where his documentary Swimming Out Till the Sea Turns Blue premiered. But he said that before he left he’d feared his flight to Berlin would be canceled and that some of his collaborators chose not to make the trip. Regarding his next film he said:For some film companies and studios involved in pre-production a lot of costs are going down the drain and those that already started production have to be somehow cut short or suspended. Some of them are already in the process of distributing films and they’ve paid for a lot of promotion and PR costs. The economy is now taking a huge hit and I think the investment side will be hugely impacted as well.Mission: Impossible production paused: On February 26 Paramount Pictures announced that it had halted a planned three-week shoot in Venice for the seventh installment in the Mission: Impossible franchise. “Out of an abundance of caution for the safety and well-being of our cast and crew and efforts of the local Venetian government to halt public gatherings in response to the threat of coronavirus we are altering the production plan for our three-week shoot in Venice the scheduled first leg of an extensive production for Mission: Impossible 7” a Paramount spokesperson told the Hollywood Reporter. “During this hiatus we want to be mindful of the concerns of the crew and are allowing them to return home until production starts. We will continue to monitor this situation and work alongside health and government officials as it evolves.”Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune tape without a studio audience: Though Sony declined to comment sources told the Hollywood Reporter on March 9 that scheduled tapings of the shows would go forward without a live studio audience.

264,Why America ran out of protective masks — and what can be done about it,German Lopez,Vox,-2,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/27/21194402/coronavirus-masks-n95-respirators-personal-protective-equipment-ppe,Doctors and nurses are now crying out for masks and other personal protective equipment as they’re forced to wear bandanas and scarves for masks trash bags for gowns and reuse all sorts of medical equipment — heightening the risk of coronavirus infection and possibly death as we all rely on these health care workers now more than ever to stem the outbreak.But the government should have seen this coming. Many people did.“When we have done exercises in the past for pandemic preparedness supply chain issues were a well-documented challenge” Saskia Popescu an epidemiologist focused on hospital preparedness told me. “This is something we’ve known about — maybe not to this extent but this isn’t a shocker. It’s more surprising that we let it get this bad.”Alameda Health System nurses doctors and workers protest the lack of personal protective equipment available in Oakland California on March 26 2020. Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesHealth care professionals and experts say we now have a shortage of masks gowns gloves and other personal protective equipment (PPE) for doctors nurses and other medical staff. In this environment health care workers worry they might get sick — perhaps forcing them to take up a hospital bed that would otherwise go to someone else — or die. Privately some say they may not be able to show up to work at all under these conditions.The situation not only threatens health care workers’ well-being it could limit US health care capacity even as experts warn we need to scale up to confront the rise in coronavirus cases.Different levels of government are now trying to take action — with cities counties states and the federal government racing to get more PPE and send it to places and hospitals that have been hardest hit by Covid-19 the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. President Donald Trump recently activated the Defense Production Act a once-obscure law that could let the feds dictate what equipment is produced and where it goes. And the federal government has started to send out some masks and other equipment from the Strategic National Stockpile although state and local officials argue the response has still been too slow.The problem experts say is that the federal government should have prepared for this months if not years ago — but it didn’t. It’s an issue that has been magnified by Trump but really transcends presidential administrations: America along with the rest of the world has never been ready for a major disease outbreak.“Every serious look at US pandemic readiness and global pandemic readiness has identified PPE shortages as a major issue” Jeremy Konyndyk senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development told me. “This is a known issue. We’ve seen it before.”We’re seeing the consequences of that now. Due to the lack of preparedness we are still lacking testing capacity for coronavirus and experts say we’re still in the dark as to how many cases there even are in the US so the current estimate could be an undercount by many times over. The lack of testing has forced us to rely more on painful social distancing measures requiring that everyone isolate to some extent to stop the spread of the virus.And in hospitals the lack of preparedness translates to a shortage of masks gowns and other PPE among other problems. As health care facilities expect beds to overflow in the next few weeks of the pandemic the shortage threatens to undermine how many doctors and nurses will be there to treat patients. More people could die as a result.The PPE shortage is a very big problem for everyone not just doctorsAs coronavirus has spread experts have talked up “flattening the curve.” The idea is to spread out the number of coronavirus cases — through social distancing testing contact tracing and other protective measures — to avoid overwhelming the health care system. Here’s what that looks like in chart form:An infographic that shows the goals of mitigation during an outbreak with two curves. The X-axis represents the number of daily cases and they Y-axis represents the amount of time since the first case. The first curve represents the number of cases when no protective measures during an outbreak are implemented and displays a large peak. The second curve is much lower representing a much smaller rise in the number of cases if protective measures are implemented.Christina Animashaun/VoxThe PPE shortage could make it harder to flatten the curve of new cases if doctors and nurses get sick. But the line representing health care system capacity also isn’t a constant. If we develop more capacity it can handle more cases at once. If capacity falls — if doctors and nurses get sick because of a lack of protective equipment or refuse to work without conditions that can ensure their safety — even a flatter curve will be hard for the system to handle.“If you have health care workers who don’t feel safe you may very well have people who don’t come to work” Val Griffeth an emergency and critical care doctor who’s helped lead #GetUsPPE told me. “Worse you have people who come to work get infected and end up in the hospital taking up a bed and also not seeing patients that day that week or that month.”Despite recent government actions experts and medical professionals warn that the protective equipment shortage is far from resolved. Report after report just in the past week found doctors and nurses having to ration and reuse medical equipment — or come up with homemade alternatives. One doctor who asked to remain anonymous to avoid upsetting her employer told me as she came off a shift this week that she still had to reuse masks and respirators on a regular basis.Some hospitals are even considering do-not-resuscitate orders for dying Covid-19 patients out of fear that such intensive close-up procedures could get health care workers without PPE infected with the coronavirus.“Even with the infusion of supplies from the strategic stockpile and other federal resources there will not be enough medical supplies including ventilators to respond to the projected COVID-19 outbreak” a March 21 letter from the American Medical Association American Hospital Association and American Nurses Association stated. “We have heard of health care providers reusing masks or resorting to makeshift alternatives for masks.”The problem is about both supply and demand. Prior to the coronavirus outbreak China made half the world’s face masks. When the outbreak took off there China started to use its supply and hoard what remained. This problem has only spread since as more and more countries hoard whatever medical supplies they can get — with some like Germany even banning most PPE exports. So as demand increased due to Covid-19 — not just from health care workers but from a general public increasingly scared of infection — there was less supply to go around.Some public health officials and experts tried to tamp down on public demand by suggesting face masks wouldn’t help laypeople avoid infection. But experts told me this messaging backfired: There is evidence that masks help people avoid infection and once the public saw doctors and nurses were using and wanted more of the masks that likely fueled distrust toward what public officials and experts were saying — and people bought up masks anyway.The result now is a shortage that not only threatens doctors nurses and other medical professionals at the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic but also puts us all at serious risk since we’re relying on these same health care workers to literally save us if we get sick.The risk is big: If those health care workers get sick and are unable to care for people more patients are likely going to suffer and die — and not just from Covid-19 but just about any other medical issue from heart attacks to car crashes that we’ll need health care workers for in the next few months.The government should have prepared for this. It didn’t.In the years before the coronavirus pandemic government officials and epidemiologists regularly ran simulations and exercises to see what would happen in case of a big outbreak. One of those simulations held by the federal government as the New York Times reported covered a pandemic that looked a lot like the one we’re facing now: a respiratory virus that started in China and made its way to the US and the rest of the world.Among the many problems the Times found were “deficiencies ‘in personal protective equipment use.’” The exercise found that the US didn’t have the means to quickly produce more PPE. When states turned to the federal government for help in the exercise there was “confusion” and “bureaucratic chaos” as requests and submissions hit multiple agencies at once.The Trump administration ignored and eventually disbanded a White House office dedicated solely to pandemic preparedness that was established by President Obama. Evan Vucci-Pool/Getty ImagesThis was far from the only simulation to produce these results experts told me. Konyndyk in fact pointed to a real-world example that highlighted the failures: the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak. While working in President Barack Obama’s administration at the time Konyndyk quickly realized that America — and much of the world — was simply not ready for a major disease outbreak.“I came away from that experience just completely horrified at how unready we would be for something more dangerous than Ebola” he said noting Ebola was thankfully relatively hard to transmit.Indeed experts and advocates argue that the US generally underfunds disease outbreak preparedness and public health programs more broadly. It’s these concerns that led the Obama administration after the Ebola outbreak to attempt to scale up preparedness by establishing a White House office dedicated solely to the issue and producing a 69-page playbook in case of an outbreak. The Trump administration however neglected and rolled back these efforts eventually disbanding the White House office.We’ve seen the results in the botched rollout of coronavirus testing but PPE offers another example. America could have shored up its supplies of PPE in its strategic stockpile. It could have ensured that there would be surge capacity to boost production in case of emergency. And it should have been doing this all before the coronavirus pandemic.But it didn’t. As of earlier this month the US had 12 million N95 respirators and 30 million surgical masks in its Strategic National Stockpile — which officials acknowledged was just 1 percent of what the country needed in a full-blown pandemic.“The US … was not prepared” Jen Kates a senior vice president and director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation told me. “A good preparedness plan would have helped address this and had things in place to allow for that increased need to be met.”The Trump administration could have started to do more in January when it became clear that Covid-19 could pose a threat to the entire world. But Konyndyk said the administration just didn’t do that: “What that prompted on our side was travel bans but no serious action to reinforce domestic readiness.”So now doctors and nurses are forced to resort to bandanas trash bags and homemade equipment instead of actual protective gear.There’s still some time to actAt this point experts warn that the US is stuck playing catch-up. But there are some things different levels of government can do and are doing to make the situation on the ground a bit better.For one PPE production needs to be increased. Already private companies are starting to do this — with even car manufacturers like Ford vowing to 3D print face shields and masks for health care workers. In the several bills Congress has passed and is working on to tackle the coronavirus pandemic federal lawmakers have also committed more funds to boosting production of PPE.Workers in an industrial sewing room sit at sewing machines.Employees at AST Sportswear in Brea California switched from making T-shirts to making masks to meet the coronavirus demand. Mindy Schauer/MediaNews Group/Orange County Register via Getty Images Andrew Martinez director of operations lines up fabric cutouts that will become masks at Xtreme Pro Apparel in Broomfield Colorado on March 23 2020. Helen H. Richardson/Denver Post via Getty ImagesBut scaling up production will take time — maybe weeks or months — during which the coronavirus will continue to spread. That’s why the PPE that’s already out there needs to be reprioritized for doctors nurses and other health care workers.The federal government says it’s now taking some action. In a statement a spokesperson for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) which is overseeing the response to the outbreak said that federal agencies are “working to meet demands for personal protective equipment (PPE) through new acquisition [Department of Defense] allocation or Strategic National Stockpile sources.”But experts say the federal government isn’t doing enough with multiple people describing the current response as “a systemic failure.” Local and state officials complain that they now have to outbid each other as well as other countries and the federal government to secure dwindling supplies even if they need PPE more than other bidders.Much of the criticism has focused on Trump’s use of the Defense Production Act. The law probably can’t enable much more PPE production in the short term since new production can take weeks or months to scale. But it does let the federal government reprioritize the production that’s already out there.For example the feds can tell factories making surgical masks to direct their products to New York — which is currently suffering the worst coronavirus outbreak in the US — over states that aren’t as hard hit. Or the federal government can buy up the supply and then direct it on its own accord. Or it can even order some factories that don’t normally make PPE to start producing it while providing funds for these operations to get up and running (although again that can take time).The idea: During normal times companies are typically guided by profits and a “first come first serve” basis. But during an emergency that’s not good enough; some places will need certain products first even if they don’t have more money or didn’t place the order first.Trump signed an executive order invoking the Defense Production Act last week. But he’s wavered on fully activating the law and forcing manufacturers to scale up production in a specific mandated way instead arguing that he’s merely using the Defense Production Act as “leverage” to get companies to do the right thing. He’s compared fully activating the law to “socialism” — which experts say is false because the Defense Production Act doesn’t let the government nationalize a private company or asset.The administration did say it was going to use the Defense Production Act more fully earlier this week but it then abruptly backed down.This has led some public officials and advocates to criticize the administration for not going far enough. “I do not for the life of me understand the reluctance to use the federal Defense Production Act” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a March 24 press conference.Experts disagree on just how far the federal government should go here. James Hasik a senior fellow at George Mason University’s Center for Government Contracting said that the law should be used “more as a scalpel than an ax.” Rather than placing a mass order of products he added “You want to find where the particular problems are. You want to let industry mostly solve these problems. And when somebody is being a jerk and needs to be told ‘No you’re not cooperating you’re not playing well during this national emergency’ then you send a letter or make a phone call.”Others take a more aggressive view. Steve Grundman a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council told me that “this is a whole different kind of crisis.” In his view the current outbreak requires the federal government to get more hands-on than it has in the past compared to when he oversaw Defense Production Act implementation in the 1990s as a deputy undersecretary in the Defense Department.That could require more aggressive broader orders about what should be produced and where it should go. At the very least it should require much more coordination than the Trump administration appears to be providing so far — a point that Hasik agreed with.That such aggressive action may even be needed though further exposes the underlying problem: America was not ready for the coronavirus pandemic. And the ongoing response to the current outbreak isn’t leading to more confidence that it’ll be ready for the next one either.“People want to be able to feel safe” Griffeth said. “Because the government has been so slow in responding to this pandemic people don’t feel safe.”
265,How New York became the epicenter of America’s coronavirus crisis,Jen Kirby and Emily Stewart,Vox,-2,https://www.vox.com/coronavirus-covid19/2020/3/27/21195162/new-york-coronavirus-news-andrew-cuomo-hospitals-population-ventilators,New York City is the epicenter of the coronavirus crisis in the United States in part because of the nature of the city itself — an international hub tightly packed with people from all over the country and the world. And now what makes New York unique has also rendered it vulnerable to a global pandemic.The city has recorded more than 25000 cases of coronavirus across its five boroughs as of March 27. This accounts for a large share of all confirmed cases — more than 90000 — in the entire United States.This is just the beginning. Though the state including the city has been under strict stay-at-home orders since Sunday New York is not expected to reach its peak in coronavirus cases for at least another three weeks. On March 25 New York Mayor Bill de Blasio predicted that in a city of 8 million half the population should expect to to get coronavirus before the pandemic ends.There is still many unknowns about the coronavirus but based on current data the current hospitalization rate is about 19 percent worldwide with a fatality rate between 1 and 3.4 percent. Those numbers are evolving as more data becomes available.What this means in reality is difficult to fathom. More than 4500 people have been hospitalized in New York City since the start of the outbreak here. Hospitals and healthcare workers are already struggling to meet the surge of coronavirus patients in the city. “Mostly everything that’s coming in now is all a flavor of coronavirus” Stefan Flores a professor emergency medicine at Columbia University said of his emergency room in the city.A doctor in Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens — the borough that is the epicenter of the epicenter with more than 8000 confirmed cases — told BuzzFeed News that he estimates 60 people in the 545-bed facility have been intubated which allows them to be hooked up to a respirator. “Elmhurst is just getting destroyed. It’s very very gruesome” the doctor said. Outside the facility lines of people stretch out many in masks as they wait to be tested.Doctors test hospital staff with flu-like symptoms for coronavirus at St. Barnabas hospital in the Bronx. Misha Friedman/Getty ImagesState and local officials are taking urgent efforts to expand hospital capacity: adding more hospital beds pleading for more ventilators. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a press conference on March 25 the entire state could need as many as 140000 hospital beds. It has 53000 right now.Officials are frantically trying to find spaces to care for the New Yorkers they expect to become sick. Army Corps of Engineers are planning to build field hospitals at now-empty colleges on Long Island and to remake the Jacob Javits Center the convention center on the far west side of Manhattan into a FEMA hospital. Mayor de Blasio said Thursday the city is trying to triple its capacity — to 60000 beds — by May. That still may not be enough.As the number of cases rise so too will the death toll. Right now more than 365 have died in New York City from the coronavirus. On Wednesday the city saw the largest in one 24 hour period so far when 88 people died from coronavirus in a single day. Refrigerated trucks are being parked outside of hospitals in case city morgues and hospitals are overwhelmed.The city’s statistics are staggering but New York City may also have a sharper grasp of the scale of the unfolding crisis. New York state has lead the nation in testing with more than 138000 people tested including nearly 58000 in New York City alone. The total number of tests given in all 50 states is more than 519000.It is a warning and a lesson for the rest of the United States.Is New York City unique — or just first?New York’s first coronavirus case was detected on Sunday March 1 in Manhattan. Officials identified her as a woman in her 30s who had recently traveled to Iran. At that point New York had tested all of 32 people for the coronavirus all negative except for this one.“There is no cause for surprise — this was expected” Cuomo said in a statement at the time. “I said from the beginning it was a matter of when not if there would be a positive case of novel coronavirus in New York.”A few days later on March 3 the state said a second person had tested positive a lawyer who lived in Westchester and worked in Midtown Manhattan. He hadn’t traveled or been exposed to anyone with the virus which meant he was also the first instance of community spread in the state. Officials rushed to track his movements but they were also direct: “This is a crisis that it’s fair to say will likely be with us for several months” Mayor Bill de Blasio said at the time.Since then the count of confirmed coronavirus cases in New York has surged. Museums Broadway and once-crowded bars and restaurants have shuttered. On March 15 the city shut down all city public schools until at least April 20.On Sunday March 22 Cuomo ordered nonessential businesses closed and people to stay at home something the mayor had earlier proposed doing. The New York City subway and bus lines continue to operate so they’re available to transport those essential workers. The city even now taking down basketball hoops to stop people from playing together. And yet the number of cases in New York continue to grow unabated.“Why does New York have such a high number?” Governor Cuomo said of coronavirus cases at a press conference on Wednesday a recognition of the crisis that’s happening in the state.He followed up by saying in his personal opinion there were two answers. The first was “because we welcome people from across the globe.” Cuomo said he expects the virus was in New York City much earlier than perhaps officials knew because people came to New York from just about everywhere else.“The second answer is because we are close” Cuomo said. “We talk about the virus and how it transfers in a dense area it is literally because we are close.”“Our closeness makes us vulnerable” Cuomo added.Gov.

Cindy Ord/Getty ImagesCuomo’s explanations — that New York is an international nexus and an urban area where people live and commute closely packed together — likely does have something to do with the coronavirus’s rapid spread across the five boroughs. New York has 27000 residents per square mile beating the second place San Francisco with 18000 per square mile according to the New York Times. And if you’ve ever ridden a New York City subway at rush hour imagine how a respiratory illness might fare in that environment.“New York City is often ahead of the curve when it comes to trends. It has a huge number of travelers and is densely populated — both factors that likely accelerated spread of infections here” Tom Frieden former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and former commissioner of the New York City Health Department told Vox.Public health officials still do not know with certainty when coronavirus arrived here or why it hit New York so hard and so fast. Officials do not yet have the data to get a complete picture and probably won’t for quite some time — if at all.The state of New York is testing more far people than the rest of the country right now which contributes to the high number of cases (beyond the fact that it’s a populous city) but it’s not testing everyone. And there still isn’t blood testing to determine who has antibodies and decipher how much of the population has already been infected. Many companies and individual labs are working on developing such testing and some antibody tests are being used in other countries but aren’t yet available in the US said University of Washington virologist Keith Jerome in an email. “I expect we’ll start to see these in late April or May” he said.“One of the challenges everybody has is trying to explain something absent the data that would really be helpful” Andrew Goodman a public health researcher at NYU.New York might have these distinctive factors that contributed to the rapidity and intensity of infections here but it also lacked the testing capabilities to actually detect the coronavirus early on. This isn’t specific to New York; this is a problem the entire country has faced. Dr. Anthony Fauci the federal government’s top infectious disease scientist called this a “failing” at a congressional hearing earlier in March.“The idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countries are doing it — we’re not set up for that. Do I think we should be? Yes. But we’re not” Fauci said.Since the United States as a whole struggled to get adequate testing ramped up New York wasn’t exempt. “We were seeing what was unfolding overseas” said Syra Madad a special pathogens expert at the NYC Health and Hospitals network. “So why would we not think that we would not see cases here in the United States? And so we were obviously ill-prepared as a nation. Not as a state but as a nation in ramping up our diagnostic capabilities.”New York City officials were pleading with the federal government for more coronavirus tests and for greater criteria for testing even before the first cases were confirmed in New York.“We believe that if [the CDC] would empower local laboratories we could work with them to do high-quality testing faster that would allow us to stay ahead of the situation” de Blasio said on February 26 adding “We also call upon the CDC to add to its testing regimen for travelers. Right now it is too narrowly focused on travelers coming out of China. We think that has to be expanded to any traveler coming from a country that’s seen a major surge in cases.”On March 6 as New York had already realized coronavirus had arrived with 22 new cases city officials again begged the CDC for more tests saying it the lack of testing had “impeded our ability to beat back this epidemic.”As the New York Times reported the mix of of competing federal state and local regulations compounded the problem and might have intensified delays. But it show just how important testing was — and how serious the failures — in trying to slow the spread of coronavirus.“If we had been more aggressive earlier with testing identifying cases doing contact tracing to identify the people who are exposed we could have done a lot better” said Goodman a public health researcher at NYU. “But for public health often the success is the absence of something happening.”He compared it to watching a Category 5 hurricane approach. You can hope for the best and if it doesn’t hit it’s fine. But if it does make landfall it’s much better to be prepared.Health care professionals take a break awaiting patients as they test for Covid-19 at a testing site in Jericho New York. Steve Pfost/Newsday via Getty ImagesNew York implemented its statewide stay-at-home orders on March 22 following lockdowns in San Francisco and the surrounding area and California. New York City also closed schools a lot later than other states. In hindsight experts said maybe New York was slower to act than it should have in implementing aggressive social distancing measures early on.But shutting down an entire city because without knowing the scale of the crisis — specifically the scope of infection in the city — is extraordinarily difficult. It takes adept planning and coordination especially in a place like New York City which also has commuters pouring out into the suburbs including in states like New Jersey and Connecticut. It also requires buy-in of the citizens which is still not entirely happening based on crowds at some parks. Would all of New York City and all of its businesses have bought into a citywide shutdown with two cases of coronavirus? Or even 100?That Madad said is why testing — hard data — is so critical and why the failures across the US to implement it are so striking. “It has a huge economic and social toll” Maddad said of these stay-at-home orders. “You don’t want to make these decisions without having some data. And unfortunately that data didn’t exist because diagnostic capabilities was not ramped up. Everything goes hand-in-hand.”And now part of the reason New York City might look so bad is simply because we have a lot more information. “If you test a lot you’re going to find a lot” Anna Muldoon a former science policy adviser in the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) at the Department of Health and Human Services. “And New York’s Department of Health managed to get testing rolled out more effectively and efficiently than a lot of places so they may just have found more cases.”She added that here too New York City’s dense population might have helped — it might be much easier to access a testing site or outreach to a population in a place like New York City. But the bottom line seems to be: now that the city knows the scope of the problem it may be too late.What’s next for New YorkThe grim reality in New York right now is that the coronavirus situation is likely to get worse before it gets better. While state officials say that social distancing measures may be working the governor on March 25 warned that the outbreak is expected to peak in to to three weeks. And the next day he noted the focus is currently not on a reduction of cases but instead on a reduction in the rate of increase of the number of cases. “That’s what comes first when you’re starting to make progress” he said.New York put out a statewide call for retired health care professionals to sign up to be part of a reserve staff for the coronavirus response. Judy Salerno president of the New York City Academy of Medicine who also volunteered in Louisiana after Hurricane Katrina signed up and gained public attention when she responded to one of the governor’s tweets asking about when she would hear back. She and thousands of other medical professionals are now part of a reserve staff on hand.People work in the Brooklyn Navy Yard where local industrial firms have begun manufacturing Personal Protective Equipment like face shields to supply the city’s health care workers and hospitals.

They’re not going to pull them out of hospitals” she said noting that health care providers are also getting sick. “I’m ready willing and able to work as are a lot of my friends.”Salerno who is in her 60s is in a higher risk group for serious illness because of her age. “When it’s a matter of life and death I’ve probably been exposed to a number of people going to Morton Williams to pick up groceries. If we all in a crisis do our part we have to take our skills and figure out what’s the best and the highest use for our skills. And this is mine right now and so as soon as they need me I will be there” she said. “Is there concern? Yeah. Fear? No.”The city’s health care crisis will have ripple effects beyond what’s happening in hospitals and clinics.“Obviously the health care crisis is going to get worse in the next couple of weeks I think that’s already being demonstrated today” said Isaac Weisfuse former deputy commissioner at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. “I also think we’re going to face a social service crisis in that as more and more people get sick some of the social service deliveries to vulnerable populations is going to suffer and New York City is going to have to be very agile in figuring out how to deal with that.”A truck with a message in Spanish reading “Washing your hands kills bacteria” drives past the Javits Center in New York City. Bryan R. Smith/AFP via Getty ImagesThat translates for example to care for the elderly and people who depend on visiting nurses and home health aides to meet some of their basic needs. “If those nurses get sick and the elderly can’t be visited or their home health aides can’t go to them they’re going to have physical and mental problems that are just going to exacerbate the health care crisis” Weisfuse said. The issue extends to services such as meals on wheels food banks protective services mental health and disability support.At a press briefing on March 26 Cuomo described the crisis in New York as a “life moment.” But he said the state will persist. “We’re going to get through this” he said “the only question is how we get through it and when we get through it.”And like across the rest of the country there are economic ramifications as well. All non-essential businesses across the states have been shut down putting thousands of New Yorkers out of work and shuttering businesses big and small across the state. It’s a “double-whammy” Cuomo said on Thursday because the state has increased expenses to combat coronavirus and is also losing revenue because businesses are closed. “We’re spending more to take care of the Covid virus and we’re receiving less” he said estimating the state will lose $10 to $15 billion in revenue. “That’s a ton of money for the state of New York’s budget.”Cuomo also has an antagonistic relationship with President Donald Trump which could be detrimental to the state’s ability to respond. For example the president has cast doubt on the state’s need for ventilators and suggested New York doesn’t need as many as state officials say.Other cities and states may not be far behind New YorkThere’s almost a predictable cycle around coronavirus as it spreads across the globe: it’s somewhere else you assume because of some shortcoming there and it won’t be that bad where you are. But then it gets to where you are and you think your city state or country will do better. But will it?As long as New York City has existed it has dealt with outbreaks and epidemics. From cholera in the 19th century to the Spanish flu in the 20th century to even the brief Ebola scare in the 2010s the city has ended up on the frontlines of global health crises. And because there are qualities that are unique to New York — it’s an international hub and a populous and dense place — it has often been stereotyped by outsiders as a dirty city full of foreigners including by much of America.“It actually took a lot of work to get people to think of New York as a place that connected to the rest of the country” Muldoon said explaining that New York’s history with infectious diseases as a lot to do with that. “It’s not just New York ego that has set that up. That is a long standing.”That sense is not entirely absent from the coronavirus outbreak either. The White House has ordered anyone who passed through New York City to self-quarantine for 14 days and other states have made similar orders. The president’s home state is floundering as he insists the country will be back to normal by Easter.But if New York is first and was unprepared other states should try not to repeat those mistakes. If city and state officials could have acted quicker to put in place social distancing measures and prepare for the influx of cases other states need to do that now too.“In New York City we had an opportunity to act a little more aggressively sooner. Would that have helped? Possibly” Goodman said.Workers build a makeshift morgue outside of Bellevue Hospital in New York City on March 26 2020. Ron Adar/Echoes Wire/Barcroft Media via Getty ImagesNew York is hardly the only place in the country where coronavirus is spreading and it may be a signal of what’s to come elsewhere. Some states are taking proactive measures — shutting schools ordering social distancing and stay-at-home measures. Others are not — and probably should be.“New York is a warning for the rest of the country” Muldoon said. “Places need to be preparing in case it gets that bad and particularly places that as they’re testing are getting high proportion of positives. Yes they need to get ready.”And in many ways New York City is better equipped than other places to deal with this onslaught. It has more doctors and health facilities than other places which isn’t the case for other parts of the country particularly in rural areas.“The scale is so large here the complexity and the number of hospitals and people that we’re dealing with if we can figure out how to respond to the crisis here then there will be lots of other lessons learned that can be shared with other jurisdictions” said Denis Nash professor of epidemiology at the City University of New York’s School of Public Health.And other parts of the country are already seeing spikes in cases: including Michigan and Louisiana specifically New Orleans. Officials in those states and cities are replicating the warnings voiced by those in New York: They need more protective gear for hospital workers more ventilators more hospital beds to meet the coming surge.“This doesn’t mean the rest of the country is spared” said Nirav Shah a former New York State Health Commissioner and adjunct professor at Stanford University. “Rather we should work collectively to address the problem where it is. Today it is New York. Tomorrow it will be somewhere else and only by coming together as a nation will we get this under control.”

She also says she faced online harassment after coming forward last year. As Ryan Grim reports at the Intercept journalists and others questioned her credibility pointing out favorable comments she had made about Vladimir Putin in a 2018 Medium post perhaps implying that she was a Russian plant.Richard W.

Bernie Sanders. Reade told Vox she initially supported Sen. Elizabeth Warren for president (and also supported Marianne Williamson) but now supports Sanders. And her report has led to allegations by some that she or her supporters are simply trying to throw the election to Sanders — or even to President Donald Trump.Reade acknowledges the concern that her allegation could benefit Trump in the general election since Biden is likely to be the Democratic nominee. Trump himself has been accused of sexual harassment assault or other misconduct by more than 20 women and is being sued for defamation by two of them.“I don’t want Trump to be president” Reade told Vox. But she said she won’t be voting for Biden. “If he’s my president I just can’t fathom it.”Multiple women have said Biden touched them in ways that made them uncomfortableReports of “creepy” behavior by Biden like standing too close to women for photo opportunities have circulated for years treated by some as little more than a joke. But those reports received more serious attention after Lucy Flores a former candidate for lieutenant governor of Nevada wrote in a March 2019 essay at The Cut that Biden had kissed her on the back of the head at a campaign event in 2014.“I couldn’t move and I couldn’t say anything” Flores wrote. “I wanted nothing more than to get Biden away from me.”After that other women spoke out to report similar experiences. Amy Lappos for example said that at a 2009 fundraiser Biden touched her face and rubbed noses with her. And in April Reade told the Union a California newspaper that Biden touched her several times in ways that made her feel uncomfortable and that her duties in his Senate office were reduced after she refused to serve drinks at an event. She said he wanted her there because he liked her legs.Biden did not specifically respond to Reade’s allegation but in a video statement in early April he said “I shake hands I hug people I grab men and women by the shoulders and say ‘You can do this.’” However he also said that “the boundaries of protecting personal space have been reset” and pledged to change his behavior.Since then the allegations by women have not come up much on the debate stage or campaign trail and Biden is likely to be the Democratic nominee for president this year.But on Tuesday Reade’s allegation came to the fore again when Grim reported on its general outline in the Intercept. Then on Wednesday Halper released her interview on her podcast The Katie Halper Show. In it Reade says that in 1993 when she was in her 20s and working for Biden another staffer asked her to bring him a gym bag at the US Capitol.When she did she says he pushed her up against a wall in a secluded area began kissing her and reached under her skirt to penetrate her with his fingers. After she pulled away she says he responded with something along the lines of “Come on man I heard you liked me.” Reade said Biden also said something that sticks with her today: “You’re nothing to me.”Those words affected her “almost more than the assault” she said because she had respected him so much before.In addition to Bedingfield’s statement the Biden campaign also released a statement from Marianne Baker an executive assistant to Biden from 1982 to 2000. “In all my years working for Senator Biden I never once witnessed or heard of or received any reports of inappropriate conduct period — not from Ms. Reade not from anyone” Baker said. “These clearly false allegations are in complete contradiction to both the inner workings of our Senate office and to the man I know and worked so closely with for almost two decades.”Reade for her part said she did not include the assault accusation when she spoke out last year because the harassment was easier to talk about in part because others had witnessed it.“I wanted to share the whole thing but at the same time I was too scared” she said. “I just wasn’t quite ready.”Since then Grim has contacted Reade’s friend and brother both of whom say she told them about the alleged sexual assault by Biden in 1993.“Woefully I did not encourage her to follow up” her brother told the Intercept. “I wasn’t one of her better advocates. I said let it go move on guys are idiots.”Earlier this year though Reade decided she wanted to speak publicly about the assault allegation. She reached out to Time’s Up an anti-harassment organization launched as the Me Too movement rose to prominence to see if she could get legal representation. However Grim reports the organization said it could not support her because Biden is a candidate for federal office and doing so could jeopardize its nonprofit status.Unable to get legal help Reade told Vox she decided to write about her experience on Medium in January saying that “I have not told the whole story of what occurred between Joe Biden and myself.” That led to interest from some smaller media outlets and the interview with Halper she said. “I kind of feel like a weight was lifted off when I did that interview” Reade said. “Now I’m ready to walk away and now everyone wants to talk to me.”Mainstream media initially did not cover Reade’s assault allegationPart of the reason Reade sought legal help she told Vox was that she faced harassment when she initially came forward last year. She also faced scrutiny into her background. In particular critics pointed to that now-deleted 2018 Medium post in which Reade called Putin “a compassionate caring visionary leader” and said “To President Putin I say keep your eyes to the beautiful future and maybe just maybe America will come to see Russia as I do with eyes of love.”In the same post she wrote that she left government work in her 20s in part because “I love Russia with all my heart” and “I could not stand to watch the deception and xenophobia that came from my own American government.”Reade told Vox that when she wrote the praise of Putin she had “watched a bunch of Noam Chomsky” and was working on a novel set in Russia. She says she no longer feels the same way about Putin since learning more about domestic violence in Russia.But “this conversation isn’t about Russia” she told Vox. “Joe Biden wasn’t asking me about my feelings about Russia when he had his hands where they weren’t supposed to be.”Some have dismissed Reade’s allegation because Reade is a Sanders supporter and because it was first publicized by left-wing outlets. As of Friday morning the story had been covered by the Intercept Halper (a vocal Sanders supporter) and Refinery29 but not by the New York Times or Washington Post.To that Reade said “Of course if it’s a choice between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden from my perspective I’m going to pick Bernie Sanders” and added that Sanders supporters were kind to her when she was harassed online after coming forward last year.This time social media conversation may have helped bring attention to Reade’s story with #IBelieveTara and #TimesUpBiden trending this week.Prerna Lal✔@prernaplalStill time to vote for the non-creepy non-harassing Presidential candidate. #TimesUpBiden https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/joe-biden-faces-sexual-assault-211641946.html …Joe Biden Faces Sexual Assault Allegations From A Former StafferFormer Vice President Joe Biden is facing a new sexual assault allegation from a woman named Tara Reade who says she has been trying to share her story since 1993 when it allegedly happened....yahoo.com18581:54 AM - Mar 27 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy791 people are talking about thisThe current social media reactions to Reade’s assault allegation could be broken down into several camps: those who cite her praise of Russia and imply that she or her supporters are working on behalf of Sanders Trump or Putin; and those who cite the need to believe people who come forward to report sexual misconduct.Reade’s report comes at a time when Biden is likely to face Trump in the general election. Before Trump was elected numerous women had accused him of sexual assault and harassment and he was caught on tape bragging about his ability to grab women “by the pussy.” He was elected anyway.While Reade is no fan of Trump she said she is disturbed by the fact that Biden is “running on a platform of character.”“The Uncle Joe thing I never saw that” she said. “He was very strong he was very powerful and he knew it and he used his power to get what he wanted.”Update: This story has been updated to include a statement from the Biden campaign received after publication time."
267,The House just passed a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. It now heads to Trump’s desk.,Li Zhou and Ella Nilsen,Vox,-2,https://www.vox.com/2020/3/27/21196202/house-passes-2-trillion-coronavirus-stimulus-package,The House has officially passed a $2 trillion stimulus package aimed at addressing the economic fallout resulting from efforts to control the coronavirus pandemic. It now heads to President Donald Trump’s desk where he’s expected to sign it.The package offers significant relief for workers small businesses and corporations that have been affected by social distancing measures put in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus including the closures of restaurants bars and schools as well as restrictions on gatherings of more than 10 people.The legislation guarantees direct payment to most adults as well as expanded unemployment insurance for workers who have been laid off. However House Speaker Nancy Pelosi acknowledged this is far from the end of the relief Congress should authorize.“This cannot be our final bill” Pelosi said during a floor speech ahead of the vote on Friday.The bill’s passage follows days of back-and-forth — and occasional conflict — between Senate lawmakers including Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin who played a prominent role in crafting the legislation.Despite the objection of Republican Rep. Thomas Massie (KY) the bill easily passed by a voice vote. A voice vote means the legislation is approved if the majority of lawmakers who are present vocalize their support for it — a test of House protocol during a time when most lawmakers in the lower chamber are working remotely to protect themselves and their staffers from the disease.On Thursday night Democratic and Republican leadership alike suddenly called members back to Washington after Massie suggested he might force a roll call vote in an attempt to defeat the bill. Massie got plenty of blame from colleagues on both sides of the aisle who accused him of needlessly endangering the health of his fellow lawmakers. (Congress already has several confirmed cases of Covid-19 the illness caused by the coronavirus.)President Trump also walloped Massie on Twitter for threatening to hold up the bill calling him a “third rate Grandstander.”Ahead of the vote the House sergeant at arms issued strict guidance about social distancing at the Capitol limiting the number of members on the House floor solely to those who were speaking while debate was taking place. Other measures were taken to reduce the number of people congregating: Lawmakers were also put into alphabetical groups to file in and vote in waves if a recorded vote was needed.The passage of this bill is a notable step in addressing the overwhelming economic impact the pandemic has had though more action could be on the horizon.While the Senate won’t physically return to the Capitol until April 20 Pelosi was hesitant to commit to a date on her side given that lawmakers might have to come back sooner and approve further emergency legislation. Leaders in the two chambers have resisted moving to remote votes up to this point in part because it could conflict with practices established by the Constitution for convening in person.“I think everybody has to be on call for what we need when we need it and we don’t know what that might be” Pelosi told reporters at her Thursday press conference.Here’s what’s in the bipartisan packageA $500 billion loan program for businesses: The biggest sticking point between Democrats and Republicans throughout the negotiations was $500 billion in emergency loans for large businesses and municipalities grappling with the coronavirus outbreak. For instance $50 billion of that money was allotted to passenger airlines according to the Washington Post.Rather than trying to negotiate that figure down Democrats instead negotiated for oversight of the “slush fund.” Instead of giving the Trump administration broad discretion to make the loans there will be a new inspector general in the Treasury Department specifically to oversee these funds as well as a congressional oversight panel to examine how the money is being used.After concerns emerged about Trump personally benefiting from the loans Schumer’s office also announced they secured a provision that will “prohibit businesses controlled by the President Vice President Members of Congress and heads of Executive Departments from receiving loans or investments from Treasury programs.” The children spouses or in-laws of lawmakers and executive officials also cannot receive these loans.Some additional conditions championed by progressives and supported by the public including a requirement for companies to implement a $15 minimum wage have not made it into the final legislation. The package does limit layoffs by companies receiving the aid and bars stock buybacks.“Unemployment insurance on steroids”: Schumer announced Monday afternoon that unemployment insurance will be expanded to grapple with a new surge in claims calling it “unemployment insurance on steroids.” The new bill will increase unemployment insurance by $600 per week for four months. This money is in addition to what states pay as a base unemployment salary. This benefit would extend to gig economy workers freelancers and furloughed workers who are still getting health insurance from their employers but are not receiving a paycheck.Funds for hospitals medical equipment and health care worker protections: The bill contains $130 billion to boost the health care system according to Schumer. Of that $100 billion will go to hospitals $1 billion will go to the Indian Health Service and the remainder will be used to increase medical equipment capacity.Increased aid to state and local governments: Schumer also said about $150 billion of federal money would be allocated for state and local governments that are dealing with the impacts of the crisis in their communities including $8 billion for tribal governments.Direct payments to adults below a certain income threshold: The legislation includes a one-time $1200 check that would be sent to most adults making $75000 or less annually according to past tax returns. A $500 payment would also be sent to cover every child in qualifying households. The final policy marks a significant change from the direct payments initially proposed by Republicans which would have given less to many individuals who do not have taxable income. It now includes the majority of adults who are under the $75000 threshold and phases out the payment as people’s incomes increase.Loans to small businesses: $367 billion in the bill is aimed at providing loans for small businesses according to the Washington Post. Businesses with fewer than 500 employees will also be eligible for a payroll tax credit.
268,New poll finds Fox News viewers think the coronavirus threat is exaggerated,Zack Beauchamp and Christina Animashaun,Vox,-2,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/27/21195940/coronavirus-fox-news-poll-republicans-trump,It’s increasingly clear that the coronavirus is becoming a partisan issue.President Trump against the advice of public health experts is pushing to end social distancing measures by Easter. Democratic officials and governors meanwhile are insisting that these measures stay in place to prevent catastrophe.Fox News has been one of the president’s best allies during the pandemic messaging war with most of its hosts spending the pandemic downplaying its severity and echoing Trump’s positions. “We are scaring people unnecessarily” host Sean Hannity said in one early March monologue. “I see it again as ‘let’s bludgeon Trump again with this new hoax.’”How much does Fox’s drumbeat of coronavirus misinformation matter for its largely Republican largely older audience? A new national poll from Survey 160 and Gradient Metrics sheds some disturbing light on this question — showing that Fox viewers are much less likely to take the pandemic seriously even as compared to other Republicans.The survey fielded between March 13 and 16 asked a representative sample of registered voters two questions about their approach to the pandemic: whether they personally were staying home from work and whether they thought the media was overstating the threat from the pandemic.The following charts show the results for Republicans divided up by those who reported watching any Fox News programming in the past 24 hours and those who did not. The gaps are striking:Christina Animashaun/VoxChristina Animashaun/VoxSurvey 160 also conducted the same poll among Republicans who lived in Washington state an area hit by the coronavirus earlier than most of the country and found roughly similar responses. This suggests that the coronavirus’s uneven geographic spread isn’t the reason for the divide.It’s important to note that these results don’t prove that watching Fox News is directly causing its viewers to be more skeptical. It could be that the Republicans who choose to watch Fox News are more hardline partisans and thus more likely to believe the line that’s politically convenient for Trump. Or there could be factors other than geography at play that the survey didn’t account for.But it also could be that Fox hosts are persuading their viewers of some very unsafe things; we just don’t know either way.The poll was also conducted during a period (March 13 to 16) when Trump had just declared a national emergency over the coronavirus and in general was projecting far more concern about the epidemic than he is currently and when Fox quickly pivoted to embracing the president’s line.On Hannity’s March 13 show for example the host shifted from bashing dire warnings about the virus as Democratic hoaxes to praising the administration’s strong response to the crisis.“Tonight we are witnessing what will be a massive paradigm shift in the future of disease control and prevention” he said. “The federal government state governments private businesses top hospitals all coming together under the president’s leadership to stem the tide of the coronavirus.”This means that if Fox News really is causing its viewers to be skeptical of the pandemic — and we have good social scientific research suggesting Fox does influence its viewers’ political behavior — then this could well be an underestimate of how many Republicans are still willing to go to work and ignore other social distancing measures.Given that Fox’s audience skews disproportionately older that should make the network’s executives think twice about the lives endangered by their hosts’ stubborn willingness to say what the president needs them to.“Fox News is reaching a uniquely vulnerable audience both because of their age and because of that audience’s attitudes [toward] the coronavirus outbreak” Kevin Collins the chief research officer of Survey 160 said in a press release. “With that power comes a responsibility to ensure the public health message of social distancing and self-quarantining is heard clearly.”
269,Cuomo says he needs 30000 ventilators to avoid many coronavirus deaths. Trump doesn’t buy it.,Aaron Rupar,Vox,-2,https://www.vox.com/2020/3/27/21196789/trump-hannity-interview-cuomo-coronavirus-ventilators,"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said this week that his state will need at least 30000 ventilators to make sure everyone requiring hospitalization from the coronavirus is cared for properly. But during an interview on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show on Thursday President Donald Trump said he doesn’t believe him.“I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being in said in some areas are just bigger than they’re going to be. I don’t believe you need 40000 or 30000 ventilators” Trump said. “You know you go into major hospitals sometimes they’ll have two ventilators and now all of the sudden they’re saying ‘Can we order 30000 ventilators?’”The president’s comments represent more than an idle factually dubious observation coming from someone who has already demonstrated he doesn’t understand why Covid-19 (the disease caused by coronavirus) is a unique public health crisis. They underscore the danger of his increasingly contentious relationship with the states on the front lines of the pandemic — particularly with those led by Democratic governors.The president’s active help is necessary — Cuomo said on Tuesday that “the only way we can obtain these ventilators is from the federal government” and characterized getting more of them as “the difference between life and death literally” for people in his state.Trump however doesn’t seem to think he has an obligation to come through.Aaron Rupar✔@atruparReplying to @atrupar""I don't believe you need 40000 or 30000 ventilators.

In a string of angry tweets Trump demanded that General Motors “GET GOING” on manufacturing “40000 much needed Ventilators” — demands illustrating just how incoherent he can be.)Trump’s comments to Hannity about ventilators was just one of many he made during the interview indicating he’s trying to shift blame for the coronavirus crisis onto Democratic governors who have dared to criticize him for the coronavirus outbreaks in their states.At another point Trump went on the attack against Washington’s Jay Inslee and Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer — whose name he couldn’t remember — saying “We don’t like to see complaints.” He even went as far as to suggest that he’s thinking twice about granting Whitmer’s request for a federal emergency declaration in her state despite having granted others for states around the country.Here’s what Trump said followed by the video:People like Governor Inslee — he should be doing more he shouldn’t be relying on the federal government. Governor Inslee that’s the state of Washington. He was a failed presidential candidate and you know he’s always complaining.And your governor of Michigan I mean she’s not stepping up. I don’t know if she knows what’s going on but all she does is sit there and blame the federal government. She doesn’t get it done and we send her a lot. Now she wants a declaration of emergency and uh we’ll have to make a decision on that. But Michigan is a very important state. I love the people of Michigan what they do. I’m the one — I’m bringing back many many car factories into Michigan. She is a new governor and it’s not been pleasant.By the way most governors have been fantastic. I have to tell you whether it’s Democrat or Republican. But we’ve really had some trouble with the state of Washington. The governor — you know he ran for president didn’t exactly do well he got zero. And we’ve had a big problem with the young a woman governor from — you know who I’m talking about — from Michigan. So we can’t ah we don’t like to see the complaints.Aaron Rupar✔@atruparReplying to @atruparTrump bashes Gov. Inslee and Gov.

During a conference call between the president and governors on Thursday he responded to Trump describing the federal government as the “backup” for states in crisis by telling him that “we don’t need a backup. We need a Tom Brady.” That comment seemed to still be rankling Trump hours later.Along the same lines Whitmer said during an MSNBC appearance on March 17 that “the federal government did not take this seriously early enough” and added “To hear the leader of the federal government tells us to work around the federal government because it’s too slow is kind of mind-boggling to be honest.” Trump was apparently watching and responded a short time later with a tweet blasting her.Donald J. Trump✔@realDonaldTrumpFailing  Michigan Governor must work harder and be much more proactive. We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand with Michigan!103K9:27 AM - Mar 17 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy52.2K people are talking about thisOn Friday Whitmer told a Michigan radio station that following Trump’s comments about her to Hannity “what I’ve gotten back is that vendors with whom we’ve procured contracts — They’re being told not to send stuff to Michigan. It’s really concerning.”“I’ve been uniquely singled out” Whitmer added. “I don’t go into personal attacks I don’t have time for that I don’t have energy for that frankly. All of our focus has to be on Covid-19.”Trump’s interview with Hannity came two days after he said during a previous Fox News appearance that he’s willing to help blue-state governors who are struggling to contain coronavirus outbreaks — but only if they’re willing to stop criticizing him in exchange.“It’s a two-way street” Trump said. “They have to treat us well also. They can’t say ‘Oh gee we should get this we should get that.’”Trump’s idea that he’s only obligated to do things for people whom he doesn’t perceive as being on his team if they behave as he wants has manifested itself repeatedly throughout his term in office — consider his alleged demand that Ukraine investigate the Bidens in order to receive foreign aid or the infamous image of him tossing rolls of paper towels at Puerto Ricans whose lives had just been upended by a deadly hurricane while he feuded with San Juan’s Democratic mayor. But in the context of the coronavirus outbreak this mode of transactional thinking could cost lives.Trump doesn’t seem to understand how the coronavirus could cause hospitals to be overwhelmedDuring other parts of the interview with Hannity Trump again expressed eagerness to relax social distancing measures as soon as possible claiming falsely that “everybody wants to go back to work.” (Polling indicates that 74 percent of voters actually favor more stringent social distancing measures until the outbreak is under control.)Trump rested his argument on the dubious claim that the Covid-19 mortality rate “is much much better [lower] in our way than people were thinking at the beginning. Because we were hearing 3 4 5 percent.”But what Trump doesn’t seem to understand is that the mortality rate is likely to spike if health care professionals get sick themselves because they don’t have proper protective gear or if hospitals don’t have enough ventilators to treat everyone. In this way he fundamentally doesn’t get how public health crises work and seems unwilling to get informed.So instead of doing all he can to provide potentially lifesaving help to states Trump is passing the buck to private businesses while urging governors to fend for themselves. That’s produced a world in which states bid against one another for needed supplies and in the process drive up prices.That approach could result in preventable deaths in places like New York and Michigan where hospitals have already developed protocols for rationing ventilators. Trump however seems to view that as the cost of doing business with Democratic governors who have dared to criticize his administration’s flailing coronavirus response."
270,How the US stacks up to other countries in confirmed coronavirus cases,Dylan Scott and Rani Molla,Vox,-2,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/13/21178289/confirmed-coronavirus-cases-us-countries-italy-iran-singapore-hong-kong,The United States has now become the country with the most Covid-19 cases in the world overtaking China and Italy.America has been testing people for the coronavirus at a slower rate than most other developed countries yet the number of people diagnosed with Covid-19 in the US has still been rising steadily more quickly than our peers abroad. We don’t yet know the full extent of the outbreak but America has quickly become one of the epicenters for the coronavirus pandemic.The US health system was less prepared for a pandemic than those of other wealthy nations. A high uninsured rate high out-of-pocket health care costs and low medical system capacity combined to make the country more vulnerable to a pathogen before the coronavirus ever came to our shores. America’s lax response in the early days of the outbreak only compounded those problems.“Everyone working in this space would agree that no matter how you measure it the US is far behind on this” Jen Kates director of global health and HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation told Vox of the coronavirus response.Here’s how the number of confirmed cases in the US compares to select other countries based on days since each country reached 100 confirmed cases according to data we analyzed from the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus dashboard.Note that the chart uses a log scale meaning that the Y-axis goes up in equal distances between 100 1000 and 10000 to mimic the exponential rate at which a contagion like the coronavirus spreads.Here’s that same chart on a traditional linear scale.As of March 27 the Johns Hopkins research data shows more than 550000 confirmed cases worldwide about 86000 of which were in the US. The actual number of cases is likely much higher. Nearly 25000 people have died across the world from Covid-19 including more than 1000 in the United States.As you can see the US has now surpassed Iran Italy and even China in total number of confirmed cases and has far outpaced places like Hong Kong and Singapore where the governments mobilized more quickly. Japan’s case numbers also appear to be quite low though the government there has been criticized over not having enough tests to properly judge the true number of cases. On the other hand the number of deaths in Japan is small compared to the hardest-hit countries suggesting better containment there than some European nations or the US.As America implements dramatic measures to control the spread of Covid-19 with schools and businesses closing and general social distancing underway the country still struggling to understand the full scope of the outbreak because of the slow start of testing. It has undeniably hindered the US response.“The testing failure is putting additional strain on our already challenged health system” Cynthia Cox director of the Peterson-Kaiser Health System Tracker said. “The combination of all of these factors will make the US worse off than similar countries.”Testing is not only important because it gets people diagnosed and appropriate treatment if they do have an infection; it also establishes how widespread a virus actually is. Experts know the size of the problem they know the rate at which people are being hospitalized or dying and they can follow its movements.But the United States has faltered in rolling out coronavirus tests putting America far behind its economic peers in tracing the outbreak. A manufacturing problem with the test kits that were initially sent out in the field and a delay in approving commercial tests set the nation back in stopping or slowing down Covid-19.Even as testing and testing capacity has ramped up in the US as of March 27 America is still lagging behind other countries hit hard by the virus in the share of its population being tested. There have been about 600000 tests conducted in the US for its population of 329 million.The US started behind the rest of the world in responding to Covid-19 — and is still catching up.
271,Who Is Our Best Governer in a Crisis?,JIM NEWELL,Slate,-2,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/coronavirus-governors-cuomo-dewine-desantis.html,The SurgeWelcome to this week’s edition of the Surge where this time we’re ranking the most boring species of politician found in the natural world except for when there’s a pandemic out there: governors.Governors—or as I like to call them Coronavirus Governors—have been getting so much attention in the media during this crisis for a few reasons. One there’s no national leadership to compete with. Two they’re the ones actually dealing with the situation on the ground with limited resources and don’t have the luxury of time to tweet nonsense from the toilet for four hours each morning about how the dental implant magnate from Palm Beach County thinks the coronavirus is a hoax. There’s also not much space for ideology when you’re managing a crisis and among the most effective governors we’ve seen the responses flatten the partisan divide.Be forewarned: This is a praise-heavy edition of the Surge something it gives us no pleasure to report. But it’s not all bad news: We leave space for making fun of Ron DeSantis too.Andrew CuomoOK he’s good now. Could be bad later. But good now.The Surge feels like it hears each day from New Yorkers whose Twitter feeds for the past decade had been extended hate-poems against Andrew Cuomo about how impressed they’ve been with his coronavirus response. The reception from much of the media and in particular the cable news networks that broadcast his daily press conferences in their entirety has been exponentially more laudatory. Online betting sites are now giving Cuomo better odds at winning the Democratic presidential nomination than Bernie Sanders an actual candidate in the race. And it’s true: Cuomo has been impressive and he’s shown that the public won’t simply grade leaders’ responses by the number of cases under their watch. People want honesty and lucidity and Cuomo is blunt in assessing what’s happened so far what trajectory New York is on what the state has been able to accomplish what it’s trying to do next and where it needs help from the federal government. He’s managed to stay on top of a state crisis that would have devoured others and even managed to set aside some time for his family.Rank 2Mike DeWineWho’s “boring” now eh?The Ohio governor has been in one public office or another since the Carter administration and has never been particularly adored for his work. He is a boring safe establishment Republican. But now it’s time for Safe Governor Grandpa to come out of his shell! This devilish rogue defied a court order and stopped a presidential primary scheduled for the following day on the grounds of a public health emergency. The move was so cavalier that the Ohio Supreme Court eventually agreed with him writing in a ruling (paraphrase/fabrication) that “it was so cool when he did that we have no choice but to let Mr. Not Boring but Actually Cool follow through with that” while asking for an autographed photo of DeWine wearing a leather jacket and riding a motorcycle. What’s not as cool is that DeWine’s state is one of a few that has deemed abortion a “nonessential procedure.” He is in other words still a Republican.Rank 3Gavin NewsomCalifornia seems OK-ish?Trying not to jinx it here but as we look at the 40000-plus coronavirus cases in New York state it seems … not bad that California a state of 40 million people has about 3000 cases? That could change. But Gov. Gavin Newsom has been perhaps the most aggressive big-state governor in seeking to stop the spread of the virus. He issued the country’s first statewide stay-at-home order and isn’t raising false hopes about how he might lift it soon. He’s also worked with banks and credit unions to suspend residential mortgage payments and ensured that missed payments won’t affect credit ratings. (Doing more for renters would be nice Gavin.) The situation in California is going to get worse especially as unemployment claims have surged past 1 million in just two weeks and that nice budget surplus the state had built up fritters away. But moves Newsom has made that seemed extreme when first announced might protect the state from its nightmare scenario.Rank 4Andy BeshearCongrats on owning Tennessee.The story of how Responsible Kentucky has done better than Slacker Tennessee went viral this week bringing much shame on Tennessee. This story may ignore random exigencies of life and be too cute to be entirely real. But let’s tell it anyway. On March 6 Kentucky got its first confirmed case of the bug and Gov. Andy Beshear immediately issued a state of emergency shutting down bars and restaurants. Lousy Tennessee meanwhile got its first case on March 5 and Gov. Bill Lee waited a week before declaring an emergency. As we write Kentucky has far fewer cases per capita than Tennessee one of various Southern states where the virus is spreading. Beshear can’t stop every young person from throwing a “coronavirus party”—no governor can. But his management of the crisis gets him on our list.Rank 5Larry HoganNot saying he likes this situation …… but for a Republican governor who’s maintained his popularity in a blue state in part by adequately separating himself from Donald Trump and the national Republican Party this is kind of his wheelhouse. While Trump was still deep in his “it’s just a lil’ seasonal flu” phase Hogan was locking down Maryland and giving sober Cuomo-esque daily updates on the situation in his state which has not gotten out of hand. He’s earned praise from all corners of Maryland—and when Trump says something stupid like “it’s just a virus let’s all go to church on Easter!!!” he does not miss opportunities to swat him down.Rank 6Ron DeSantisPhew! Let’s talk about bad governors.Thank God we made it. We made it!!! It’s finally time to talk about the governor of Florida Ron DeSantis. Two years ago he was a back-bencher in the House Freedom Caucus whom no one cared about; now he’s the executive of the third-most populous state in the country. The coronavirus has been licking its chops just thinking about this state where a full 110 percent of the population is 87 years old. DeSantis didn’t do anything as hordes of spring breakers traveled to Florida’s overcrowded beaches one of various ways in which the state is lagging behind others in its response despite being home to one of the most vulnerable populations. Florida’s numbers are now well on the rise a situation for which DeSantis blames New York. He ran as a Trump lackey and now he gets to govern as one. Best of luck to Florida.Rank 7Kevin StittCongratulations on being chided by Donald Trump for not taking this seriously enough.Sticking with the negative: The Oklahoma governor earned more national fame than he might care for when he tweeted on March 14 “Eating with my kids and all my fellow Oklahomans at the @CollectiveOKC. It's packed tonight!” While Stitt deleted the tweet his spokesperson did say afterward that “the governor will continue to take his family out to dinner and to the grocery store without living in fear and encourages Oklahomans to do the same.” When Trump was asked about the tweet he wasn’t particular harsh but he did say he “would disagree” with the advice and that “it’s probably better that you don’t.” It’s really something to be gently criticized by Donald Trump for not taking coronavirus seriously enough.
272,New Orleans Faces Another Disaster, JASON BERRY,Slate,-2,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/new-orleans-coronavirus.html,As massive coronavirus shutdowns took hold in California and New York down in Louisiana this past Sunday Gov. John Bel Edwards announced that the state had the world’s fastest growth rate of confirmed cases and ordered home sheltering until April 13.Three days later with 1795 positive cases and 65 deaths in the state attributed to COVID-19 the Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate reported that Orleans Parish (which encompasses the city) had the sixth-highest rate among U.S. counties all the rest being in New York. After public officials protested that the state had not been included in President Donald Trump’s disaster declarations that covered New York California and Washington state the White House added Louisiana to its declaration on Wednesday clearing the way for federal assistance.As Louisiana fluctuates in the top ranks of per capita cases New Orleans is the epicenter of the Gulf South with 827 confirmed cases and 38 deaths attributed to COVID-19 as of Thursday morning according to the state health department.Edwards hammered home a bleak message. “I’m going to say that again so people can understand what I just said” the governor emphasized citing the state’s skyrocketing coronavirus cases. “What happened in Italy is they started too late. People didn’t socially distance. … And the world learned that you have to act fast and in places that may not look like they have a problem yet.”The major New Orleans COVID-19 cluster is at Lambeth House an affluent retirement high-rise that also has a nursing wing; the building overlooks a bend of the Mississippi River levee with terraces and balconies affording scenic views. Forty-two residents have tested positive for COVID-19 according to health officials. Three of the 11 deaths attributed to the virus at Lambeth were retired physicians who attended elite Carnival balls like many of the independent living residents according to obituaries and interviews with families of residents. All of the deceased were men. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta has a research team at Lambeth House seeking epidemiological data.Unlike the 2005 impact of Hurricane Katrina flooding which hit hardest in poorer downriver wards the coronavirus’ tentacles first reached into an elite enclave in the wealthy Uptown neighborhood. Lambeth residents pay a $275000 registration fee with 90 percent refundable to designated heirs upon the person’s demise unless the resident withdraws first. Monthly fees start at $2971 depending on apartment size according to its website.Against the background of a leap-frogging death toll the three-week Mardi Gras parade season that ended Feb. 25 is now widely seen as a rolling vector infecting untold numbers of revelers in the vast crowds. The city population of 393000 more than triples with tourists and visitors during the last four days of parades parties jammed nightclubs and high-end balls. Three of the Lambeth deceased attended the upper-crust Krewe of Hermes ball the week before Fat Tuesday according to a Lambeth family member.Among those deaths now attributed to COVID-19 Roland W. Lewis 68 was a longtime Mardi Gras Indian leader and founder of House of Dance and Feathers a small museum with displays of the parading culture in a Lower Ninth Ward neighborhood.Other prominent figures have fallen ill. New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton and Roman Catholic Archbishop Gregory Aymond have tested positive. So has Phil Frazier the fabled tuba player and founder of Rebirth Brass Band.Coronavirus testing sites are up and running at several places in the city. But with testing kit orders backlogged the results are slow to come. Locals who came back 15 years ago after the massive flooding to dig out and rebuild have been thrown into survival mode once again.Food distribution outlets are popping up on St. Claude Avenue a thoroughfare of local bohemia among other locations in a city where nearly a third of the people live at or below the poverty level.The virus’s lethal threat fell across the city like a fog of déjà vu stirring memories of 2005 and the flooding that engulfed 80 percent of the city an area seven times the size of the island of Manhattan. Residents bracing for the virus invoked the resilience of people who came back dug out and rebuilt over the next several years: We have been here before and we’ll get through it again.George Ingmire a sound engineer for film sets and music productions and a popular deejay on WWOZ FM the city’s roots radio station compared the social distancing orders to the massive displacement of people across the metro area caused by the vast flooding after Katrina. “It’s like an evacuation without an evacuation” he said.Ingmire is one of the tens of thousands of New Orleanians in the gig economy—freelancers of all stripes artists writers people working in music film the once-flourishing art galleries sous-chefs waitstaff and food subcontractors—who are once again being thrown into a scramble for existence.Many in Ingmire’s position normally don’t qualify for unemployment benefits and hope that Congress’ relief package will provide a lifeline. Ingmire said he lost jobs totaling $3500 over the past two weeks.In response to workers like Ingmire in the gig economy the New Orleans Business Alliance created a relief fund. New Orleans Saints owner Gayle Benson donated $1 million to the Greater New Orleans Foundation for assistance to people outside the sphere of unemployment relief.Katrina’s impact was so shattering that on the third day of the flood with the vast majority of residents evacuated a beleaguered WWL radio reporter Dave Cohen assessing the widespread damage voiced a collective angst: “New Orleans is over. Where do I live?”But as the city slowly drained and Congress moved at an aching pace on a relief package people came back to dig out and rebuild. The reporting on the flood and its aftermath by the Times-Picayune won two Pulitzer Prizes much of it by reporters who lost their homes.Today’s descendant of that paper the Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate won another Pulitzer two years ago for local reporting yet now its editor Peter Kovacs a veteran of the 2005 coverage sent a candid email to subscribers seeking donations and stating “our journalism was so vivid because we were both covering and experiencing the event simultaneously. The current coronavirus crisis feels very much the same.“We have a staff of about 120 journalists the largest in Louisiana and every one of us is living and covering the health emergency. We have people self-quarantining and others working on the front lines visiting the medical facilities where they are caring for the sick. We have staff members with children unexpectedly at home sagging from boredom. We face the same kind of uncertainties as workers in other businesses and we are watching nervously.”According to an internal memo quoted in the Washington Post the paper is issuing temporary furloughs to “about a tenth of our 400-member workforce and the rest of us will begin four-day workweeks. … The furloughs will chiefly impact people who cover sports and social events which have been curtailed.” The paper also instituted a 20 percent pay cut for all employees.A city that’s adept in costume and mask-making has shown a grassroots resilience. Volunteers are organizing supply drives and sewing face masks for nurses and medical workers. IATSE Local 478—a union of film set workers part of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Moving Pictures Technicians Artists and Allied Crafts—coordinated with the crew of NCIS: New Orleans and local costume and prop houses to manufacture and deliver some 30000 gloves thousands of N95 masks and respirators hundreds of isolation gowns coveralls caps soap sanitizer alcohol wipes personal toiletries and full face shields to first responders and medical staff at local health facilities that are stretched to the brink.Similarly distilleries are converting their operations to produce hand sanitizer instead of booze the Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate reported.But the flipside of this homespun mentality is a rooted indifference to politics. For hard-pressed officials it’s hard to persuade people steeped in a culture of open air music festivals cookouts and parades of all kinds through the seasons to stay inside. Mayor LaToya Cantrell canceled the St. Patrick’s Day and Mardi Gras Indian Super Sunday parades on March 17. Crowds took to the streets on St. Patrick’s Day anyway. “Use your head stop the spread” she insisted calling for social distancing a week before Edwards’ statewide order.As the social distancing blanket wrinkled with boredom and fear fell across a city whose DNA trumpets a celebration of life lived large revelers are slowly learning to adapt. Jazz musicians like Jon Cleary and Tom McDermott have taken to livestreaming music from their homes.New Orleans may be accustomed to adapting to calamity but the suddenly silent streets are creating bizarre new problems. A viral video from last week shows scores of rats scrambling in the middle of the typically packed Bourbon Street outside an empty restaurant. With restaurants operating takeout only the garbage dumpsters in which rats feasted on leftovers held thinner pickings.“For most people it was obvious that the separation must last until the end of the epidemic” Albert Camus writes in The Plague his 1947 novel of bubonic plague spread by rats in the Algerian seacoast town of Oran. Coronavirus springs from a different source but the parallels with social distancing are striking. Camus writes: “This drastic clean-cut deprivation and our complete ignorance of what the future held in store had taken us unawares.”Bourbon Street is empty of the nightly flow of humankind. City workers are resorting to putting rat bait in sewers.Yet across town a survivor emerged. On a balmy morning Uptown 77-year-old George Krall a retired school teacher and Lambeth House resident was taking a walk outside after two weeks of self-quarantine due to a positive test for the virus. He credited the nurse practitioner who checked on him taking his temperature as he took Tylenol. “Now I’m allowed to leave my apartment” Krall told the Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate. “I’ve gone two weeks with no fever no symptoms.”
273,The House Tries to Figure Out How to Pass the Senate Pandemic Relief Bill Without Voting,JIM NEWELL,Slate,-2,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/the-house-plots-its-options-for-passing-senate-coronavirus-bill.html,Assuming the Senate can finalize language on its $2 trillion coronavirus relief legislation and sort through last-minute senatorial ego trips the package will soon clear the chamber and migrate to the House. Then it’s up to House leaders to figure out how to move it through the chamber swiftly without any mischief that might require the majority of House members to fly back to Washington.The House recessed and members flew home after passing a separate $100 billion coronavirus relief bill nearly two weeks ago leaving the Senate to write the next substantially larger part of the plan. Now the House leaders need to figure out how to turn their tacit agreement to go along with the Senate’s plan into legislative action.Their preference for passing the bill would be through unanimous consent in which a member asks for everyone to agree to the bill and in the absence of an objection the agreement would become official. Similarly the House could try to pass the measure by voice vote: The speaker asks for the yeas then the nays and the loudest side (in practice whichever side the speaker chooses) wins.But a single determined member can obstruct either of these options. A unanimous consent request can by definition be stopped if any member objects. On a voice vote meanwhile any member can raise a point of order that a quorum—a majority of the House—is not present forcing a roll call vote.These and other possibilities were outlined in a report released earlier this week by the House Rules Committee which along with leadership is still sorting through how the chamber should proceed. Similar problems materialize with other ideas the report brainstorms. One option called “enhanced unanimous consent” would increase the number of members required to object to a unanimous consent request. Sounds great! But such a new rule would first have to itself be adopted by unanimous consent to which a lone rogue could of course still object. There’s the same problem with proxy voting by which an absent member would authorize another member to vote for them: You first have to successfully adopt proxy voting.Another option that’s garnered a lot of public attention is remote voting something that neither Speaker Nancy Pelosi nor Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has shown much interest in. The Rules Committee report suggests it’s worthy of more study but essentially not feasible in the immediate future. First it would entail serious security and logistical concerns before such a system could be up and running; secondly there are yet more constitutional concerns about what it means for members to “assemble” and be “Present” in a “place.” While those constitutional concerns aren’t insurmountable they are litigable and it’s reasonable to expect that opponents of some piece of legislation passed under remote voting would tie the question in courts. And again: You can’t pass remote voting with everyone out of town except for the one person sticking around to object.So how is the House going to pass this $2 trillion sucker as leaders hope to do without flying hundreds of old people back to the coronavirus mothership that is the United States Capitol—something that would likely only delay and not block passage anyway?With unanimous consent and voice vote as the most realistic though risky methods House leaders will be scanning their radars for potential disruptors. They held numerous conference calls with members on Wednesday walking through expected pieces of the Senate legislation. They’re explanatory sure but also a means of temperature taking: Which blocs of members (Progressives Blue Dogs the Freedom Caucus) might have serious issues with pieces of it—and more specifically which individual members might be just mad enough to come back to Washington go to the House floor object to proceedings on one ground or another require a recorded vote and earn the enmity of their colleagues for eternity?There are candidates to watch. On the Republican side Texas Reps. Louie Gohmert and Chip Roy have a history of either threatening to block unanimous consent requests or blocking them. Michigan Rep. Justin Amash the ex-Republican independent is disgusted with the legislation but said Wednesday that he wouldn’t block a unanimous consent request as it “merely delays the inevitable.” On the Democratic side meanwhile New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez told CNN that she was “open” to calling for a recorded vote “if necessary.”“With the health risks of travel there is no easy choice here” Ocasio-Cortez said. “But essential workers are showing up and putting their health at risk every day and if the final text of a bill is set up to hurt them it may be something we have to do.”And then there’s Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie a consistent thorn in Republican leadership’s side who has stuck around to block unanimous consent legislation in the past. There was I was told Wednesday afternoon a rumor on the Hill that Massie was in D.C. (One imagines Hill leadership staffers scouring alleys throughout the city while Massie cools his heels in a safe house.) Massie’s staff did not respond to inquiries as to his whereabouts but Massie did confirm to the Washington Post early Wednesday evening that he would be in D.C. on Thursday. He wasn’t ruling out any of his options.It was Amash though who may have pointed toward a way to resolve this in the same tweets in which he said he wouldn’t block a unanimous consent request.Justin Amash✔@justinamash · Mar 25 2020This bipartisan deal is a raw deal for the people. It does far too little for those who need the most help while providing hundreds of billions in corporate welfare massively growing government inhibiting economic adaptation and widening the gap between the rich and the poor.Justin Amash✔@justinamashOnly the Democratic Caucus and Republican Conference can decide the outcome.

Those statements or symbolic votes still wouldn’t perfectly simulate the results of a proper in-person vote. A good number of members who might vote for the legislation if they were there in person with the economy on the line and with leadership’s guns to their heads might say they reject the deal over one provision or another when their submitted statement or proxy vote doesn’t actually matter. It would be a move that allows the legislation to pass while members cowardly look out for themselves.In other words it might hit the sweet spot.
274,The Senate Coronavirus Bill Is Not Going to Be Enough,DANIEL CARPENTER,Slate,-2,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/senate-coronavirus-bill-is-not-enough.html,On Wednesday Senate negotiators announced that they had reached a deal on a $2 trillion stimulus package in an effort to bolster the economy that has been devastated by measures meant to attempt to contain the coronavirus outbreak in the United States. Our new “big government” consensus though is as shortsighted as it is striking.Writers and politicians across the spectrum have begun to call for government at all levels to take a major if not massive role in combating the coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing global recession. All of this is necessary.Yet big government can’t just mean sending money the tactic the current stimulus measure is centered upon. The government we forge for this crisis has to have some permanence has to provide jobs and not just income and has to have a human face. The increasingly popular plans for universal basic income support—whether temporary or permanent—amount to an income stimulus not necessarily a jobs stimulus. If everybody saves their $2000 check and/or spends it on services provided by slender capital-intensive corporations like Amazon then employment will not rebound and economic inequality is likely to get worse not better. Even former Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed Hundt’s laudable call for investment in our health care system largely consists of Congress writing checks without directly creating new jobs. And the current stimulus plan embeds the dangerous policy assumption that once the worst of the coronavirus is over all American jobs will come back just like they did before the crisis.An expansion of America’s public service at all levels of government must be central to any counter-epidemic and counter-recession plan. It would provide more durable support for the American economy than a near-term stimulus and it would also reduce economic inequality while diminishing the scope and effects of corporate lobbying. Let’s consider the following short-term and long-term solutions.In the near term Congress could authorize critical federal agencies to hire essential workers not just for the next few weeks but for the coming year or more of transition and could designate block grants to state governments so that they and local governments can do the same. The following public sector jobs will be critical:• Public health workers (nurses technicians physicians social work and mental health workers). All of these positions will suffer from short supply and exhaustion in the coming weeks and months. Federal and state governments are in the best position to create a surge education training and hiring plan.• Workers to manufacture and distribute medical supplies. Congress should authorize national and state governments to hire workers to create both temporary and permanent hospital infrastructure.• Analysts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Food and Drug Administration and other federal agencies. If tech and financial firms are laying off their workers these federal agencies should begin hiring them. From disease modeling to website development to fielding calls federal and state needs will be great in the months ahead if we are to effectively combat the pandemic.• Unemployment and job training offices. The crush of unemployment lays bare not just the miserly character of our safety net but its organizational weakness as well. State governments are being crippled by the onslaught of unemployment applications and longer-run job training programs will depend heavily upon state and local programs.In the short run the kinds of jobs required for expanding government capacity will be limited because of social distancing requirements. Of course the need for training opens up the possibility of further job creation whether by the hiring agencies themselves by state and local schools and technical centers or by universities that have repurposed some of their functions.When the first wave of the pandemic subsides and we begin rebuilding our economy Americans need to think about how to adapt to the later waves the next epidemic and a new economic reality. Government jobs in the following areas will be essential.• Medical supply stockpiling. Sadly our country does not have enough ventilators for the coming crush of COVID-19-related hospitalizations. That cannot be an excuse for failing to invest for the next wave of this virus and for the next virus epidemic when it comes. Since any ventilator stockpile would need to be maintained depreciation monitored and machines transported around the country a public program would employ manufacturers mechanics programmers and truckers. There is no reason government itself cannot provide many of these jobs directly.• Local and state public health agencies including laboratories and mental health. Sadly as professors Amy Kapczynski and Gregg Gonsalves have documented our public health capacity has withered in recent decades. Federal and state investments in public health workers including social workers and mental health professionals can begin filling that gap.• Transport infrastructure. For years there has been a call for a major new infrastructure project yet nothing substantial has come out of Washington in over a decade. A plan for identifying bridges ports and roads in need of reconstruction would employ manual laborers engineers transport workers and surveyors. State transportation agencies could hire for these purposes as could the Department of Transportation.• Alternative energy infrastructure development. Call it a Green New Deal if you want to. But planning and rollout for a more expansive grid of electric cars solar panels and wind farms necessitates hiring workers.• Congressional committees and offices. No I’m not kidding. A bipartisan group of scholars and observers has noted that the capacity of our Article 1 branch of government has withered. This would be an excellent time to invest in that capacity especially in nonpartisan offices like the Congressional Research Service the Congressional Budget Office and the Government Accountability Office.* While we’re at it bring back the Office of Technology Assessment. And these jobs need not all or mostly be in Washington. We could expand employment in congressional districts and states.If the economic and health reasons for stimulus through public sector hiring are not enough consider two other benefits of government hiring. First an infrastructure plan that relies entirely or largely on contractors will likely exacerbate the social and economic inequality that has torn our country apart. Government jobs provide solid benefits and limit top-level executive pay. Second the onslaught of lobbying currently witnessed on Capitol Hill is happening precisely because the government is handing out checks. Direct federal employment would be subject to far less lobbying as the corporate payoffs are not nearly as high.A nation that launched the Works Progress Administration the Civilian Conservation Corps the agricultural extension service and the Tennessee Valley Authority has the precedent to confront a new crisis with true public sector capacity. All that’s currently missing is the imagination and the backbone.
275,Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren Should Be the Faces of the Democratic Coronavirus Response,BEN MATHIS-LILLEY,Slate,-2,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/democratic-coronavirus-response-amy-klobuchar-elizabeth-warren.html,While Democrats’ substantive response to the coronavirus has been critically acclaimed they need a visible response as well. To simplify the situation but only by a little the party needs someone who can consistently appear on cable news as soon as Donald Trump is done talking to undo whatever damage the president has just done to public health.Joe Biden as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee would be the obvious choice to embody the opposition but the dynamic and clear conveyance of information in a fluid situation is not one of his current strong suits. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer seem to have done well in negotiating a sizable coronavirus relief package with Mitch McConnell and the Trump administration but are not that well liked by the general public and are busy doing caucus leader stuff. Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are well known and well liked by many people but not as well liked by others including some in their own party. And Sanders is still officially competing against Biden for the nomination albeit in a low key. Others appear on the news here and there but none of them is officially speaking on behalf of the party as a whole in the way Trump does (to an alarmingly effective degree it seems) for Republicans.Why not turn over the party’s messaging about the pandemic to the two-woman team of Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren?Yes this recalls the New York Times’ editorial board’s self-defeating recommendation that its readers vote for either Warren or Klobuchar depending on their risk tolerance. But what was impossible in a zero-sum presidential race would be natural on both optics and substance for the daunting collaborative task at hand. Both senators have high current visibility thanks to their presidential campaigns and while neither won the nomination they were regarded as sharp debaters and were able to cut through the noise generated by a 20-plus-person field enough to make what was essentially the final round of the primary. They have relevant reputations for being practical in slightly different senses—Klobuchar for being able to work with right-leaning voters and legislators and Warren for her mastery of detail.They are also already publicly engaged with the matter at hand. Warren’s suggestions for preventing the stimulus package from becoming a corporate boondoggle were taken up by the rest of the caucus with apparent success. Klobuchar announced Monday that her husband has tested positive for COVID-19 and before that had proposed (with Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden) a national vote-by-mail law intended to prevent the outbreak from interfering with the November election. Even before the current crisis Klobuchar was also known for her interest in making long-term care less costly and burdensome a subject that has relevance to a disease that requires isolating a disproportionately older set of patients.The main reason you wouldn’t put Klobuchar and Warren together under ordinary circumstances is that they are well known for having different opinions on what constitutes a desirable and feasible level of federal spending. But that disagreement is an asset right now. The Democratic Party is having a rare moment of near unanimity about spending because interest rates are at zero percent and the need for a massive disgorgement of public cash is dire. As politicians who’ve spent the past year overtly representing the party’s left and center the pair would send a useful signal—that signal being it is incredibly obvious to a brain-having person what is needed right now—by uniting on a plan and message.One drawback of this idea is that while the Democratic Party is a diverse one along almost all possible axes Klobuchar and Warren have similar demographic profiles: straight white women who are of or near retirement age (Klobuchar is 59). On the other hand older white people are for better or worse the crucial swing demographic in national American politics and white women are the softest spot in the Trump 2016 coalition. It might not be the worst time to pander to them.The goal is not primarily to set up a win in November though. It’s to prevent millions of unnecessary deaths and job losses before then. Democrats need to win the battle of public opinion vis-a-vis Trump’s terrible ideas about for example encouraging people to sit side by side in church on Easter and to create and sell their own better ideas. Klobuchar and Warren who are as ready as anyone for such a surreal assignment could be the left-moderate odd couple that saved America.
276,Trump’s Coronavirus Con,WILLIAM SALETAN,Slate,-2,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/coronavirus-trumps-market-hype-is-a-con.html,Throughout the coronavirus pandemic President Donald Trump has focused on appearance not reality. To make himself look good and maintain confidence in the economy he has fudged the extent of the epidemic oversold evidence of cures exaggerated the availability of tests and downplayed the likelihood of economic disruption. He has also encouraged the public to invest in the stock market even as government officials who knew the extent of the coronavirus threat quietly sold off parts of their portfolios. Trump’s hype about the market isn’t the worst of his deceptions but it’s notable because the market for more than a month moved persistently in the opposite direction from what he kept promising. It shows how willing he is to maintain and prop up a fraudulent story.“Highest Stock Market In History By Far!” the president tweeted on Feb. 19. Two days later after the Dow Jones Industrial Average began to slide Trump told his followers at a rally in Las Vegas “We just hit an all-time high with the stock market.” On Feb. 24 the Dow plunged 1000 points as the virus paralyzed China’s economy and spread to other countries. “The Coronavirus is very much under control” Trump tweeted. “Stock Market starting to look very good to me!” On Feb. 26 as signs of infection increased in the United States the Dow suffered another 1000-point drop. But Trump shrugged that the market “had one bad day; that was yesterday.” The virus he promised would soon “go away.”Trump blamed the sagging Dow on media hysteria. CNN and MSNBC were “doing everything possible to make the Caronavirus look as bad as possible including panicking markets” he tweeted on Feb. 26. “USA in great shape!” Two days later he accused CNN of trying to “stoke a national Coronavirus panic.” The real cause of the market slide he argued was investors’ fear that Trump the savior of the economy might lose to the Democrats. “The market will all come back” he promised. “After I win the election I think the stock market is going to boom like it’s never boomed before.”On March 2 Trump met with pharmaceutical executives for a televised discussion of possible coronavirus therapies and vaccines. The market surged and the president claimed victory. At a rally in North Carolina he thundered “Today we just had the largest one-day increase in the stock market in history!” But the slide resumed and by March 9 thanks to an oil price war and an escalation of virus-related travel warnings the Dow was down another 3000 points.Trump blamed the market’s losses on “the Fake News.” He dismissed the coronavirus as less harmful than the flu for which “nothing is shut down life & the economy go on.” On March 11 the NBA suspended its season. But in a televised address that evening Trump insisted “This is not a financial crisis. This is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome.” The next day he promised that the stock market would “bounce back very big.”As international commercial travel halted Trump argued absurdly that this would help the economy. He took his wrongheaded dogma about trade—that cutting off commerce with other countries is somehow good because that way you keep more for yourself—and applied it to the virus crisis. “I’m not a globalist” he told Sean Hannity on March 4 hours after Italy shut down all its schools. “If people want to spend their money in the United States instead of traveling abroad I’m very fine with that. I think that’s great.” On March 6 Trump exulted “We’re going to have Americans staying home instead of going and spending the money in other countries. And maybe that’s one of the reasons the job numbers are so good.”March 13 a Friday was a good day. That afternoon shortly before the stock market closed Trump held a press conference with corporate executives in the White House Rose Garden. He claimed (falsely) that Google would “very quickly” have a website ready to screen Americans for possible infection and he predicted that the virus would soon “wash through.” The market soared. “BIGGEST STOCK MARKET RISE IN HISTORY” the president tweeted the next day. He declared the press conference a success noting that while he and the executives were doing their pep talk their companies’ share prices had increased. Two days later after another 3000-point plunge he promised “Once this virus is gone I think you’re going to have a stock market like nobody has ever seen before.”Trump never retreated from his bullish message. Each time the market fell he just tweaked the numbers to make the worsening status quo look good.Trump suspected that his March 2 meeting with pharma executives about possible cures had boosted the market that day. So he tried more hype. On March 19 at a press conference and in a call with governors he talked up one of the proposed drugs chloroquine as a “game changer” that had shown “very encouraging early results” and was “going to be great.” Trump’s medical advisers warned that the evidence for chloroquine was purely anecdotal and they cautioned against “false hope.” But Trump stood by his hype—“I’ve been right a lot” he insisted—and he claimed that “stock market geniuses” shared his faith in a full financial recovery. The defeat of the virus “will happen much sooner than originally expected” the president declared on Sunday. “You will see our economy skyrocket. … Everything’s going to fall into place. It’s going to be beautiful.”Trump never retreated from his bullish message. Each time the market fell he just tweaked the numbers to make the worsening status quo look good. On Feb. 26 he noted that the Dow at 28000 was still about 10000 points higher than when he got elected. On March 6 as the sell-off continued he said the market was still “up 70 percent.” On March 12 after another terrible week he argued that it was “still much higher than when I got here.” And on Sunday after all the gains under his presidency were wiped out he bragged that investors hadn’t lost money. The trillions of dollars in wealth that had disappeared were “all cushion” he proudly declared.By Monday the cushion was gone. The Dow fell below 18600 a loss of more than 1000 points since Trump’s inauguration. So he snapped into action. Alarmed by the market’s slide he announced contrary to medical advice that he intended to reopen businesses that had been closed to prevent the spread of the virus. On Tuesday the market responded with a big jump and Trump claimed victory. “The Dow surged over 2100 points. That’s the all-time record” he crowed. Investors “see that we want to get our country open as soon as possible. … That’s a very big factor I think in today’s historic gain.”Trump’s talk of reopening businesses—like his promises about cures websites the production of virus tests and an economy ready to take off “like a rocket”—is about hype not reality. Like any good con man he sells confidence. He might goose the Dow for a day or two. But sooner or later when promises don’t match reality the market goes with reality. For weeks it’s been falling. Rich people knew the truth. Senators knew the truth. The people who don’t are the ones who believe Trump.
277,Republicans Seem to Think They Can Decide Who Dies,DAHLIA LITHWICK,Slate,-2,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/republicans-think-they-can-decide-who-dies.html,Republicans who once decried the Affordable Care Act as a harbinger of “death panels” are now toying with cutting out the middleman and sentencing the country’s oldest to death without bothering with any panels at all. Yes the same Republicans who once soberly asserted things like “there is a provision in [Obamacare] that anyone over the age of 74 has to go before what is effectively a death panel” are now cheerfully suggesting that a few dead elderly people would be a small price to pay to protect the U.S. economy in the coming weeks.The poster boy of such stupidity is currently Dan Patrick Texas’ Republican lieutenant governor who told Tucker Carlson on Monday night that he and America’s other grandparents would be willing to risk their own lives if it meant America getting “back to work” before the pandemic was contained adequately. “Those of us who are 70-plus we’ll take care of ourselves. But don’t sacrifice the country” Patrick intoned heroically. Balking at “stay-at-home” and shelter-in-place directives Patrick insisted that he was willing to personally die so the U.S. economy could thrive for his grandchildren: “No one reached out to me and said ‘As a senior citizen are you willing to take a chance on your survival in exchange for keeping the America that America loves for its children and grandchildren?’ And if that is the exchange I’m all in.” He concluded with possibly the stupidest line of the evening: “As the president said the mortality rate is so low. Do we have to shut down the country?”Patrick is of course wrong about virtually everything in this statement. He seems incapable of understanding that we can’t conclude anything about the virus without widespread testing which remains unavailable. The U.S. numbers we do have certainly indicate that it’s not just the elderly who fall ill and die from the coronavirus—Americans between the ages of 20 and 54 represent almost 40 percent of the people who have been hospitalized in this country. They are taking beds ventilators and other resources away from young people in Porsche accidents just as much as the elderly are. Doctors and nurses working with inadequate protective gear are also becoming infected while treating patients which means that someday Patrick’s capitalism-loving grandchildren won’t have any physicians when they injure themselves counting their stacks of money. And unless Patrick is saying that he and his other 70-year-old human sacrifices all plan to die painfully alone at home they would all still be in hospitals infecting other budding young capitalists on their slow honorable death march to that great big stock exchange in the sky.While it’s easy to lampoon Patrick and others who insist that widespread death and suffering is a small price to pay for the myriad glories of well something-glorious-to-be-named-later it bespeaks a few rather terrifying trends of thought that need to be nipped in the bud stat. The first is the reckless “othering” of people be it Asian Americans or older Americans or immigrants and asylum-seekers. The virus is many things but it won’t discriminate and it shouldn’t be weaponized to license discrimination. It’s true that people older than 70 are more likely to die from this virus and that people older than 80 are terrifyingly likely to die from it. This doesn’t mean we give up on them. Our parents and grandparents aren’t the punchline in some Swiftian joke. They aren’t negotiable; they are people whose unique vulnerability ought to mandate more robust protection not less. This isn’t something we should make deals over. Also eugenics-based arguments about which cohorts of Americans are expendable are doubly suspect from those who have wrapped themselves in the mantle of “life.” (Patrick was recall the guy who famously claimed that abortion causes school shootings.)But the even deeper problem beyond the catastrophic failure to understand epidemiology is the increasingly lethal conviction on the part of at least some Americans that—all medical evidence to the contrary—this is a pandemic that will somehow spare the lucky folk. And that Americans are by definition just too darn lucky to become ill. That was part of the wrongheaded thinking that allowed Donald Trump only a week ago to assure Americans that they needed to “just relax” because “it all will pass.” It’s also part of the wrongheaded thinking that allowed Liberty University to reopen its doors after spring break with president Jerry Falwell Jr. insisting that young people cannot catch or spread the virus: “I think we in a way are protecting the students by having them on campus together” he contends. “Ninety-nine percent of them are not at the age to be at risk and they don’t have conditions that put them at risk.” Maybe Falwell doesn’t understand that his students are all precisely the age to spread the virus and put others at risk. Maybe he can’t be bothered to realize that this will overwhelm small regional hospitals and sicken medical personnel.Perhaps Falwell believes that Liberty students are not merely immune and super-duper lucky but also on some kind of Godly VIP list. That seems to be the view of the Hobby Lobby empire as well which carries with it the added implication that maybe Italians just didn’t pray hard enough about the coronavirus perhaps the most vile suggestion of them all.The problem with Trump and Patrick and Falwell and all those who continue to believe that young Americans or Christian Americans or Americans in red states are somehow not susceptible to the same risks as the rest of us isn’t just that it continues the sordid trend of pitting people against others that has been so politically disastrous for the nation. It also stands as a substitute for actually doing the many many things that need doing right now things that needed doing weeks ago when they could have saved more lives.Donald Trump has staked his whole political reputation on trying to solve immigration problems by blaming immigrants political problems by blaming Democrats science problems by blaming scientists and basic factual problems by blaming journalists. Anyone who rejected such framing was disloyal and un-American and accused of “tearing us apart.” But a pandemic that can be at least blunted by action will not be touched by carving up the nation into the godly and the godless the young and the old Republican and Democrat workers and those whom the economy can stand to put out to pasture. Any solution that depends on working those fault lines will not just fail to stem the oncoming crisis. It will also handily create new classes of unnecessary victims.
278,Trump Toys With Turning the Coronavirus Loose Again,JEREMY STAHL,Slate,-2,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/trump-plan-opening-coronavirus-easter.html,Watching Donald Trump’s press appearances Monday and Tuesday has been like watching a movie where a serial killer taunts the police with clever riddles about his next probable victim and they are helpless to stop him—if the killer’s message were “I’m going to stab Tom on Wednesday at the park at lunchtime” and also the killer ran the police force.In this case Trump is proudly broadcasting various plans that health care experts warn would lead to tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of needless deaths if enacted. His latest notion first announced during a coronavirus task force press conference on Monday and then elaborated upon during a Fox News town hall event on Tuesday is to “open” the economy by ending mass public lockdowns even as the tide of coronavirus cases is forecast to soon overwhelm our hospital systems and possibly cause the sort of medical shortages and unrelenting mass death seen in Italy.The president went on to explain that he felt that “the Dow was helped by the fact that” he was talking about “opening relatively soon.”The stock market had rallied before Trump’s press event on Tuesday on news that Senate negotiators were close to a deal to pump about $2 trillion in stimulus into the badly damaged economy. But Trump attributed the spike to his talk of “opening” the economy.“I think that [legislation] maybe had even less of an impact than the fact that we’re opening up this incredible country because we have to do that” he said. (The Dow actually dropped a bit during the president’s hourlong Fox News appearance after having risen for much of the rest of the day.)Trump also speculated that the coronavirus would be less deadly than experts have described.“When you add all of the people the millions of people that have it that get better we’re substantially under 1 percent” he guessed of the mortality rate for the coronavirus.“When they came to my office don’t forget they were saying 3 percent 4 percent 5 percent there’s a very big difference” he said of the medical advice he had received and was now ignoring. “No we have to put our country back to work.”Because testing shortages have made it impossible to check the entire population of infected people for the virus it’s unclear what the actual death rate is for COVID-19. The rate of mortality in confirmed cases though has been as high as 9.5 percent in Italy and 4.3 percent in France. Part of what appears to be leading to these death rates is the disease spreading much more quickly than the hospital systems can keep up due to a combination of lax policing of social distancing and shortages of medical supplies.Part of Trump’s proposal appears to be to end social distancing and send people back to work in large numbers which would make new infections multiply. That plan is rejected not only by public health professionals but also notably by otherwise stalwartly Trump-supporting Republicans such as Sen. Tom Cotton Rep. Liz Cheney Sen. Lindsey Graham and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine. In the words of DeWine “When people are dying and people don’t feel safe the economy is not going to come back.” With front-line governors like DeWine having to make the decision that would “open” the economies in their given states it fortunately seems unlikely that most states will go along with Trump’s plan at the expense of the lives of their states’ citizens.What about the second part of the coronavirus puzzle though—the medical supply shortages? The other thing Trump did on Tuesday was pick a fight with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo after Cuomo had all but begged the federal government for help acquiring badly needed ventilators for the epicenter of the American outbreak.Cuomo said during his press conference on Tuesday that his state’s cases were doubling every three days and that at this rate of growth caseloads would peak in two to three weeks. He said his state has procured about 7000 ventilators—the equipment that will soon be needed to keep coronavirus patients from dying en masse—and that it currently has a shortfall of about 30000 from its anticipated need.“There is no other way for us to get these ventilators. We’ve tried everything else. The only way that we can obtain these ventilators is from the federal government. Period” Cuomo said exhorting Trump to order factories to start building the equipment through the Defense Production Act. “Only the federal government has that power. And not to exercise that power is inexplicable to me” he added. “I do not for the life of me understand the reluctance to use the federal Defense Production Act.”But after being lobbied by the Chamber of Commerce and other corporate interests in recent days Trump has steadfastly refused to place ventilator orders using the DPA.Cuomo also called on the federal government to release its strategic stockpile of ventilators to New York. “How can we be in a situation where you have New Yorkers possibly dying because you can’t get a ventilator but a federal agency saying ‘I’m going to leave the ventilators in the stockpile.’ I mean have we really come to that point?” Cuomo said.Prior to Trump speaking Vice President Mike Pence said that the federal government would be sending New York 2000 ventilators from its strategic supply of 20000 on Tuesday and 2000 more on Monday but it’s unclear whether those were included in the 7000 Cuomo said his state has been able to procure and it is well short of the 30000 he says the state needs in the next two weeks.Trump who is the only person in the country right now who can order that this lifesaving equipment be manufactured near the scale needed addressed Cuomo’s exhortations during his Fox News appearance by taunting the governor suggesting aid for New York state was a personal favor Trump was doing for Cuomo and citing an article from a conspiracy theory–peddling website that blamed Cuomo for failing to build a greater strategic stockpile for the state five years ago. Here’s what the president said:I watched Gov. Cuomo and he was very nice. We’re building him hospitals we’re building him medical centers and he was complaining about—we’re doing probably more for him definitely more for him than anybody else and he was talking about the ventilators but he should have ordered the ventilators. And he had a choice he had a chance because right here I just got this out that he refused to order 15000 ventilators I’ll show this to Bill [Hemmer] take a look at that Bill. This says “New York Governor Andrew Cuomo rejected buying 16000 ventilators in 2015 for the pandemic for a pandemic established death panels and a lottery instead.” So he had a chance to buy in 2016 16000 ventilators at a very low price and he turned it down. I’m not blaming him or anything else. But he shouldn’t be talking about us. He’s supposed to be buying his own ventilators. We’re going to help but if you think about Gov. Cuomo we’re building him four hospitals we’re building him four medical centers we’re working very very hard for the people of New York we’re working along with him and then I watched him on the show complaining. And he had 16000 ventilators that he could have had for a great price and he didn’t buy them.Trump continued his remarks around Cuomo later in the event:But you know it’s a two-way street. They have to treat us well also. They can’t say “Oh gee we should get this. We should get that.” We’re doing a great job like in New York where we’re building as I said four hospitals. We’re literally building hospitals and medical centers. And then I hear that there’s a problem with ventilators. Well we sent them ventilators and they could have had [15000] or 16000. All they had to do is order them two years ago but they decided not to do it. They can’t blame us for that.So Trump’s current plan to protect the nation from the coronavirus pandemic involves: (1) “opening” the economy against the advice of medical professionals political allies and many of the nation’s governors in a way that would cause the disease to spread and cases to explode and hospitals to be overwhelmed; (2) blaming equipment shortages on the governors after refusing to take the actions necessary to make up the shortfalls. And in all of this his top priority remains the only thing it’s ever been—insisting in the midst of an economic and public health disaster that “they have to treat us well.” What’s a little more American carnage next to the need to protect the presidential ego?
279,Can the 2020 Election Survive the Pandemic?,MARY HARRIS,Slate,-2,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/coronavirus-covid19-2020-election.html,Nate Persily is a professor of law at Stanford University who works in voting rights and campaign finance. He’s familiar with the myriad flaws in our electoral system and he’s often appointed by courts to resolve local redistricting controversies. Right now he’s concerned about a force that may completely break the 2020 presidential election: the COVID-19 pandemic. Persily warns that our elections process as it stands is not ready for the public health risks and disruptions to come from the coronavirus. There are steps we can take to ensure a safe and fair election but we need to start taking them now.I spoke to Persily on Tuesday’s episode of What Next about how the coronavirus stands to affect our voting processes and what needs to change come November. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.Mary Harris: Last week Ohio delayed its primaries due to health concerns. Can you describe what happened for people who may not have followed it closely?Nate Persily: It was a sort of complicated legal drama involving the governor the secretary of state the state’s highest public health officials judges and the state Supreme Court. There was a dispute between different factions as to whether the election was going to go forward. Ultimately the health director said: Look I’m banning any gatherings of over 50 people. That includes elections. The state has delayed the election by over a month and a half and now it’s collecting absentee ballots and trying to figure out what to do when the election does run.We diffuse power throughout our system when it comes to administering elections. It’s a problem generally that we don’t have say a national election authority in the United States. Instead we have over 8000 jurisdictions running our elections. So at the state level there’s a question as to who’s in charge. And we’ve never had a situation where a state’s health director ends up being in charge of an election where they say you may not vote because it could be dangerous to your health.Is this going to be what happens in November each state choosing on its own how it wants to proceed?The general election has certain rules that primaries don’t. One of the most important rules is a federal statute that mandates what time and what day the election will take place. It’s not something for example the president could change on his own. But it is still the case that the states have great power to decide how elections are going to be conducted whether they will be conducted by mail and how early voting will take place. There is a risk that when it comes to the extreme measures that need to be taken to confront the pandemic you’re going to get high variation between different states.It seems like in this new landscape running elections like business as usual is not going to work. Having so many people show up in person is too dangerous not just for voters but for polling workers who tend to be older and might not want to show up. That means some polling places may have to close down and voters will be chaotically shuffled to new locations.Not only that but it affects where you may locate these polling places. A substantial share of polling places are located in senior facilities places like nursing homes. This might not be an election where you would like 700000 people in a single day going through some of these facilities. The same is true with schools.So this causes a crisis—for poll workers finding enough people to man the polls as well as locations suitable for voting under these conditions and then for voter turnout generally.You published these 10 recommendations to ensure a healthy and trustworthy election. When I read it it felt to me like it was like one recommendation which is that we all need to be thinking about voting by mail. Why does that seem like the right solution to you?We have to move more voters to mail because we’re not going to have the number of polling places needed for all of them. If we have mail balloting we don’t have to worry about poll worker health scared voters or polling place consolidation. Vote by mail is something that we have done successfully in the U.S.: Places like Washington Oregon and Colorado basically cast all of their votes by mail. But states like Wisconsin and New Hampshire have only had roughly 5 percent of their votes cast by mail because they’ve required excuses for absentee ballots. Overall the election administration regime is not prepared for this level of mail voting.Moving to vote by mail on the regular seems like it would be challenging in normal circumstances. How long would this take if there were no coronavirus?“Something we need to be prepared for is the possibility that we will not know a winner on election night.”— Nate PersilyYou have to start preparing roughly six months in advance. That means we have about a month right now to make the critical decisions on whether a state or jurisdiction is going to move to vote by mail. They cannot just flick a switch and say they’re going to mail ballots to everyone. It’s a lot more complicated than that partly because of how decentralized our electoral system is partly because of the number of ballots these jurisdictions are dealing with and partly because of the equipment that’s needed like certain types of scanners to count mailed ballots.The first question is are people registered to vote by mail? Assuming that you have everyone who’s going to be voting by mail you have to have a reliable database of addresses to get them their ballots. And there are large swaths of people who do not live in reliable addresses. Because of the dislocation caused by the virus you’re going to have people living and staying in different locations than they otherwise would be.The signatures on absentee ballots also become an important part of verification. Once a ballot is received by a jurisdiction administrators look at the signature they have on file and verify whether that signature matches the ballot’s. A lot of people also don’t have familiar signatures so not all of them are going to match. And if you try to verify all these signatures that don’t match what you have on the rolls it could take several days to report election results. That’s something we really do need to be prepared for: the possibility that we will not know a winner on election night.I want to talk about who might be left behind with a big voting switch. In Georgia it’s been found that minorities are more often flagged as having signatures that don’t match. Plus people are moving: Young people are moving back in with their parents and older people are moving in with their adult children. And then there are people who have always faced a struggle to vote like Native American populations who may not have a street address or may have a P.O. Box. Does this trouble you at all?It does. There are all kinds of biases that one sees in shifts between different ways of voting. In states that offer vote by mail as an option it’s predominantly whiter and older folks who are willing to do so. You see a racial bias in the data on who chooses to vote by mail and a lot of this has to do with people’s lack of trust in the mail service to deliver the ballot. So one thing that is critical for this election is making sure that voters whatever their race or party affiliation believe there’s an equal likelihood their ballots are going to be counted.What would it take to get this done? We have Congress considering this massive stimulus right now and I know it’s considering support for this vote-by-mail measure.It will cost between $2 billion and $3 billion to roll out a robust vote-by-mail program for the fall. It requires equipment and it requires more poll workers.But vote by mail isn’t the only solution. There are going to be millions maybe tens of millions of people who are not going to want to vote by mail. So we also need to construct polling places in such a way that people feel safe when they go to vote.What would that look like? That requires maintaining social distancing in polling places. You could have people voting from their car or voting from the street. You could also make sure that polling places are in very large facilities where there’s enough distance between ballot machines that no one will be too close to one another. You’re going to have poll workers with masks on making sure they don’t end up being infected by the swath of voters coming toward them. And they need to make sure there aren’t long congregated lines on Election Day—that people are spaced out so they’re not within 6 feet of each other.The problem is if you want to deal with this problem in November you have to start dealing with it in June. Plus it may well be that the contagion recedes over the summer but comes back with a vengeance just around Election Day. So the worst-case scenario is that people and election authorities don’t take proper precautions and then we are stuck with an election that can’t be run because of the rising contagion.The basics of trying to get jurisdictions on the same page as to how to manage this election are difficult enough. But if we dedicate the effort and the resources we can do it. It’s not as if we’re trying to invent a new technology here or perfect the voting machine. There are states that are going to run this election without problems and we need to try to take best practices from those states and bring them to states that are not doing it. But that requires federal resources. We’ll need billions of dollars to pull this off and that should be part of any stimulus package that Congress passes.
280,Governors Beg for Medical Supplies as Trump Refuses to Act,JEREMY STAHL,Slate,-2,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/cuomo-governors-beg-medical-supplies-trump-refuses.html,On Monday New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo delivered his daily coronavirus press conference and issued what has now become a standard entreaty: pleading for the federal government to help supply the states with necessary medical equipment by utilizing the Defense Production Act to order businesses to start ramping up production of critical supplies.Democratic leaders and officials from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders to former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have all pleaded with the Trump administration to begin using the act to supply states and cities with badly needed masks ventilators and other critical equipment as inventory is being used up by an influx of COVID-19 patients that is only growing by the day.Cuomo’s request on Monday offered a clear and cogent explanation for why it is necessary for President Donald Trump to invoke the Korean War–era act which allows him to order production of vital goods during national emergencies. In the absence of federal command and coordination states have been pitted against one another in bidding wars for the medical products of a limited number of suppliers. As Cuomo said:This is ad hoc. I’m competing with other states. I’m bidding up other states on the prices. Because you have manufacturers who sit there and California offers them four dollars and they say ‘well California offered four dollars.’ I offer five dollars another state calls in and offers six dollars. It’s not the way to do it. I was speaking to Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker yesterday about this. Why are we competing? Let the federal government put in place the federal Defense Production Act. It does not nationalize any industry. All it does is say to a factory you must produce this quantity. That’s all it does. …The federal Defense Production Act just says you can tell a company ‘Manufacture this many by this date.’ Yes it is an assertion of government power on private sector companies. Yes. But: so what. This is a national emergency. And you’re paying the private sector company. They’re going to produce a good and they’re going to get paid. And by the way they’re going to get paid handsomely. You cannot continue to do these supplies on an ad hoc basis.Trump who would have to personally order the DPA to go into effect sent his own message to Pritzker and other desperate governors on Sunday in response to those DPA requests.Donald J. Trump✔@realDonaldTrump.@JBPritzker Governor of Illinois and a very small group of certain other Governors together with Fake News @CNN & Concast (MSDNC) shouldn’t be blaming the Federal Government for their own shortcomings. We are there to back you up should you fail and always will be!121K12:14 PM - Mar 22 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy71.4K people are talking about thisTrump’s refusal to take on the obligation to solve the medical-supply crisis is in line with his personal history and entire response to the current pandemic including his statement earlier this month that “I don’t take responsibility at all” for the administration’s early testing failures that helped the disease spread unchecked around the country.Yet Trump—through his DPA powers—is currently the only person who can take on the responsibility for bolstering an about-to-collapse health care system to protect untold numbers of lives of people in this country.What is he waiting for exactly?The response to Pritzker suggests he’s waiting for states to “fail”—that is for widespread shortages of ventilators to lead to rationing that leads to mass death as has already happened in Italy—before swooping in to play the hero and “back you up.”But that was only the latest in a series of evasion lies and changing positions Trump has offered around the question of using his DPA powers. On Wednesday he said he was invoking the DPA but did not do anything to put it into action. Afterward he said he would only actually utilize it “in a worst case scenario.”By Friday after facing a series of questions during the daily coronavirus task force press conference about why he hadn’t issued DPA orders as the conditions in New York have headed toward a “worst case scenario” Trump suggested that he was already taking DPA action: “When we need something because of the Act when we need something we order something” he told reporters.A reporter then asked the president if had “actually directed any companies to start making ventilators or masks.”“I have” Trump said. “I have. Yes.”The reporter then asked the obvious follow-up question—given there had been no announcement about any DPA orders whatsoever—“How many?”“A lot” Trump said. “A lot. And they’re making a lot of ventilators and they’re making a lot of masks.”By his press conference on Sunday Trump all but admitted that this was a lie conceding that he hadn’t used the act to direct companies to make emergency products and saying that some production had begun “on a purely voluntary basis.” Trump explained that he was ideologically opposed to using the DPA because it was socialism which doesn’t work.“We’re a country not based on nationalizing our business” Trump said. “Call a person over in Venezuela ask them how did nationalization of their businesses work out. Not too well. The concept of nationalizing our businesses is not a good concept.”On Monday the New York Times reported another apparent reason Trump has refused to utilize the DPA: corporate lobbying. As the Times reported “The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the heads of major corporations have lobbied the administration against using the act. They say the move could prove counterproductive imposing red tape on companies precisely when they need flexibility to deal with closed borders and shuttered factories.”CNN’s John Harwood reported on Monday that the Chamber opposed the used of the DPA because “no one can tell us what problem they are solving by invoking the DPA” and companies might be forced to “turn their attention to dealing with the legal questions and following the DPA.”As the Times reported the direct issue that would be handled by using the DPA would be the prevention of widespread shortages as industry executives have refused or are unable to act on their own in sufficient numbers and coordination:Industry executives say companies are reluctant to crank up production lines without purchasing guarantees from the government. With the economy in free-fall and factories shuttering around the country few manufacturers are eager to invest in new machinery or venture into new products.The failure of leadership the Times noted is causing mass confusion among the industries that again could be helping to lessen an even greater looming crisis:In interviews with participants in the process from business executives to government officials there is still widespread confusion about how much and what exactly each firm is supposed to produce. Corporate executives say they face a bewildering number of requests from dozens of nations around the world along with governors and mayors around the country for scarce supplies. The White House has not said who will set the priority list for deliveries. And it is not clear that any of it will arrive in time for the cities and the states that are hit the hardest including New York.Carla Bailo the president of the Center for Automotive Research told the Times that auto companies such as General Motors and Ford—that have shuttered their own car manufacturing operations as part of efforts to protect workers from the spread of the disease—could actually ramp up ventilator production “in as little as three to six weeks” if asked.The deadly shortages will likely hit sooner than that which is why every day Trump does not utilize the act will likely be another day of health care rationing that will lead directly to large numbers of deaths. The number of confirmed cases in New York alone has exploded to more than 20000 with 125 having already died and Cuomo warned that his hospitals will likely need an additional 15000 to 34000 ventilator-equipped intensive care unit beds in the days ahead.Again in his press conference on Sunday Trump rejected the premise when he was confronted with the reality of shortages and rationing laying the responsibility—and blame—for the situation with others who don’t actually have the power to do anything about it.“We’re really backing up the governors. The governors have to go out and do their things. And you have a lot of governors they’ve done a fantastic job. You have some that haven’t” Trump said. “Usually it’s the ones that complain that have the problems. But we’ve had a great relationship as an example with Gov. Cuomo.”As Cuomo emphasized on Monday he was on the list of governors that were expecting widespread shortages as soon as next week unless Trump acts.“Today we can get masks to anyone who needs them and gowns” he told reporters about his state’s current stock of supplies. “I can’t promise you next week or the week thereafter and that’s why I want to see the federal government do this federal Defense Production Act and stop this ad hoc volunteerism.”
281,Calls Grow for Sen. Burr to Resign After He Sold $1.7 Million in Stocks & Downplayed COVID-19 Risks,,Democracy Now,-2,https://www.democracynow.org/2020/3/25/senator_richard_burr_stocks_coronavirus,Calls are growing for Republican Senator Richard Burr to resign after he reportedly sold up to $1.7 million worth of stocks after receiving privileged briefings about the coronavirus’s threat to the global economy. ProPublica reports Burr the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee unloaded his holdings on February 13 in 33 separate transactions. At the time he had access to classified information about the coronavirus and was receiving daily intelligence briefings. The stock market began plummeting a week after Burr’s sales and has since lost about 30% of its value. We speak with Derek Willis of ProPublica one of the reporters who broke the story.TranscriptThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! democracynow.org The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman with Juan González. Calls are growing for Republican Senator Richard Burr to resign after he reportedly sold up to $1.7 million worth of stock after receiving privileged briefings about the coronavirus threat to the global community months ago. ProPublica reports Burr the chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee unloaded his holdings on February 13th in 33 separate transactions. At the time he had access to classified information about the coronavirus and was receiving daily intelligence briefings. The stock market began plummeting a week later.The news came after NPR published a secretly recorded audiotape of Senator Burr addressing business leaders and members of the elite Tar Heel Circle at a luncheon in Washington on February 27th when the U.S. had just 15 confirmed coronavirus cases.SEN. RICHARD BURR: It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history. It’s probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic.AMY GOODMAN: Senator Burr said quote “It is much more aggressive in its transmission than anything that we have seen in recent history. It’s probably more akin to the 1918 pandemic.” Burr’s actions sparked condemnation across the political spectrum from Democratic Congressmember Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York to Fox News host Tucker Carlson.Well for more we’re joined by one of the reporters who broke this story Derek Willis of ProPublica.Welcome to Democracy Now! Derek again joining us on Democracy Now! video stream from his home as so many of our guests are to protect themselves and the community from COVID-19. Juan with us from his home in New Brunswick New Jersey. Derek talk about what you found. And it’s not only Senator Burr but talk about what he did.DEREK WILLIS: Sure. Well Senator Burr as you said traded made 33 separate sales transactions on February 13th of stock holdings. Now because of the way that these stock trades are reported we don’t know the exact amounts. We have a range of amounts. And so the amounts here they range in total between $628000 to up to $1.7 million of value. And the thing about this is Senator Burr is not the only senator or member of Congress to trade in stocks. He’s not the only person to sell stocks this year. But the volume of his trades and the timing of it and in addition to what NPR reported about his public and private comments they really set him apart compared to a lot of his colleagues in terms of sort of the uniqueness of his situation. As the chair of the Intelligence Committee Senator Burr was getting as you said classified briefings about threats to the nation including from coronavirus in the weeks before he made these trades.JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And Derek I wanted to ask you specifically about that. Were there particular hearings that he was privy to just before these trades occurred?DEREK WILLIS: We don’t know exactly what was said in these briefings. There was a Senate-wide briefing late in January about coronavirus and what it could mean that was available to all senators. Senator Burr did attend that briefing. Not every senator did. But that wasn’t a classified briefing in the same way that Intelligence Committee briefings are. And so the part of this that we don’t know is we don’t know what he learned in some of those classified briefings. He has said that his trades were based on public information what he simply saw on CNBC or other networks that talked about sort of the financial aspects of — the financial impacts of coronavirus.AMY GOODMAN: And can you talk about the other senators? You did say you know people do sell whether or not they have privileged information but Republicans James Inhofe of Oklahoma; Kelly Loeffler the new senator from Georgia; Ron Johnson of Wisconsin — Loeffler married to the chair and CEO of the New York Stock Exchange.DEREK WILLIS: That’s right. And I think like I said I want to make clear that like Senator Burr’s were sort of in a class by themselves. But with Senator Loeffler obviously sort of one of the interesting aspects there is the fact her connection to the New York Stock Exchange and through her husband. Her investments I think are different in some respects in that they are — they appear to be at least from everything that we know and what she has said — they are traded by someone else and she is informed of the trade after the fact. That’s actually not uncommon for members of Congress particularly those with significant wealth to have sort of a third party do the trades for them. Of course you know we’re relying on their say-so.AMY GOODMAN: Derek we only have a minute but Burr has called for an ethics investigation to exonerate him. But also if you can say — I mean so he had this information. I guess the question is also: What was he telling his constituents or the entire country at the time that President Trump was hardly taking action at this point certainly when it came to tests and availability of protective gear etc.?DEREK WILLIS: Right. The message he was putting out was essentially that the United States is in a good position to act against or to mitigate the effects of this virus while at the same time he was selling these stocks.AMY GOODMAN: Well we want to thank you so much Derek Willis reporter from ProPublica. Just to end with The Wall Street Journal reporting Tuesday corporate executives sold over $9 billion worth of stocks between the beginning of February and the end of last week. Jeff Bezos sold the most of the executives 3% of his Amazon shares worth $3.4 billion.And that does it for our show.

282,U.S. Is #1 in Pandemic: Rep. Omar Blasts Trump for “Wrong Kind of American Exceptionalism”,,Democracy Now,-2,https://www.democracynow.org/2020/3/27/rep_ilhan_omar_coronavirus_relief_bill,As much of the United States is under lockdown the House votes today on a $2 trillion emergency relief package to address the economic crisis caused by the pandemic. It will generate payments to most Americans and includes protections for workers but it is also a massive bailout for a number of industries and corporations and the vote comes as a record 3.28 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits. We speak with Congressmember Ilhan Omar of Minnesota the first Somali American elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and one of the first Muslim women in Congress about the bill Trump’s response to the pandemic how she has joined calls for student debt relief and to release immigrants and prisoners facing infection and the challenges African countries face in responding to the coronavirus.TranscriptThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.AMY GOODMAN: We’re broadcasting from the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States. We’re broadcasting from New York City. The United States is now number one in the world for coronavirus infections overtaking China and Italy. The number of cases in the U.S. has surged to 85000 people. The number is far higher because of the lack of testing. As President Trump continues to defy his scientific advisers and downplay the threat of the highly contagious disease at least 1300 people have died across the U.S. and the global death toll is more than 24000. As much of the United States and the world is under lockdown the House of Representatives is voting today on a $2 trillion emergency relief package to address the economic crisis caused by the pandemic. The bill will generate payments to most Americans and includes protections for workers but it’s also a massive bailout for a number of corporations and industries. The vote comes as a record-shattering nearly 3.3 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week amidst the coronavirus crisis. This is optician Ali Nelson who was laid off amidst the pandemic.ALI NELSON: We stayed open as long as we could until it just got to be too much and our boss just pretty much said you know “We’re going to have to shut down until further notice.” And so that’s kind of where we’re at right now. So not fortunately it’s a small company so we’re not getting paid. And I’m the primary wage earner in my home. And so you know I went ahead and filed for unemployment.AMY GOODMAN: For more we go to Washington D.C. where we’re joined by Congressmember Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. She’s the first Somali American elected to the U.S. House of Representatives one of the first Muslim women in Congress along with Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and she’s the only refugee a refugee from Africa.Welcome back to Democracy Now! Congressmember Omar. Can you talk today about what you are voting on? Can you talk about this massive the largest bill relief bill in the history of United States? What concerns you most? Why are you supporting it?REP. ILHAN OMAR: Thank you Amy for having me. I was just listening to you go through the story and being the epicenter of this pandemic truly is the wrong kind of American exceptionalism. We would like to be on top of every list. This is the one list we should never really aspire to be on. And I think this crisis and this pandemic really lays bare the kind of inequalities that have existed for far too long in our country. And the conversations we’re having right now as we put forth our third relief package shows us that there is often a prioritization of corporate interests and often not a prioritization of the interests of the people.So today I plan on voting for this bill not because it’s perfect or it’s sufficient but because I think in a time where we are facing one of the largest crises we’ve faced in our country it’s going to be really important for us to do everything that we can to protect the lives and the livelihoods of the people of this country. My home state just in 10 days there has been 165000 people who filed for unemployment insurance. And nationwide as you said it’s 3.3 million. And so we have to make sure that we are doing everything that we can to deliver relief.So a few of the things that are in this package really align with the progressive vision that we’ve had and some of the bills that I’ve introduced as we’ve gone through this crisis. One is that it will offer cash relief. It’s not the kind of universal or monthly cash relief that I had championed but it will be helpful to a lot of people. We are also seeing exceptional expansion of unemployment insurance. As you know that’s thanks to Senator Bernie Sanders who made sure that we had that in there. For the first time we saw Republicans get bent out of shape because Americans who are poor might be able to get a few extra dollars even though they are going to be the most in need during this crisis. We’re also seeing an expansion of the unemployment insurance where it will cover people who are new — who have had a new entrance into the job market people who are self-employed people who are self-isolating or are forced to isolate. And so it is going to be a helpful package in that regard.We’re going to see real relief for small businesses. In my district in the Minnesota 5th we’re seeing a real squeeze and pain being felt by small businesses. And so I introduced the ABLE Act and I believe this package currently allows for the vision that I had to be actualized.We also heard so much from our local municipalities big cities small cities. I represent Minneapolis and 15 suburban cities and so we know that many of them need the relief that comes — that’s coming in this package toward states and local municipalities. There are many governors and mayors around the country like our governor Walz who are showing exceptional leadership who are not downplaying this pandemic who are doing everything that they can to protect the public provide relief. Minnesota is one of the few states that has put a moratorium on eviction. They’re working really hard to try to make sure that there is support for people. We also have a sort of a lockdown in place that helps curb the spread of this virus — visions that we have for the country that are being carried out by the leadership in Minnesota.AMY GOODMAN: So Congressmember Omar let me ask you. The bill includes a $1200 one-time payment to most Americans with $500 in addition for kids. You have called for getting cash in people’s hands; it should be universal and monthly. How are people going to get this money even those that get this one-shot deal people in the gig economy? How is it delivered to them?REP. ILHAN OMAR: Yeah that really is the one piece that this bill is very divergent from the vision that I had and many others had. We expected that it would go through the IRS and Social Security to make sure everyone would be able to get the money that they need. And now we’re hearing that this process is going to go through the IRS for people who have filed taxes before and people who have accounts and had direct deposits. And so it’s going to be a very messy process and completely disheartening because we know Americans need this relief today. And so any administrative delay is going to exasperate the kind of economic anxiety and pain many of our community members are feeling.AMY GOODMAN: Tour fellow congressmember Rashida Tlaib has called for the government to give out debit cards that people can have access to money right away.REP. ILHAN OMAR: Right because what you want is you want to make sure that you’re making it as accessible as possible and that you are not spending money on administrative costs. And so when we make this process means-tested when we make it a process that goes through so many hoops we know it’s not going to get into the hands of the people that need it the most when they need it the most. And so that’s the piece in this legislation that’s really devastating because we know that the corporations that are getting the bailout are not going to have difficulties in extracting the money that they’re being promised but the people will. And that really is when you get to see how unjust our systems can be and how cruel it is to be poor and disconnected and resourceless in this country.AMY GOODMAN: You and Congressmember Ayanna Pressley have introduced legislation to cancel student debt as part of the COVID-19 emergency stimulus package. Was that included in the bill? Explain.REP. ILHAN OMAR: So what we were calling for was a $30000 cancellation of student debt. The bill currently does not have that. It has about $10000. Again it is not as clean as it would have been with Ayanna and I’s bill and it again will have a huge process. The one thing that I am exceptionally excited about it’s the fact that there is a deferment for student debt so that people can get relief for a few months in regards to that.AMY GOODMAN: What about undocumented immigrants the millions of millions and millions of people who are afraid to come forward perhaps even to get tested which is not only protection for them but for the whole community? When President Trump was asked about this whether they would be gone after if they went to a hospital or if they got a test he said “No they can certainly do that. It’s important” he suggested “before they’re deported to another country.” Your response?REP. ILHAN OMAR: So we know that there are many people who are still being subjected to ICE raids who are being put in ICE detention. Just a few weeks ago Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York one of my sisters in service was at an airport due to a tip where she stopped young children that were being trafficked by an ICE agent transported from one state to another. And it is really inhumane to see us continue in this process. ICE detention centers are overly crowded. So we’ve called for a halt in deportation. We’ve called for a halt in all immigration court proceedings because we know that that could be a hot spot for the spread of the virus. We’ve called for a stop in having ICE come into our communities and terrorize people.We want people to feel comfortable enough to seek medical attention when they need it. The reason sanctuary cities exist is because it allows those that are most vulnerable in our communities to be able to access the services that they need. When you have vulnerable communities hiding not seeking the service that they need you put all of us at risk. And so we want people to lead with humanity. We want for there to be a just society. And so when we’re asking for clemency for those that are ill that are elderly in our jails and prisons we’re asking for people to be saved who need to be saved. And so it is really devastating to know that the “party of life” really devalues human life regards to class or ethnicity or gender. And that I think is the center of the conversation we’re having.AMY GOODMAN: Congressmember Omar we had on the former director of ICE John Sandweg who is calling for ICE which has the ultimate authority in this particular case to release thousands of detainees. How is this being addressed right now?REP. ILHAN OMAR: It’s not. We’ve put out a letter. My office led a letter to the administration to the Department of Homeland Security asking them to do precisely what the former director is calling for. We know that there are so many people who are caught up in this unjust immigration system. Not everybody is the violent murderer that the Republicans talk about. There are so many people who have a right to seek asylum who have a right to come and look for opportunities to start anew. And we need to give them that opportunity and we need to protect their life at the moment. And again like I said it’s really quite astonishing to see that the “party of life” does not advocate for all human life to be uplifted.AMY GOODMAN: Congressmember Omar you have been very critical of the $500 billion what some people are calling a corporate slush fund that it has very little oversight though it was strengthened somewhat in this latest bill. Others said “Why wasn’t it just sliced out of the $2 trillion package?” That you have the president saying he’ll be the oversight on what corporations are bailed out. How do you feel that there are some now protections and safeguards in this bill that you’re voting on today about who gets this?REP. ILHAN OMAR: Well first of all nobody trusts Trump and his administration to have oversight over anything let alone this kind of corporate welfare. And we know in previous bailouts money has been misused and it took years to be able to regulate it and make sure that it was going into the hands of the right people. And so there are some protections in place and I look forward to what the follow-ups are going to be as we strengthen the kind of check and balances that we want to put in place. This is when it’s going to be really important for Congress to exercise their oversight powers to make sure that this independent agency that we’re going to put in place has the right people at the table to be able to make sure that they are protecting American tax dollars.AMY GOODMAN: Congressmember Omar you are the first African refugee to be elected to Congress. You are from Somalia. Africa has been called a ticking time bomb in the coronavirus pandemic. What needs to happen there? What are your deepest concerns there?REP. ILHAN OMAR: Yeah I mean it’s really a privilege when we talk about social distancing right? I recently read an article that was shared by my sister who’s currently living in Africa. And she said you know in Africa social distancing is just not possible. And so we know that they don’t have the privileges in many spots in Africa where they can go and get a week’s worth of groceries and have it be refrigerated. Many of Africa doesn’t have the broadband capacity or internet capacity electricity capacity to be able to work from home for a mass population. And so my hope is that the efforts that are being put in place by some of the leaders there really do work the people try to take as many precautions as they can and that we don’t stop thinking about those that are in countries that are not as fortunate as ours. If we are struggling this much as one of the wealthiest countries in the world in providing urgent and proper healthcare to people who need it in providing financial relief to people who need it in stabilizing our economy in delivering much-needed services to our most vulnerable can you imagine what countries that are heavily populated but don’t have any of those resources may be dealing with?AMY GOODMAN: Congressmember we have to go but I wanted to ask your overall assessment of how President Trump has handled this from the egregious lack of tests that are available in this country that go to the core of public health strategies to find hot spots to know how to deal with people to the issue of protective gear being available to the bravest in this country the doctors the nurses the people who are doing sanitation in hospitals being protected. Can you assess what President Trump has done?REP. ILHAN OMAR: Yeah. In the experts we trust. In Donald Trump we don’t. It is really devastating to watch how much he is downplaying this crisis how much he’s driven really by his poll numbers and what is going to happen in the upcoming election. This is the time for bold leadership. This is the time to make sure that you are protecting every single American. When we think about war one of the first things that happens is that you are told to leave no one behind. And so we want this president this administration to stop fooling around to stop downplaying this crisis to really take this pandemic serious to protect —AMY GOODMAN: And President Trump saying he’s going to try to open the country up by —REP. ILHAN OMAR: — the American people to put in place proper policies.AMY GOODMAN: President Trump saying he’ll try to open the country up by Easter when the doctors and the —REP. ILHAN OMAR: That is — that is extremely irresponsible and dangerous. We want to make sure that people are being protected. Lives are much more important than this economy regardless of what the president or some of Republican talking heads might say. It is really quite devastating to see people have a conversation about what it looks like to prioritize anything other than preserving the lives and the livelihoods of the people we were elected to preserve. And so I ask vigorously of every single American to have a conversation about the lack of leadership that is being shown and the kind of danger that we are being put in by a president who certainly doesn’t know how to trust scientists who some have even asked if he knows what a ventilator is and someone who clearly doesn’t have a clue what it means to put country first.AMY GOODMAN: Congressmember Ilhan Omar I want to thank you for being with us representing the 5th Congressional District in Minnesota one of two Muslim women now the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress and the first African refugee to serve there.When we come back we speak with author Matt Stoller who says “The coronavirus relief bill could turn into a corporate coup if we aren’t careful.” Stay with us.
283,“Total System Failure”: Congress Pushes $2 Trillion Pandemic Bill. Will Dems Allow “Corporate Coup”?,,Democracy Now,-2,https://www.democracynow.org/2020/3/27/coronavirus_relief_bill_matt_stoller,We continue our look at the massive $2 trillion coronavirus relief package — the largest stimulus bill in U.S. history — with author Matt Stoller who argues the country will be unrecognizable after this pandemic if big corporations walk away with trillions of dollars and no strings attached. Stoller is research director at the American Economic Liberties Project and author of the book “Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy.” His recent column for The Guardian is headlined “The coronavirus relief bill could turn into a corporate coup if we aren’t careful.”TranscriptThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman. We’re broadcasting from the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States from New York City as we continue our look at the massive $2 trillion coronavirus relief package the largest stimulus bill in U.S. history with a guest who argues the country will be unrecognizable after this pandemic if big corporations walk away with trillions of dollars and no strings attached. Joining us via video stream is Matt Stoller as so many guests are representing are self-isolating in their homes to protect the larger community and themselves. Matt Stoller research director at the American Economic Liberties Project author of the book _Goliath: The 100-Year War Between Monopoly Power and Democracy.” His column for The Guardian is headlined “The coronavirus relief bill could turn into a corporate coup if we aren’t careful.”So the House is clearly passing this unprecedented $2.2 trillion bill today. Matt what are your concerns?MATT STOLLER: Well I mean it’s not really a $2 trillion bill. It’s more like a $6 trillion to $10 trillion bill. So one of the reasons you can tell that the bill is packed with corporate goodies is that you know Congress is debating and trying to figure out oh you know is it $2 trillion a bunch of money for hospitals or money for cities and meanwhile a couple days ago Larry Kudlow is on a press conference and says “Actually this is a $6 trillion bill.” And it’s like how does a bill go from $2 trillion to $6 trillion without anyone really noticing? And the answer is there’s a bunch of stuff in there — and you know there are people on Wall Street chattering about how it’s actually going to be $10 trillion because you know what’s another four? And that’s how you know that the bill is just packed with stuff for Wall Street for large monopolists.And it’s done through a variety of opaque slush funds — the Federal Reserve the FDIC guarantees a bank debt. There’s a whole bunch of stuff that you know some of us who worked in the financial crisis noticed paid attention to said “Oh that’s where they’re stealing all the money.” And so there’s a bunch of stuff in there that’s going to get to Boeing and airlines that we know about has been reported. There’s also a bunch of stuff that’s going to get to the hedge fund guys that are bunkering down in their underground wine caves or whatever. And meanwhile the stuff that we need for normal people — the ventilators the unemployment — you know that’s going to dribble out. Small business is going to dribble out.And so what you’re going to see is the $4 trillion to $6 trillion to $8 trillion of basically no-cost or low-cost guaranteed credit is going to be used by Citibank JPMorgan and then any big monopolist or large company that can get access to it to buy up their competitors and buy up small business who are obviously now in a really distressed state because they don’t have any revenue. So that’s what’s going to happen. And I look forward to all of the progressives who are supporting this like Congresswoman Ilhan Omar supporting a wealth tax later on for all the wealth that they are right now transferring to Wall Street. That will be fun.AMY GOODMAN: CNBC’s Jim Cramer said last Friday the economic downturn from the pandemic could leave the United States with just three retailers after the crisis ends.MATT STOLLER: That’s right.AMY GOODMAN: This is what he said.JIM CRAMER: We come out of this sooner then other small businesses can open. If we come out of this later David there’s going to be three retailers in this country. There’s going to be Amazon there’s going to be Walmart and there’s going to be Costco. And that is something that the government cannot afford to have happen.AMY GOODMAN: So Matt Stoller if you can respond to what Cramer said? While President Trump stands at the White House podium saying “We’re spending much more time concerned about small business than big business” he didn’t say “We’re spending much more money concerned about small business than big business.”MATT STOLLER: I don’t think that this is actually — I don’t want to leave this on Trump. Honestly this is the fault of the Democrats this is the fault of Nancy Pelosi it’s the fault of members like Ilhan Omar who just spoke about this not paying attention to what’s in the bill. It’s the fault of Bernie Sanders. It’s the fault of Elizabeth Warren. These are the people that had leverage that had the ability to make an argument about what this bill is. And instead of saying that this bill is a handout to corporate America and a roll-up of power they decided to stay quiet let Chuck Schumer organize the whole process you know and do some moral grandstanding. And it’s really embarrassing and it’s really a problem because they’re lying to the progressive movement they’re lying to the Democratic Party. And so now we have no debate about what is effectively probably a more significant bill than TARP in 2008.And all of this stuff that’s happening the handover of power to Wall Street is happening under the really cynical guise of helping people in a pandemic. A lot of this money is going to go to — some of the money is going to go to hospitals. Some of the money is going to go to help people in the pandemic. So there’s some good stuff here. That of course is going to dribble out on the rickety infrastructure of the Small Business Administration and unemployment insurance. Our government has been hollowed out so this stuff isn’t going to get out quickly but — quickly enough.But I think we really have to take some responsibility as Democrats — I’m a Democrat — as progressives as conservatives as Republicans. You know this is a total system failure. This is a handover of power to Wall Street. And in a month or two or three people are going to get confused. They’re going to say “Wait a second. Why isn’t this working? What’s happening?” And like this is the moment. The moment was this week when the House and Senate are voting on it. And you have a whole bunch of largely clueless either stupid corrupt or cowardly members who won’t actually look at what’s in the bill won’t organize won’t think about it won’t debate. And so they’ve handed over — you know I didn’t think that Bernie Sanders was going to hand the country over to big business but that is effectively what he did. I didn’t think Elizabeth Warren was going to do that but that is effectively what she did.AMY GOODMAN: You’re attributing a lot of power to them.MATT STOLLER: Absolutely. The leverage point here was about the public debate. Last week when Mitch McConnell was coming up with a bill — you know and I wrote about this but others wrote about it —AMY GOODMAN: Not including the Democrats in this.MATT STOLLER: Well yeah but the Democrats didn’t make an argument about what was in that bill. They said “Oh OK trillions of dollars for Wall Street sure we’ll call that pandemic relief” instead of saying “That’s trillions of dollars for Wall Street. What we need is immediate pandemic relief.” Instead they conceded to Mitch McConnell and Steve Mnuchin that giving a trillion $2 trillion $3 trillion $4 trillion to Wall Street was pandemic relief. And that’s just nonsense. And even today they’re not saying what is in this bill. They don’t even know that the bill is $6 trillion versus $2 trillion. I mean the whole thing is just embarrassing and dishonest. Now I could see them saying “Yeah you know it is a $6 trillion bill” — I mean I’ll also say I have to — you know we have to get money out to hospitals. We have to get money out to small business. We have to get money out to ordinary people that are suffering right now. It’s a real — we have to do it. And it will happen. If the Democrats had gotten together and blocked this bill then you know Mitch McConnell and Mnuchin and Kevin McCarthy and Trump would have had no choice but to accept any deal that the Democrats put on the table.AMY GOODMAN: Well let me play presidential candidate Bernie Sanders speaking Wednesday night about the unprecedented well more than $2 trillion emergency relief bill.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: I am very very very concerned about a $500 billion that will go out to the corporate world without — let me underline without — the accountability and transparency that is needed. We do not need at this moment in history to provide a massive amount of corporate welfare to large profitable corporations. I think as many of you are aware you have industry like the — industries like the airlines industry among others that have provided for stock buybacks billions and billions of dollars for stock buybacks. They spent all their cash rewarding themselves and their stockholders. And lo and behold today they need a major bailout.So the concern here is: A do we trust the Trump administration to effectively decide which company will get the loans or the grants? The answer is no I do not. Do we think that these loans and grants during a political season will be used to benefit the president’s election prospects? Absolutely I do.AMY GOODMAN: So Matt Stoller that’s Bernie Sanders. I also want to ask about the 0% interest loans then buy bonds and stocks that yield 2 to 6% interest. Who gets to do this?MATT STOLLER: So first of all that $500 billion that Bernie was talking about it’s actually more like $4.5 trillion. So just an FYI.If you have — basically if you have an account at a large bank if you’re a wealthy investor like Goldman Sachs there’s a whole set of programs that you can get access to at the Federal Reserve — at least this was the case in 2008 and the Fed says they’re setting up similar structures — where you can borrow from the Fed and you can gamble with it. And then if you lose — right? — in your gambling then the Fed will — you don’t have to pay the loan back to the Fed. So that’s one of the — you know and this is one of the programs they say “Oh we need to provide liquidity in the markets” or various other really super boring things that sound like — you kind of go to sleep when you’re like “Oh all these alphabet soup programs and all this kind of jargon.” But that’s really what it is. It’s just you know “heads I win; tails you lose.” And that’s a lot of what these programs are.I mean the Fed has already hired BlackRock which is one of the world’s largest asset managers to manage this multitrillion-dollar bailout and they’ve said that BlackRock is going to be allowed to participate in the bailout. So they’re running the bailout and they’re participating in the bailout. They’re already stealing before the vote the bill has even passed the House.I mean this is just like for most of — for a lot of us who worked in the financial crisis this is just embarrassing. It’s a bad joke to watch it go through with like literally no opposition from anyone in power. And I’m sorry but Bernie Sanders getting up and grandstanding about an unemployment provision that he didn’t negotiate that was going to die anyway that’s embarrassing and it’s dishonest and he shouldn’t lie to his supporters like that.AMY GOODMAN: Well Matt Stoller we’re going to do a post-show with you and continue the discussion and particularly look at something that no one is paying attention to in the coronavirus pandemic and that is the issue of a decision around — the Supreme Court making around Comcast and racial discrimination.MATT STOLLER: Sure.AMY GOODMAN: You’ve written a lot about this.

What happens when you’re trapped at home with your abuser? “This is really a dire situation for a lot of victims across the country” says Katie Ray-Jones chief executive officer of the National Domestic Violence Hotline and loveisrespect.TranscriptThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! democracynow.org The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman broadcasting from New York City now the center of the pandemic in the United States.Shelter in place? What happens when you’re trapped at home with your abuser? We turn now to look at domestic violence during the pandemic. As schools shut public spaces close all but essential workers are ordered to stay indoors domestic violence services are scrambling to help vulnerable people navigate home lives they say are increasingly unsafe during the pandemic. More than one in three women in the U.S. has experienced rape physical violence or stalking by an intimate partner according to a 2010 survey. In 2018 more than half the violent crimes in the U.S. were domestic violence cases.We end with Katie Ray-Jones chief executive officer of the National Domestic Violence Hotline and loveisrespect. She’s joining us from Austin Texas.Thanks so much for being with us Katie Ray-Jones. Talk about what you’re experiencing now on the National Domestic Violence Hotline. What are your greatest concerns during this pandemic where so many are shut in are locked down in their homes around the country?KATIE RAY-JONES: Yeah good morning. Yeah absolutely. I think you’re speaking very much to the crux of what we’re most concerned with right now. We know that many victims and survivors of domestic violence are currently sheltering in place with their abusive partner and we have started to hear from many survivors who are explaining to us about how COVID-19 is impacting their relationship how abuse is beginning to escalate in the home or how they’re being further isolated from their social networks their social support systems employment financial impact. It’s quite a scary situation for many women across the country.AMY GOODMAN: So what are you hearing? What do you tell people? What can you suggest to those who are terrified at home right now? We say the words “shelter in place.” It’s hardly a shelter.KATIE RAY-JONES: Yeah I mean you make a really great point. This is really a dire situation for a lot of victims across the country. What we’ve been hearing is that we have had situations where the survivor is trying to leave but shelters are currently not doing intakes or they’re full. They cannot go to their family members or their friends’ houses in fear of exposure. Certainly if their parents are elderly they’re not wanting to go and take their children over there. We’re really hearing a lot of scary stories about how one woman was being prevented to go to work. She wasn’t in a community where there was a shelter in place. And her partner brought out a firearm and began to load the firearm as a method to keep her in the home. And she said that had never happened before. This was the first time she had seen something like this escalate. We’ve also heard from women who ended up calling 911 and that when police came out they said that these were low violent crimes and they weren’t in a position to detain the abusive partner. And so that’s a scary situation for a lot of survivors.What we’re really hoping to do right now recognizing that it is going to be very difficult for a survivor to call a hotline when their perpetrator is sitting right next to them or to be able to enter into an online chat with an advocate when their abusive partner is watching what they’re doing — there could be serious consequences for a survivor in those situations. So we’re imploring friends family neighbors to contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline on behalf of someone else because you may be their only lifeline to education safety information while we’re working through situations where people can’t flee the home.AMY GOODMAN: And what’s happening to emergency shelters right now for domestic violence victims?KATIE RAY-JONES: I think we’re seeing an array of different strategies being used which I think it makes it really difficult for survivors to know what their options are. One we’re hearing some shelters are still operating and putting in a lot of procedures to keep their current residents safe and healthy. Some are using motels and hotels to be able to place people in emergency situations. But we know many nonprofits on a good day are underresourced and don’t have a lot of financial resources to leverage hotels and motels for those expenses. Some are not doing intakes right now in order to keep their current residents healthy safe. And some are just at capacity.So what we’re doing is as survivors are calling us we’re working with those local communities to try to place them. We had a pastor who called us yesterday trying to get shelter for a victim and had looked in two different states and wasn’t being successful in finding a location for that individual. So we know that these are really dire. So unfortunately we’re doing a lot of safety planning in-place strategies. We’re talking with survivors about if a fight breaks out a violent incident breaks out in the home where’s the safest place to move in the home. Can you take time for yourself whether it’s a shower journaling taking just a quiet moment to be able to gather your strength recognizing that you are courageous you’re strong you’re brave you’re surviving every day? But there’s not a lot of resources out there right now Amy for people to actually get connected to.AMY GOODMAN: I want to thank you so much Katie Ray-Jones for being with us chief executive officer of the National Domestic Violence Hotline. And the number of that hotline?KATIE RAY-JONES: 1-800-799-7233 or you can chat at thehotline.org.AMY GOODMAN: We want to thank you so much.KATIE RAY-JONES: Thank you.AMY GOODMAN: And this word of advice in protecting the whole community it is so critical that in order not to wash our hands of all of this we simply wash our hands. When you see somebody and you’re afraid to step away because you don’t want them to feel like you’re afraid of them don’t think of them as the vector of disease. Think of yourself as possibly one who could infect others because we can’t know at this point. Step away. Be at a safe distance to make the whole community safe. And when you wash your hands to understand why this is so important is just simple water and soap. I know for many it is not even possible to get that water. But if you have access and soap soap is critical. It is the most important weapon because the coronavirus — corona is the crown on the virus which is a lipid and the soap cuts through that. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds. You know how you see doctors on TV shows washing their hands and then putting their arms up? This is the way to do it. Sing “Happy Birthday” twice if you want to. But you’ve got to scrub those hands. You’ve got to interlace your fingers and scrub. Scrub your fingertips you know that touches oh everything from buttons to elevator buttons everything else. Wash the back and the front of your hands. You’re doing it for yourself you’re doing it for your family you’re doing it for the whole community to stop community spread. We have to keep each other safe in this very dire time of this pandemic.That does it for the show. I want to thank the amazing team that makes Democracy Now! happen every day so many of us working from home in isolation to protect everyone else and the team that comes in to do this broadcast. And also a belated birthday happy wishes to Miriam Barnard.Democracy Now! produced by Mike Burke Deena Guzder Nermeen Shaikh Carla Wills Tami Woronoff Libby Rainey Sam Alcoff John Hamilton Robby Karran.

285,“In a Week We Will Be Italy”: NYC ER Doctor Says the U.S. Pandemic Will Only Get Worse,,Democracy Now,-2,https://www.democracynow.org/2020/3/26/nyc_hospitals_coronavirus,As New York hospitals see a surge in coronavirus cases medical workers report growing shortages of protective gear and a nurse who tested positive after treating patients with the highly contagious disease has died. “It’s pretty dire inside New York City hospitals right now” says New York City emergency room doctor Craig Spencer. “We have a growing number of patients coming in every day with coronavirus. We have people young and old with complications without complications who get put on mechanical ventilators who get put on life support to help their breathing who have cardiac arrest. It’s a daily reality for many of my colleagues on the frontline.” Spencer is also a survivor of Ebola which he contracted while fighting its outbreak in Africa.TranscriptThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.AMY GOODMAN: We’re going to begin right here in New York City the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States hospitals seeing the same surge in coronavirus cases that overwhelmed healthcare systems in China Italy and Spain. Refrigerated trucks and tents have been stationed outside of some hospitals to hold the bodies of the dead as morgues fill up. In 24 hours on Tuesday 13 people reportedly died at Elmhurst Hospital Center a 545-bed public hospital in the borough of Queens. The New York Times reports quote “In several hours on Tuesday Dr. Ashley Bray performed chest compressions at Elmhurst Hospital Center on a woman in her 80s a man in his 60s and a 38-year-old who reminded the doctor of her fiancé. All had tested positive for the coronavirus and had gone into cardiac arrest. All eventually died.” Dr. Bray called the situation “apocalyptic.”New York City is reporting 366 deaths and more than 33000 confirmed cases — almost half of all the cases in the United States though the number is expected to be so much higher due to the lack of tests. More than 4000 coronavirus patients have been hospitalized in New York City. A leaked FEMA briefing shows all the more than 1800 intensive care beds in the city are expected to be full by Friday and the state has called for tens of thousands more ventilators hospital beds and intensive care beds.This comes as workers at New York City hospitals report shortages of personal protective equipment as they work amidst patients with the highly contagious disease. Workers for the massive Mount Sinai Health System shared photos online of themselves wearing trash bags for protection. A New York City nurse who was treating coronavirus patients has died after testing positive about two weeks ago. Mount Sinai West nursing manager Kious Jordan Kelly was in his forties and his co-workers described him as compassionate devoted to his patients.For more we’re joined by Dr. Craig Spencer. He is director of global health in emergency medicine at Columbia University Medical Center. Dr. Spencer contracted Ebola while fighting its outbreak in Africa and survived the disease. He’s now an emergency room doctor in New York City where he’s treating coronavirus patients. He’s also on the board of Doctors Without Borders. And again with us our co-host Nermeen Shaikh.We welcome you both to Democracy Now! Dr. Craig Spencer describe a day in the New York City hospitals. We just laid out this graphic picture of shortage. And the question is: How unnecessary was this the idea that in this country the richest in the world doctors people like you and nurses and the staff of the hospitals going to those who even clean the hospitals do not have access to the necessary protection to treat the patients that are surging into these hospitals?DR. CRAIG SPENCER: Thanks for having me on and let me share the story. Look it’s pretty dire inside New York City hospitals right now and we’re all concerned about how that’s going to spread throughout the rest of the country or more frankly the rest of the world. It’s no surprise that the greatest number of cases are being reported in the places with the strongest or the best healthcare systems. We know that cases are spreading all over the world. We’re just picking them up more here and we’re seeing a lot more of the complications inside of our emergency departments. As has already been reported we have a growing number of patients coming in every day with coronavirus. We have people young and old with complications without complications who get put on mechanical ventilators who get put on life support to help their breathing who have cardiac arrest. It’s a daily reality for many of my colleagues on the frontline especially here in New York City.AMY GOODMAN: Nermeen?NERMEEN SHAIKH: I’d like to ask you Dr. Spencer — I mean one of the things as Amy mentioned that’s very striking is that the U.S. is of course extremely wealthy the wealthiest country in the world but it also has — according to the Global Health Security Index in 2019 the U.S. was the highest-ranked country in terms of pandemic preparedness. The U.S. was the best prepared. So if American hospitals are being overwhelmed in this way what about all of the other countries that don’t have the resources that the U.S. does?DR. CRAIG SPENCER: Yeah. I think if you asked anyone over the past couple years whether — anyone that does this for a living whether or not the U.S. was prepared for a pandemic we all would have said no. I think all of us have written articles in the past couple years lamenting the fact that the U.S. has torn apart the preparedness architecture here in the U.S. by underfunding the CDC by underfunding state and local departments of health. It’s not surprising to anyone that’s been looking at this or been worrying about this over the past couple years that this pandemic is wreaking such havoc here in the U.S.We’ve also drastically underfunded the World Health Organization despite the lessons we learned in West Africa in 2014 to 2016 with the Ebola crisis there. We learned that having preparedness was much more important than a reactive response. We learned that putting the right amount of funding into the organizations who are capable of picking up these disease threats and responding to them all over the world is the only way to protect people everywhere. It is so much cheaper. It is so much cheaper to invest in preparedness than it is to scramble for response. We’re putting together trillions of dollars to try and respond to this just here in the United States. And that amount of money would have provided for global preparedness for over a decade.And so we need to really think about our priorities. And I hope when we come out on the other side of this we think about where the smart investment is. The smart investment is not just trying to build a wall around this country with the hope that we’re going to keep microbes and bacteria out. The reality of our world right now is that wherever a disease starts — and it’s more likely to be in China than it is to be in Columbia Missouri — it can be anywhere in the world within 24 to 48 hours. And we are all at risk unless we have strong health systems in the places where the most vulnerable patients are.NERMEEN SHAIKH: And Dr. Spencer can you explain for people who don’t know the people — I mean in the U.S. most healthcare is privatized. So why is it that in private hospitals there is not sufficient — there isn’t sufficient personal protective equipment? Because not funding the CDC or cutting funding to the CDC etc. shouldn’t impact the decisions that private hospitals make about the equipment the beds etc. that they acquire.DR. CRAIG SPENCER: Yeah. You know it’s funny because we talk about these N95 masks. Those are those thicker variants that filter particles like the coronavirus. And generally we’re fit-tested in the hospital every year — it’s a requirement — to make sure that they fit right that nothing can get through. We almost never use them because in the U.S. we don’t have relatively many tuberculosis patients. We don’t have a lot of people where we have to use this type of protection. That’s not the reality in many of the places that I work — West Africa East Africa Southeast Asia etc. There they are just more used for a lot of the communicable diseases that we have stopped seeing as much here in the United States.The result is that a lot of my colleagues don’t have the same amount of experience of working with the personal protective equipment that we need right now. I see a lot of people who are you know touching the mask or putting it on or taking it off incorrectly. Personal protective equipment like gloves and masks do not protect you if they’re used incorrectly. One of the greatest risks when you’re using them is taking them off wrong touching your face touching the mask and infecting yourself.So it’s not surprising that we don’t have a huge supply of these things. We didn’t prepare for this scenario. And I think this is the most important message. So many people knew that this was coming. So many people knew that this was coming. You can look back and you can see headlines from three month ago three years ago. Everything that we learned in West Africa seemed to have been torn apart in decisions that you know seemingly undermine our willingness and our ability to respond to pandemics not only here in the United States but throughout the world.AMY GOODMAN: Dr. Spencer if you would take us on your personal journey what happened to you when you were dealing with Ebola in Africa about contracting it and then the lessons we can learn? And I want to particularly go to the issue of the egregious lack of tests and how that is a major public healthcare measure just for people to understand the lack of tests the lag in getting them and then even now the amount of time it takes for people — it can be four five 10 days to find out in fact even if they get the test — in New York very difficult — and what that means in terms of contagion. But start with yourself contracting Ebola.DR. CRAIG SPENCER: Yeah. So I worked in West Africa in Guinea in 2014. I was in Guéckédou another epicenter of an outbreak providing direct clinical care on a daily basis in full protective personal equipment with Doctors Without Borders. And I followed rigorous protocols every single day. My organization had been doing this for decades and had really done a great job in minimizing the risk to the providers and increasing the quality of care we could provide to our patients.That being said personal protective equipment is not flawless it’s not perfect even if used perfectly. At one point I was infected. When I came back to the U.S. I was thankfully treated here and received incredible quality care and was lucky enough to survive largely because I was treated in a really great health system. I was also really young and didn’t have any other medical issues. But the whole time the only thing I could think about were my colleagues and my friends back in West Africa that didn’t have access to the same quality of care. One thing I say is that in West Africa I took care of about 30 patients myself at any time and here in the U.S. I probably had 30 providers on call to take care of me at any time.Some of the stunning similarities and differences between West Africa and coronavirus is that yeah they’re both viruses. The coronavirus seems to infect more people and kill a relatively smaller percent versus Ebola. But the difference in terms of the fight was that in West Africa I at least never really had to worry about my personal protective equipment. A lot of my colleagues here in New York City are worried about the number of N95 respirators we have how limited our supply chain is. And if it’s bad here what is it going to look like in the rest of the country?And you bring up another really important point that we haven’t talked about I think enough and that is this issue of testing. Right now we’re talking about only testing certain people so only testing some healthcare workers only testing people that are hospitalized. It’s not because that’s the best thing to do. It’s because that’s really the only thing we can do right now. Testing capacity has increased dramatically in the past couple weeks but we are months delayed. We should have had a testing strategy like South Korea. We need to understand where this disease is is passing where it’s transmitting. And the only way to do that is to test test test and test. We haven’t been doing that. We’ve all been limited in our hospitals and in our communities. People are walking around now not knowing whether or not they’ve had coronavirus whether they may have some type of immunity whether they could be out in our communities helping other people if they have antibodies by delivering groceries to the elderly or helping in other institutions. So our testing strategy right now is such because we failed to be prepared. There were critical missteps in the testing capacity in the testing kits that were sent out. There were a lot of promises about our ability to do billions of — millions of beautiful tests for anyone that wanted one. That was never the reality on the frontline and that’s completely changed in the past couple weeks.AMY GOODMAN: So Dr. Craig Spencer if you could talk about the use of it as a public health measure that you understand and now as a result everyone must treat themselves as if they are contagious as if they’re infected to protect others in the community and yet you have President Trump — if you can respond to what he is saying that by Easter — right? — in just a few weeks he wants to see packed churches while the pope at the Vatican is telling people to wash their hands but not wash the feet of the worshipers while he is saying pray at home? Of course he’s in Italy which is so hard hit. And many are deeply concerned that the U.S. could go that route. What would stop us from going that route? And talk about the danger of President Trump’s message.DR. CRAIG SPENCER: Yeah. I think in a week we will be Italy. At least here in New York City we’re already seeing that. This is something I’ve been warning about for weeks. This is something Italy has been warning us about for weeks. In terms of what can stop this I don’t want to incite any panic; I want to incite some kind of preparation because we still have a huge country outside of New York City and the other epicenters right now that will be impacted by this virus in the coming weeks and the coming months.Look to respond to that let me just say that the first case of coronavirus was diagnosed here in New York City in early March so just over three weeks ago. Easter is you know just a couple weeks away two to three weeks away. The idea that we can have this dramatic spike in cases — which is still going up by the way — and that we’re somehow going to level off and be at a place where by Easter we’re going to have people back together again is dangerous and magical thinking. It defies all of the modeling that we’ve seen. It defies any of the reality any of my colleagues are seeing in the emergency department. And quite frankly going into work and seeing coronavirus patients and seeing them crash and decompensating get really sick really quickly is scary. But this idea of millions and millions of my fellow Americans all being in church or being in concert halls or being together in just a couple weeks gives me such pause knowing that this is the only way the virus can infect you. It cannot infect you if it cannot meet you. And by bringing people back together this is the greatest possible risk we have to continuing and worsening this pandemic fueling the flame across the United States.The most important message everyone needs to know right now is the only way that you can be safe is by staying home. The virus cannot infect you if it does not meet you. The streets may look empty I know but I assure you what’s happening within the walls of the emergency departments here in New York City and maybe next week in Newark and a week after that in New Mexico it is anything but the quietness and the calm you see on those empty city streets.AMY GOODMAN: Finally Dr. Craig Spencer what keeps you going? I mean you your colleagues all of the health staff of all of the hospitals in this country and around the world are so incredibly brave. You are the hardest hit. What gets you to that hospital every day?DR. CRAIG SPENCER: I just think it’s what we do. It’s our moral obligation. Yeah we want to do it with the right equipment. Yeah we want to do it with the right tools. But I think all of us have the sense of personal drive to be able to provide care. This is what I feel. This is what all of my colleagues have felt all the national staff I worked with in Guinea in 2014 and 2015. I remember just being so moved by their willingness and ability to come to work every single day despite their communities being destroyed by a virus. And I’ve learned so much from them so much that’s prepared me for this outbreak so much that I’ve tried to share with my colleagues now.And I think we really need to be thinking about the fact that yes the U.S. is really hard hit and it’s going to get worse in the next couple weeks. But let us not forget that there is a world outside of these borders. I have worked in a lot of places where not just the critical care doctors are in short supply but there may be no critical care beds there may be no ventilators there may be no ICUs or ability to provide the higher-quality care that we’re talking about right here in the United States. So it’s just a good reminder that the media is focused so much on what’s happening in New York City but I assure you that this is an issue and will be a greater issue everywhere else in the world. And just make sure we all keep everybody else in our thoughts.AMY GOODMAN: Dr. Craig Spencer I want to thank you so much for being with us director of global health —DR.

286,Bernie Sanders Fights for Laid-off Worker Protections in $2 Trillion Stimulus with Corporate Bailout,,Democracy Now,-2,https://www.democracynow.org/2020/3/26/coronavirus_relief_bill_bernie_sanders,The Senate unanimously approved a historic $2.2 trillion emergency relief package late Wednesday night to battle the unprecedented economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. The House will consider the bill Friday before it goes to President Trump’s desk to be signed into law. The bill would massively expand unemployment benefits providing laid-off workers up to 100% of their salary and health insurance benefits for four months. Vermont senator and presidential candidate Bernie Sanders successfully fought to strengthen the bill’s assistance to laid-off workers and voted “yes” even as he warned about the bill’s corporate bailout fund. “We do not need at this moment in history to provide a massive amount of corporate welfare to large profitable corporations” Sanders said in a video explaining his vote.TranscriptThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! democracynow.org The War and Peace Report. In a historic vote just before midnight the Senate unanimously approved a record-shattering $2.2 trillion emergency relief bill to battle the unprecedented economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. The House is set to vote on the bill on Friday. President Trump promises to sign it immediately. In a live-streamed legislative update Wednesday night Vermont senator presidential candidate Bernie Sanders spoke about who the bill will help.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: This package provides the largest expansion of unemployment benefits in American history an increase of over $250 billion. Under this bill average Americans who have been furloughed will be able to receive up to 100% of their salary and their health insurance for four months for four months. Weekly unemployment benefits will increase by $600. So if you were laid off your unemployment benefit will increase by $600 above what it otherwise would have been. And right now the average benefit is about $364 for workers.Now also very importantly this expansion of unemployment will include part-time workers. It will include gig workers like those who drive Uber cars. It will include tip workers and the self-employed who would otherwise not be covered by unemployment insurance. So in other words what we’re doing now is at a time when fewer than half of the American people would normally be covered by unemployment what this legislation does is it expands it to the overall workforce and on top of that for many workers would provide $600 a week more than they otherwise would have gotten. And that is one of the more important provisions in the bill.In addition this bill provides $250 billion to go out in one-time checks of $1200 for adults and $500 for kids. Now let me be very honest. As some of you may know I wanted much more. I wanted every American family to be able to receive $2000 every single month that we continue to exist within the crisis. So this does not do that. And this is clearly not enough to me but that is what it is.AMY GOODMAN: That’s Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders speaking Wednesday night about the unprecedented $2.2 trillion emergency relief bill. The legislation would also provide $150 billion in direct aid to states and municipalities more than $220 billion in tax benefits to companies almost $120 billion in aid to hospitals and for veterans’ healthcare and a half-a-trillion-dollar fund to provide loans and loan guarantees for corporations. Senator Sanders and other progressive critics are sounding the alarm over the corporate bailout portion of the bill and its limited oversight measures.SEN. BERNIE SANDERS: I am very very very concerned about a $500 billion that will go out to the corporate world without — let me underline without — the accountability and transparency that is needed. We do not need at this moment in history to provide a massive amount of corporate welfare to large profitable corporations. I think as many of you are aware you have industry like the — industries like the airlines industry among others that have provided for stock buybacks billions and billions of dollars for stock buybacks. They spent all their cash rewarding themselves and their stockholders.

287,“Chaotic Situation”: India Begins Lockdown of 1.3 Billion Residents as Coronavirus Pandemic Spreads,,Democracy Now,-2,https://www.democracynow.org/2020/3/26/amitav_ghosh_india_coronavirus_lockdown,As the coronavirus pandemic spreads around the world we look at India which is now under the largest lockdown in human history with 1.3 billion people ordered to shelter in place. As the country’s economy and daily life come to an abrupt halt hundreds of millions of Indians who live hand to mouth have been left without the means to support their families. We speak with Amitav Ghosh whose books include “Gun Island” and “The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable.”TranscriptThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! democracynow.org. I’m Amy Goodman in the studio with Nermeen Shaikh in self-isolation in New York City. We’re turning to India now where Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered the largest lockdown in human history starting Wednesday telling the country’s 1.3 billion people to shelter in place. With 693 confirmed coronavirus cases and 13 dead India’s three-week lockdown is an attempt to stave off the skyrocketing death tolls and overwhelmed health systems already seen in China Italy Spain and now the United States.But as the country’s economy and daily life comes to an abrupt halt hundreds of millions of Indians who live hand to mouth have been left without the means to support their families. More than 80% of India’s workforce is informal with most living off daily wages often less than $2 or $3 a day wages they cannot earn under the present curfew. Some states including Uttar Pradesh and Kerala have announced economic relief packages for workers and the poor and Modi’s government is expected to do the same in the coming days. But critics say Modi’s response to the coronavirus crisis has left India’s poor to fend for themselves with migrant workers left stranded at now-closed train and bus stations with no way to get home and millions wondering how they’ll survive weeks and potentially months without work.Meanwhile India’s testing lags far behind other nations leading to fears the actual number of COVID-19 infections is far far higher than reported. As of Tuesday India had conducted only 15000 tests — 15000 in a nation of 1.3 billion.Well for more we’re joined by the award-winning Indian writer Amitav Ghosh joining us from his home in Brooklyn New York where he is sheltering in place. His books include Gun Island and The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable.Thanks so much for being with us. Let’s start with what’s happening in India. Let’s talk about this largest lockdown in human history. What do you understand is going on Amitav?AMITAV GHOSH: Well it seems to be a very chaotic situation. You know let me say first of all that one of the terrible things about this lockdown is that it should have happened a lot earlier. I mean I’ve been self-isolating here in Brooklyn for almost three weeks now. And I talk to my friends and my family every day back in India. And really for three weeks they were just not taking this seriously at all. And those signals have to come from the government. For example Floyd Cardoz I’m told — you know he was a friend of mine. I’m really devastated to hear about his passing. But I’m told he had a huge party in Bombay earlier this month. And you know if they had shut down these sort of big gatherings and so on two to three weeks ago it would have served an enormous purpose but they didn’t.And so this lockdown has come as a huge surprise. My family back in Calcutta they’re completely panicked because they didn’t have time to go out and buy food or anything. And you know I’m just talking about my family. As for the 80% of India’s employment is in the informal sector and those people are just completely devastated. You saw the picture of people being beaten by the police. A lot of informal workers are now out on the streets. They lived on the streets anyway. They have no way to get back to their homes which are maybe hundreds of miles away. They’re just stuck on the street. Yesterday I saw a horrifying video of a young boy being beaten by the police. And he was just out on the street because there was nowhere — he had nowhere to go. You see these pictures of workers carrying their children on their heads trying to walk back hundreds of miles to their families. It’s just a shocking situation.NERMEEN SHAIKH: And Amitav Ghosh what do you expect will happen now? What are you learning from your family? Because at the moment this lockdown is supposed to last for three weeks. What are you hearing though about how long it’s likely to continue beyond that? And also what provisions the Modi government has put in place if any for people under curfew to get access to even basic goods — food drinking water etc.?AMITAV GHOSH: Well the government has announced some sorts of relief measures and it varies from state to state in India. So Kerala has actually been very proactive and they’ve acted very early amongst Indian states. How effective these measures will be I just don’t know. You know even delivery workers are being beaten by the police. It just makes absolutely no sense. Journalists trying to get to work are being beaten by the police. Healthcare workers are being beaten. So you know as far as I can see it’s kind of this strange situation of chaos and panic building upon each other.So you know middle-class families like mine are able to stockpile a certain amount of food at home. But you think of the people who are stuck in tiny shanties who have really not the ability to even stockpile any food. And the weather is turning hotter and hotter. They’re stuck inside. It’s just going to be appalling for them.And let me say straightaway that the reported numbers we just cannot trust at all. We know now that really the numbers reported are a function of the testing. And as Amy said earlier very few Indians have been tested. What? It’s like 15000 in a huge country? So I mean again another statistic that is not at all trustworthy is the number of people who are dying because a very large number of deaths in India are not actually reported or they’re not certified by doctors. So we really have no idea at all of what’s going on on the ground.NERMEEN SHAIKH: And Amitav could you elaborate a little bit more? You’ve suggested here the extraordinary inequality in the effects and spread of this virus — of course here in the United States but perhaps with different orders of magnitude in countries like India with such a large population that is poor — who this virus is likely to impact the most and the relationship between these decades of — which you’ve pointed out — decades of neoliberalism and the populations that are going to be the most affected by this in India as well as here.AMITAV GHOSH: Well you know the sort of neoliberal sorts of policies that we’ve seen around the world have had the effect of greatly increasing inequality you know? So you see this terrible sort of cycle. I mean a lot of the informal workers in Delhi are actually farmers from areas that have been very badly hit by climate change. In 2016 for example there was a terrible drought in central India. Hundreds of thousands of people were leaving their villages every single day and flocking into cities like Delhi where they lived under flyovers. So what are those people going to do in this circumstance? How can they even return?Again you know obviously I mean people live in very close contact in slums in shantytowns. It’s going to spread very very fast over there. Those people are not going to be able to get themselves tested. They’re not going to be able to go to hospitals. In any case at this point in time I suspect hospitals are going to be the prime center for the transmission of this disease. You know we are seeing that around the world. There’s no reason to believe that that won’t be the case in India. So yes you know just take one example. I mean during this last week as the panic was beginning to spread in India migrant workers started piling into trains in thousands. You can imagine in a small train compartment how quickly this will spread.AMY GOODMAN: If you could comment Amitav Ghosh on President Trump going to India right at the time that people were saying he had to be speaking about coronavirus not only there but dealing with what’s happening in the United States as well but instead he was there at a stadium being celebrated not saying any word when it could have made such an enormous difference? And also talk more about — I mean your book is titled The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable very appropriate for what’s happening right now. But if you could talk more deeply about the connection between climate change and the growth of these viruses the spread of these viruses and what we haven’t taken seriously until this point?AMITAV GHOSH: Well yes you’re right. I mean just a few weeks ago President Trump was in India with the prime minister Narendra Modi. They were in a huge stadium with tens of thousands of people. I think it was hundreds of thousands actually. And you know you can just sense that this is a huge incubator of the disease. You know even a couple weeks ago there were massive cricket matches going on across India. It was just a spectacle of derangement. You know my book is called The Great Derangement and every single day I see more and more signs of this kind of derangement.So you know the relationship with climate change well as far as I can tell obviously one direct relationship is rising temperatures will create — will make the transmission of certain kinds of diseases easier in certain places. But I think we can’t think of it only in terms of a causal relationship. I think these things — this pandemic the global migration crisis so many other things — are actually all effects of this great acceleration that we’ve been seeing for the last 30 years starting in about 1990 since we’ve had this sort of neoliberal regime economic regime put in place across the world. Half of all of the greenhouse gas emissions that are in the skies right now come since 1990. So it’s exactly in this period that we’ve witnessed this incredible acceleration in travel in mobility all the things that make it possible for a pandemic like this to instantly as it were spread itself around the world.NERMEEN SHAIKH: And Amitav can you speak specifically on the question of this great acceleration to the Modi government’s policies specifically? I mean a lot of people have criticized the Modi government for the way in which it imposed this curfew and compared it to his decision to demonetize the currency a couple of years ago. So could you talk about the impact of the Modi government’s policies both on the question of inequality and the impact on the climate crisis of some of the policies that the Modi government has pursued?AMITAV GHOSH: See the lockdown announcement was made at 8 p.m. at night and the demonetization announcement was also made in a similar way. And the demonetization announcement created absolute panic that lasted for a long time disrupted lives and really rendered the informal sector very very vulnerable. They still have not recovered from that. So when this — when it was announced that the prime minister is going to make another sort of major announcement already that created a kind of incredible panic. And apart from that you know the last few months in India have been incredibly difficult. I mean the government also announced a set of changes in citizenship laws which has completely divided the country and created upheavals across the country. This couldn’t in fact have happened at a worse moment. So you know it’s going to create a lot of uncertainty a lot of panic going ahead. I don’t think anyone can really foresee what lies ahead in the next few weeks because I feel absolutely sure that three weeks is not enough. It’s going to be much more than that. You know we are just seeing the beginnings of this pandemic in India.So the Modi government’s policies from the start have been very anti-environmental. They’ve diluted the Forest Rights Act which protected the rights of many forest-dwelling indigenous peoples. They’ve even diluted things like — you know in India we had strict regulations about building close to the sea to the coast. You know there were strict regulations about leaving a certain amount of land that you couldn’t build on. So obviously hotels resorts all those sorts of lobbies they wanted that changed and they were able to push through a change. You just think about this moment in time with sea level rise and you’re suddenly allowed to build closer and closer to the sea. It’s a kind of madness. And you know especially the devastation that is happening in India’s forests forests being opened up to mining interests across India all of this is going to create absolute disaster because we can see that it’s that kind of ecological destruction it’s deforestation that creates the conditions for these animal-to-human transmissions of viruses.AMY GOODMAN: Amitav Ghosh we’re going to have to leave it there. I want to thank you for being with us India writer based in Brooklyn where he’s self-isolating author of The Great Derangement: Climate Change and the Unthinkable.And that does it for the show.

288,Frontline NY Nurses Lack Protective Masks & Ventilators Say Worst Yet to Come as COVID-19 Spreads,,Democracy Now,-2,https://www.democracynow.org/2020/3/25/frontline_healthcare_workers_ppe_shortage_coronavirus,As the New York metro area has 60% of all the new coronavirus cases in the United States and is responsible for half the cases all over the country New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday the number of hospitalizations is expected to peak in the next 40 days as hospitals are already encountering shortages of equipment needed to protect medical workers and to keep patients alive when the city’s COVID-19 cases peak in the coming weeks. We’re joined by two people on the frontlines of the pandemic: Sean Petty a registered nurse in the pediatric emergency room of a public hospital in the Bronx and member of the New York State Nurses Association board of directors and Kelley Cabrera an emergency room nurse at a public hospital in the Bronx.TranscriptThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.AMY GOODMAN: We’re broadcasting from the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States New York City with my co-host Juan González in New Jersey with the second most coronavirus cases in the country. The New York metro area has 60% of all the new coronavirus cases in the United States and is responsible for half the cases all over the country. The death toll in New York is 271 with more than 26000 confirmed cases. Almost half the cases in New York are among people between the ages of 18 and 45 years in age. Federal officials say anyone who travels from New York City should self-quarantine for 14 days.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday the number of hospitalizations is expected to peak in the next 40 days. Four temporary hospital sites will be built to address the shortfall of hospital beds including one at the Jacob Javits Convention Center in Midtown Manhattan. Cuomo blasted the Trump administration for failing to respond to the magnitude of the crisis and said hospitals are already encountering shortages of equipment needed to protect medical workers and to keep patients alive.GOV. ANDREW CUOMO: FEMA is sending us 400 ventilators. Four hundred ventilators? I need 30000 ventilators. You want a pat on the back for sending 400 ventilators? What am I going to do with 400 ventilators when I need 30000? You pick the 26000 people who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators!AMY GOODMAN: Many hospitals in New York say they’re already down to their last weeks of personal protective equipment to keep frontline medical workers from contracting COVID-19. Some are being forced to reuse single-use masks. If they get sick hospitals will face even greater staff shortages amidst the outbreak.For more we’re joined by two people who are working on the frontlines of this pandemic. Sean Petty is a registered nurse in the pediatric emergency room of Jacobi Hospital in the Bronx. He’s a member of the board of directors of the New York State Nurses Association. Next to him is Kelley Cabrera an emergency room nurse there as well. And of course co-hosting from his home in New Brunswick New Jersey is Juan Gonzalez.Sean let’s begin with you. Can you describe the conditions at your hospital? What do you need? What do you have?SEAN PETTY: Absolutely. Well the first thing that we need first and foremost is we need N95 masks. N95s are the only proven prevention in terms of masks for healthcare workers for N95 — or for COVID-19. In Wuhan China once they realized that healthcare workers were becoming infected and they imported 42000 healthcare workers to help with the crisis they outfitted them with N95 masks and full protective equipment personal protective equipment or PPE as we call it. And they achieved an unbelievable zero out of 42000 infection — noninfection rate. So zero healthcare workers out of 42000 with full PPE were infected after they were imported into Wuhan China.So we know that N95s are the only significant protection that we have against this virus. And they are the item that is in most severe shortage in this country. Just this morning as I was walking into the hospital and we heard of — we started hearing about reports of this just last night — our command center has been telling nurses that the one N95 mask that they are distributing is the only N95 mask that they’re going to be getting for an entire week. So this is a profound —AMY GOODMAN: Now I just want to be clear on how unusual this is. The head of the American Medical Association said if you did something like that — reuse reuse reuse a mask — it would have been grounds for dismissal in the past. Talk about the significance of what it means to reuse your mask Sean seeing patient after patient who are suffering from this highly contagious disease.SEAN PETTY: A hundred percent Amy. We would have absolutely been brought up on charges and possibly terminated for reusing a mask in the future. The CDC guidelines from the beginning of this outbreak — at the beginning of this outbreak were that COVID-19 patients were to be treated with airborne and contact precautions which necessitates an N95 mask by federal guidelines. They rolled those back caving into pressure from the hospital associations that were talking about their shortage. So they rolled their guidelines back not by science but because of — not because of science but because of the shortage. And so that allowed the hospitals to ration these masks in that way.And so what it means is that we take — we use a mask we touch the mask we take care patients our hands could potentially become contaminated our hands then contaminate our mask and then when we reuse it we potentially contaminate ourselves and then we’re putting other patients at risk. Now we take care of patients who are suspected of COVID-19 we take care of patients who have COVID-19 and we take care of patients who don’t have any symptoms of COVID-19. So we of course as healthcare workers then are not only infecting ourselves not only infecting each other as healthcare workers because it’s very difficult to practice social distancing in a healthcare setting when you’re like me and Kelley are in traumas in tight quarters taking care of patients we are infecting each other and we’re infecting — we’re potentially infecting other patients. So to contaminate our own masks and to compromise the integrity of those masks repeatedly makes those masks absolutely useless at a certain point. And you’re absolutely right that this is something that is not — something that the hospitals would have disciplined nurses prior to this and something that they’re mandating us to do in this current context.JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Kelley Cabrera I’d like to ask you about another critical component of the best possible care the issue of ventilators. We heard Governor Cuomo blast the federal government for not providing sufficient numbers of ventilators. What’s the situation in your hospital with ventilators?KELLEY CABRERA: Yeah so I work at the same hospital as Sean in the adult emergency room and so I am taking care of the older population. And we have been seeing as you guys have stated before the numbers between 18 and 45 like those numbers are a lot higher. We know we don’t have enough. It’s a discussion that doctors are having that nurses are having. It’s a conversation that is way out in the open. Previously prior to coronavirus if there was a patient coming in who we knew needed a ventilator it was no questions asked. You went in and you provided that care and that was it. And we’re starting to see the situations where unfortunately we’re really — we have to debate you know is it worth — it’s horrible to say it this way but we really have to debate like: Is it worth exposing all of our workers when we know that we don’t have the right equipment and when we know the machines aren’t going to be enough? So those conversations are starting to happen. I’ve heard at other facilities in the Bronx already that ventilators have run out. For us that hasn’t happened yet but it’s definitely not looking good. It’s going to happen. And it’s a conversation that unfortunately we’re forced to have now.JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And I’d also like to ask you Kelley about the — Governor Cuomo has asked all the hospitals to increase capacity by 50% in terms of beds. Have you seen that process begin in your hospital? And of course increasing the number of beds also requires having more staff as well to deal with those beds. How has that been playing out in your hospital?KELLEY CABRERA: Yeah that is starting to happen now. I think a really big message here is that we have to remember that a lot of the issues that we’re seeing come up now they’re not new issues. So prior to coronavirus we were already holding patients in our emergency room for days at a time not just our emergency room. I know that this happens across the country in several hospitals because hospitals have always been stretched to their limit. So now we’re just adding the stress of a pandemic to it and it’s pushing us to new places we’ve never seen before.So we have opened up new spaces in the hospital. Prior to this we had advocated for that space before for the previous patients that we were holding in the emergency room. And now that space is being used by shuffling other patients in the hospital to that empty space in order to make more rooms on the floors for more ICU patients. I know there’s been conversions of different units into — that are specifically going to be for ICUs. Yesterday our waiting room started — they started construction in our waiting room to expand an area for where these patients will be taken care of. Like they are building a wall within our waiting room because we have to do it one way or another. Like to increase 50% capacity it’s making us do the craziest things. We’re putting patients together that perhaps we wouldn’t have put together before. We’re trying to put people — the biggest issue right now is space lack of equipment lack of ventilators but we’re trying to — we know that the surge is going to happen and all we’re trying to do is best prepare for it. And unfortunately it’s making us make some really hard decisions.AMY GOODMAN: Kelley Cabrera can you talk more about testing of healthcare workers like you? What kind of access do you have to healthcare tests? I mean I believe something like four in five cases people are infected by people who are asymptomatic. Now certainly you are on the frontline. You’re using and reusing your protective equipment. If you’re feeling sick what kind of access do you get to tests? And then how long do you have to wait and work while you might not be feeling well before you get results?KELLEY CABRERA: So we’ve been told that if we don’t feel well we are supposed to — you know we should be going home. It’s kind of what’s being said. However we know from — I’ve experienced like from speaking to other — excuse me — from other workers that have gone through this it’s basically you have to have a fever body aches and they ask you basically the same symptoms as we would ask any other patient that comes into the emergency room. However for us we have to — it’s not guaranteed that we’re going to get a test just because we work on the frontlines. So initially we were advocating for that being that we knew that a lot of us were getting exposed and obviously like we might not display symptoms and we might be passing it along to other people. But I think from what the mayor had said as well it’s just like we have to all basically assume that we have it. From other workers that I’ve heard that have been tested and have been told that they are positive they are to stay at work — sorry they’re to stay at home for seven days and then wait the three days — have at least three days without a fever before being able to return to work. It’s not guaranteed that we’re going to get tested at all. Like we have to go through the same process. We have to call 311. I believe our hospital also has a different hotline for us as well but basically we’re following the same guidelines as the general public even though we have arguably the most exposure.JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well I’d like to ask Sean — going back to this issue of hospital capacity over the last few decades and certainly during the period that Governor Cuomo has been in office the number of beds available per patient in the United States in many states has declined dramatically mostly because hospital managers see empty beds as not money-making so they want to reduce the number of empty beds as much as possible so they staff fewer and fewer beds. Could you talk about these past policies and now with this sudden crisis how the chickens have come home to roost in terms of this maximum bottom line for hospitals?SEAN PETTY: Yeah absolutely. And I would just add that it’s just not hospital managers. It’s actually all of our — all of the people who are making political and economic decisions around public health in the city and the state. So for instance I would call Governor Cuomo probably the single most important person in terms of the drive to close down hospital beds in this state over the last 20 years. In New York state we’ve gone from 73000 beds to 53000 beds from the year 2000 to the present time. So specifically because of policies that Governor Cuomo has pursued we are now 20000 beds behind where we need to be in terms of trying to scale up our capacity to these unprecedented levels. Governor Cuomo estimates I think this week that we need 140000 hospital beds to have enough capacity to treat patients that need oxygenation and hospitalization during this crisis. So we’re starting at 53000 instead of 73000 to scale up to this to scale up to the need that is being estimated. So the way Governor Cuomo did that is he came up with a hospital bed closure commission. It was called the Berger Commission. And he also has had now two rounds of Medicaid cuts. The first — they’re called the Medicaid Redesign Teams. The second Medicaid Redesign Team just made a recommendation for massive Medicaid cuts including specific cuts to the city hospital system where we work just in the last two weeks. So Governor Cuomo is currently trying to reduce Medicaid spending in the state by almost $2.5 billion during this pandemic. And this will absolutely result in a decrease in healthcare capacity and keep the state from getting matching federal dollars for Medicaid spending.So it’s unfathomable to somebody like myself somebody who has worked in a public hospital for 12 years and has seen these cuts seen the resulting decrease in staffing seen the resulting decrease in services. We had to fight a couple years ago just to keep our pediatric trauma center open in the Bronx the only pediatric trauma center that serves the entire borough of the Bronx and southern Westchester County. We had to fight to keep it open because of these Medicaid cuts. We thankfully won that fight but we have been at a severe state of precarity when it comes to having these services available over the last decade going into this pandemic. And these are because of these specific policies of Medicaid cuts and hospital closures that have been explicitly pursued. And it’s very easy to find all of the quotes from Governor Cuomo from the Medicaid Redesign Teams from the Berger Commission about these hospital closures in New York state over the last two decades.AMY GOODMAN: And we don’t want to keep you Sean. We know you’re right now scheduled to go on duty. What gives you the courage to be there day after day with the massive exposure that you have?SEAN PETTY: Well I think a sense of duty to my patients. If we don’t show up if we’re not there nobody else is going to be. And I would also just add that I know nurses are getting a lot of attention right now but it’s also our housekeepers are heroes right now our nurses’ aides are heroes right now the doctors. We all are coming to work. We all are doing Herculean — making Herculean efforts to make this thing work. We all are exposing ourselves to these risks. And we know that we’re at the very tip of the iceberg. And so you know but if not us who else is going to do it? And we only ask — and we do this — you know I’ve done this for 12 years. Kelley has done it for six years. We do this every day. We face adverse conditions every day. We face going into battle short-staffed. We face these things. So it’s something we’re used to. It’s something we’re prepared for. What I think undermines that courage and undermines that morale for us and our co-workers is that our government doesn’t have our back that the Trump administration and the federal authorities have done virtually nothing to get us the armor and the supplies that we need in this war against coronavirus.AMY GOODMAN: Sean Petty I want to thank you so much for being with us joining us from Jacobi Hospital in the Bronx pediatric emergency room nurse. And thank you so much to Kelley Cabrera emergency room nurse as well.When we come back we go to Spain which now has more than 47000 confirmed cases nearly 3500 deaths the second-highest number in the world after Italy.

Many face limited availability of protective equipment. So many people have died that Madrid’s municipal funeral home has stopped collecting bodies. A large ice rink is now being used as a makeshift morgue and the government plans to extend the state of emergency by another 15 days in order to stop the spread of the coronavirus. “If Madrid was a country it would actually be fifth in terms of death rate in the entire world” says María Carrión journalist and former Democracy Now! news producer.TranscriptThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.AMY GOODMAN: We turn now to Spain one of the epicenters of the pandemic in Europe with over 47000 confirmed cases and nearly 3500 deaths — the second-highest number in the world after Italy. The number of new infections in Spain has multiplied at a rate of 20% in the last 24 hours. Health workers account for nearly 14% of Spain’s infections. Many face limited availability of protective equipment. So many people have died that Madrid’s municipal funeral home has stopped collecting bodies. A large ice skating rink is now being used as a makeshift morgue. Not far from the rink the venue for last year’s U.N. climate summit the IFEMA has been converted into a hospital ward with thousands of beds. Spain’s government has opened an investigation after soldiers found unattended bodies in some of the nursing homes the military has been disinfecting. As Spain faces its second week of lockdown the government plans to extend the state of emergency by another 15 days in order to stop the spread of the coronavirus.For more we go to Madrid for an update from María Carrión former Democracy Now! producer journalist in Spain head of FiSahara a film festival that airs in the Sahrawi refugee camps of Algeria.It’s great to have you back María. You’ve been now on lockdown for two weeks with your family in the heart of Madrid which is the epicenter of the epicenter Spain as it’s fast surpassing Italy in its rate of infection. Talk about what’s happening now and what the president is about to announce.MARÍA CARRIÓN: Well as you mentioned this is ground zero in Spain for number of deaths and infections. We have over 1500 deaths in Madrid. So if Madrid was a country it would actually be fifth in terms of death rate in the entire world between Iran and France.So this is day 12 of the lockdown. Everybody seems to be following it with very few exceptions. Hospitals are beginning to be overrun with cases of coronavirus. The ICU units are at capacity. And we have a scarcity of every kind of material that you can possibly imagine. So this is a repeat of what happened both in China and in Italy. Catalonia the region of Catalonia is also hard hit. It now has the highest infection rate new infection rate in the country. And as you mentioned 14% of healthcare workers at least have been infected which has taken out over 5000 people from giving care. They do not have the protective gear as I was hearing Sean and Kelley speak. The same thing is happening here as well. People are having to either recycle their gear or simply just make their own with whatever is lying around at home.So today Parliament is — an empty almost empty Parliament will be convening so via online telematic vote. They will be debating the extension of the state of exception. The president of Spain Pedro Sánchez will be speaking and explaining why this needs to be extended. And we’re expecting of course for everybody to vote for this measure and keep everyone at home except for certain workers that can still leave their home.AMY GOODMAN: And both he and the vice president Pablo Iglesias of Podemos both of their partners are COVID-19-positive?MARÍA CARRIÓN: Their partners are COVID-19-positive and they have gone in and out of isolation. They have broken their quarantine a few times to attend meetings but now meetings are all at a distance. There are a lot of politicians infected. We talked about this a few days ago. And of course the list is just increasing of politicians in Spain who are either in quarantine because they’ve been very close to virus infections or actually have tested positive and either at home or in hospital. Garzón we still don’t know — Baltasar Garzón the very renowned judge we still don’t know if he is positive but it is a suspected case because he has all the symptoms and was hospitalized for respiratory distress.The most vulnerable people here Amy are the ones that are really of concern. You mentioned the nursing homes where these bodies were found. In the news yesterday they were interviewing health workers caregivers in these and other nursing homes. And the director of one of these homes the Maravillas center in Madrid was running a fever sick but still at work and crying because she said that she didn’t have backups. She suspected all of her staff was infected but they could not stop working and caring for the elderly patients most of which they feared were also infected and some of which had already died. So this you know hearing Sean and Kelley talk about how these are preexisting problems here too nursing homes have been a problem for a long time understaffed underfunded. These are publicly financed but privately run facilities where oversight is not very good. And so we’re seeing a result of this: Our elders are dying.JUAN GONZÁLEZ: María I wanted to ask you about other vulnerable populations those in the prisons of Spain as well as the migrants. There’s a huge migrant population especially from Northern Africa in Spain. What’s the situation with migrants who are perhaps in detention or in precarious living situations?MARÍA CARRIÓN: Some centers are letting some people go but it’s still a pending issue. There’s not enough being done both in these migrant centers where people are being held and also in prisons jails and prisons in Spain. This is something that has not yet been dealt with.JUAN GONZÁLEZ: And I wanted to ask you The New York Times had a very — an amazing article today talking about medical doctors in the United States apparently hoarding potential treatments especially these drugs chloroquine and [hydroxychloroquine] that President Trump has been touting that these doctors have been prescribing them all around the country for themselves and their family members in essence hoarding them. And now pharmacists are complaining that actually doctors are involved in this. Do you have any examples of health professionals there sort of looking out for themselves rather than their patients?MARÍA CARRIÓN: Very few actually. I don’t think people are paying much attention to Trump from here so those drugs have not been hoarded that I know of. At the very beginning of the crisis we did hear about certain doctors hoarding face masks and taking them out. There was one doctor who took all of the face masks in the hospital and took them to his village and gave them to his neighbors. But that’s not generally the case or at least it’s not being reported on.AMY GOODMAN: And María if you could talk about the IFEMA? We were just with you working at the convention center which has now been turned into a massive hospital — ironically the place where the U.N. climate summit was and we’ve been dealing with this issue of the connection of climate crisis to these viruses that we’re seeing increasingly. And also the skating rink which is very personal for you being used as a morgue?MARÍA CARRIÓN: Yes indeed. IFEMA was converted into what is now Spain’s largest hospital. It has over a thousand beds including also intensive care units. And it doesn’t just bring in patients coronavirus patients who for the most part are not the most serious of cases; it also has opened a section for the unhoused. So there’s about 150 beds for people who do not have shelter or are being kicked out of shelters when — in the morning and they need a place to be and healthcare. So IFEMA has transformed itself and is now just full of beds and hundreds of people sleep in one same wing. That’s one thing.The ice rink is actually a big mall. It’s located close to IFEMA as you say but not only that very close to my daughters’ school. It is a place where they’ve gone ice skating where they regularly meet with their friends and have lunch. There’s movie theaters. They have celebrated birthdays. And we all of a sudden saw all these hearses enter this place. And so my older daughter Gabriela said “I don’t think I could go there again with my friends.”AMY GOODMAN: María we’re going to be touching back with you. María Carrión former Democracy Now! producer living in Madrid Spain where she’s a freelance journalist. She has been holed up with her two daughters and her partner for the last two weeks.

The pandemic follows a series of devastating earthquakes in Puerto Rico earlier this year and comes as the island continues to deal with fallout from Hurricane Maria which devastated Puerto Rico’s infrastructure and killed at least 3000. “One of the things that I think is evident is that with the Trump administration and FEMA we have to continue to remind them time and time again that we are people and that we deserve to be treated with the same sense of justice urgency and dignity as anybody else” says our guest San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz.TranscriptThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! democracynow.org The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman with Juan González as we head to Puerto Rico which just announced a record $787 million financial package to fight the economic impact of the pandemic. It’s a bigger package than any U.S. state so far comes as the island’s death toll hits two with 51 cases reported. Measures include a three-month moratorium on mortgage payments and other loans; bonuses for essential service providers such as medical staff and police; new tablets and educational tools to improve remote education. Governor Wanda Vázquez said Puerto Rico’s public sector employees will keep getting paid and small businesses and self-employed workers will receive cash to cope with the crisis. She ordered an island-wide curfew and the closing of nonessential businesses. The pandemic follows a series of devastating earthquakes in Puerto Rico earlier this year and comes as the island continues to deal with the fallout from Hurricane Maria which devastated Puerto Rico’s infrastructure and killed at least 3000 people.For more we’re joined on the telephone by San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz. And co-hosting with us from his home in New Brunswick New Jersey is Juan González.Mayor Cruz welcome back to Democracy Now! Can you talk about what’s happening now in Puerto Rico? I understand you’ve just opened a drive-by testing center.MAYOR CARMEN YULÍN CRUZ: Yes that is correct. First of all I hope everybody’s safe and staying home as much as you can. It is important to break the cycle down and ensure that those that are most vulnerable are less in the line of fire so to speak. One of the things that we have been doing since January at the municipality is ensuring that we kept abreast of what was happening. So it gave us a little leeway to purchase masks for our first responders and for anyone that we knew — doctors and nurses — were going to be on the line of fire. It is very important that they have the equipment so that they don’t get sick and reduce the amount of doctors with coronavirus because you know if you lose your doctors and you lose your nurses and your lab technicians who’s going to take care of everybody? So we started working on that. As you know and you mentioned we started a curfew in Puerto Rico. The 9th of March we started taking measures in San Juan.On March 13th we signed a contract with Quest laboratories that provided us with an amount of tests the PCR. Those are the testing that it’s a swab that goes in your nostrils in both nostrils and it has a 95% effectiveness ratio. So we needed to have a way that would be fast and quick for people that have symptoms. That’s very important. Amy people have to have symptoms. Now there are of course vulnerable populations like people on dialysis or cancer patients or HIV patients which we are monitoring on a daily basis from what we called clínica vida which is — we call it our life clinic where our HIV adult and pediatrician patients we are calling them on a daily basis to see if they have any symptoms. So we have established let’s say a priority because we don’t have — as anybody else in the world we don’t have as many testing kits as we would like them to have. These tests are sent to California. It takes about four days after they get there which they get during one day. And we are already starting to receive results. In the case of San Juan only one person has been positive from our testing at the municipality. And of course we are sending those numbers to the state and to the CDC. It’s been very effective. We thought we were going to have 25 patients a day Monday Tuesday and Wednesday. Monday of this week was our first official day. On the —AMY GOODMAN: Yulín we have a bad connection but I want Juan to get one more question in before we move on. Juan?JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yes Mayor I wanted to ask you about the federal package that’s being crafted voted on hopefully today in Congress. Often the congressional bills either exempt Puerto Rico or reduce payments to Puerto Rico compared to other states. Do you have any sense yet of whether the proposals in the Senate and in this package will include for instance the $1200 payments to every American $500 for every dependent and also extended unemployment benefits whether those will apply to Puerto Rico as well?MAYOR CARMEN YULÍN CRUZ: We have been told that they would and we are currently checking on that. As you know the bill was approved yesterday. But one of the things that I think is evident is that with the Trump administration and FEMA we have to continue to remind them time and time again that we are people and that we deserve to be treated with the same sense of justice urgency and dignity as anybody else is. This past weekend FEMA exempted everybody from the Buy America First and they did not exempt Puerto Rico they did not exempt Washington D.C. and they did not exempt any of the other territories. And frankly we had to raise hell. And I want to thank Nydia Velázquez for being a very clear voice in that area and Bennie Thompson the congressman that chairs the Homeland Security Committee for being strong voices for the people of Puerto Rico. I just don’t know why one has to continue here in Puerto Rico and in the states to tell the Trump administration that people go before money and that this is about saving lives. It is not about politics.AMY GOODMAN: Carmen Yulín Cruz we thank you so much for being with us mayor of San Juan Puerto Rico. We hope to touch base with you soon with a clearer phone line.
291,Even in a Pandemic Andrew Cuomo Is Not Your Friend,AKASH MEHTA,Jacobin,-2,https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/andrew-cuomo-medicaid-coronavirus,Andrew Cuomo’s daily press conferences have made him the Democratic Party’s “most prominent voice in a time of crisis” as certified by the New York Times. Cuomo projects the competent and candid tell-it-like-it-is tough guy persona that millions of New Yorkers and Americans crave in a time of panic and uncertainty.He gives particular reassurance to those unnerved by the daily chaos of Trump’s press conferences a contrast he carefully cultivates: “I try to present unbiased facts. I try to present numbers because people need information. When you get anxious when you get fearful when you don’t get the information or you doubt the information or you think people do not know what they are talking about or you think you are getting lied to … so I present facts.”The message is clear. #PresidentCuomo as a trending hashtag dubbed him will give you the real facts where President Trump gives ‘alternative” ones; is even-keeled and trustworthy where Trump is mercurial and self-interested; knows what he’s talking about where Trump spouts misinformation and lies.It’s an effective public relations campaign — so effective that you could almost forget that this is Andrew Cuomo we’re talking about.Lest you thought he had turned a new leaf Governor 1 percent is insisting on taking an ax to the state Medicaid budget even at the cost of $6.7 billion in emergency federal aid — and lying about it. In the most unequal state in the nation he is fighting to protect the rich and impose austerity on everyone else. Make no mistake: even in a pandemic Andrew Cuomo is not your friend.The man who summarily disbanded the corruption commission he’d ran on creating when it began to investigate his allies. The man who made a host of videotaped promises in exchange for the Working Families Party’s endorsement only to turn around and break them all. The man who secretly worked for years to ensure Republican control of the State Senate protecting himself from the flak that would come with having to veto progressive legislation.And lest you thought he had turned a new leaf Governor 1 percent is insisting on taking an ax to the state Medicaid budget even at the cost of $6.7 billion in emergency federal aid — and lying about it. In the most unequal state in the nation he is fighting to protect the rich and impose austerity on everyone else. Make no mistake: even in a pandemic Andrew Cuomo is not your friend.Each of the half-dozen organizers and legislators I interviewed for this article acknowledged that aspects of Cuomo’s response to the crisis have been competent. But what’s lost in the rush to praise Cuomo is that he and his coronavirus task force (headed by former high-ups at MacAndrews and Forbes and the notorious Blackstone Group whose corporate ties would have barred them from government service had Cuomo not used his emergency powers to lift revolving-door laws) have shown callous indifference to needs of New York’s working-class and most vulnerable citizens.When asked how average New Yorkers can be expected to make rent amid coronavirus’s economic devastation Cuomo claims he “took care of the rent issue” — but he ignores rent-cancellation legislation that is currently supported by dozens of legislators. He uses the pandemic as cover to roll back last year’s bail reform laws that have reduced the state’s prison population by thousands. He not only uses $2/hour prison labor to rebottle hand sanitizer but also refuses to release elderly and sick inmates from filthy crowded jails like Rikers Island.And perhaps most scandalously of all he continues to push to meet a budget shortfall by enacting deep Medicaid cuts rather than passing wildly popular tax increases on the 0.01 percent — even though this would require him to turn down billions in federal coronavirus aid to the state.Last week even as New York became a global epicenter of the pandemic Cuomo’s “Medicaid Redesign Team” (MRT) released its proposals to cut $2.5 billion from the state Medicaid budget including $400 million to hospitals as they battle coronavirus in the next year. Cuomo justifies the cuts as reining in out-of-control Medicaid spending. But as Roosevelt Institute fellows J.W. Mason and Naomi Zwede note Medicaid spending is already under control; it’s been rising at the same rate as New York’s economy as a whole.Dick Gottfried the longest–serving New York legislator in history and the Chairman of Assembly’s Health Committee told me that “The MRT itself was what we knew it would be: a sham — theater to pretty up a bad package.” Its recommendations “are what we expected: a long list of proposals almost all of them unjustified and damaging cuts to virtually all forms of health care.”Gustavo Rivera Gottfried’s counterpart in the state senate offered a similar verdict: the MRT was an unrepresentative and opaque “dog-and-pony show from the beginning.” (Anyone who’s been upset in the last year at executive branch noncompliance with legislative oversight should see Cuomo administrators’ smirking stonewalling of Health Committee Chair Rivera’s basic questions at a January hearing on the Medicaid budget proposals.)What makes the cuts particularly perverse is that they come in the middle of a pandemic that is exposing the horrific consequences of underfunded health care in the state. Decades of cuts to New York’s health care services many of them championed by Cuomo have contributed to the present crisis.In a press conference responding to Cuomo’s budget proposals nurse Sarah Buckley recounted how even before the pandemic hospitals were “already cut to the bone” so short-staffed that patients often had to lie in their own waste for hours before a nurse was available to change their clothes.Now as Cuomo calls for retired health professionals to reenlist and orders hospitals to expand capacity by at least 50 percent that understaffing and the state’s elimination of 20000 hospital beds — which Cuomo has likely been the “single most important person” in bringing about according to Sean Petty of the New York State Nurses Association — are major limits on New York’s response to the pandemic. As Gottfried put it the cuts have meant that “at times like this and even in ‘normal’ times we don’t have the resources we need to keep people alive.”Councilman Brad Lander told me how his son who suffered from bronchiolitis as an infant once had to be put in an oxygen tent at the Long Island College Hospital a few blocks away. Now not only that oxygen tent not only that hospital bed not only the ventilator down the hall but that entire hospital no longer exists. With Cuomo’s support it was sold to real estate developers years ago.MRT’s proposed cuts rely heavily on increasing local governments’ contribution towards Medicaid expenditures. This is tantamount to cutting services Michael Kink of the Strong Economy for All Coalition told me. Cuomo has mandated that real property tax rates either decrease or remain flat each year. Counties can thus pay for extra costs only by increasing the sales tax (making poor people pay more for their groceries rather than billionaires for their yachts as Kink put it) or by cutting either health care or other public services — schools higher education homeless and housing programs transportation public sector jobs. If the cost-shifts go through Kink said all these services would see “savage cuts.”Albany on the other hand can easily generate new revenue to close the deficit without cutting a dollar in spending; Cuomo’s claim in Saturday’s press conference that “if I can’t change that [cutting Medicaid] we can’t do a budget” was patently false. In particular as the governor of the most unequal state in the country Cuomo could simply raise raises on the state’s wealthy.A coalition of advocacy groups and unions have rallied around the #MakeBillionairesPay agenda of fourteen different measures to tax wealthy New Yorkers including taxes on billionaire’s wealth stock buybacks stock transfers yachts and private jets (reversing Cuomo’s tax breaks on these last items). Passing just one or two of these measures could immediately close the budget gap. The whole package which has significant support in the legislature would provide upwards of $30 billion in new revenue. And the measures poll extremely well garnering the approval of over 90 percent of New York voters including 87 percent of Republicans and 91 percent of suburban and upstate voters.But Cuomo continues to press cuts to Medicaid and other services pandemic be damned rather than make billionaires pay. His choice is “incomprehensible to me and my coworkers” Buckley said “who pack up our clothes when we go to work knowing we might be there for sixteen or twenty-four hours that we might bring home viruses that could kill our family members or ourselves. We cannot imagine how Medicaid cuts are being considered right now rather than an extra tax on billionaires’ yachts and second homes.”Perhaps the explanation has something to do with the fact that over half of New York’s billionaires on last year’s Forbes 400 list have contributed to Cuomo’s campaigns.Governor 1 percent never fails to live up to his moniker even in a pandemic. What makes these cuts a new low even for him though is that he indicates he’ll go forward with them even at the cost of the $6.7 billion in federal aid.On March 18 Senator Chuck Schumer issued a triumphant press release claiming credit for the delivery of more than $6 billion of federal emergency funding to his home state more than any other state. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) he helped negotiate included a provision that increased the federal government’s contribution to Medicaid expenditures by 6.2 percent. New York usually contributed half of the cost but now only had to pay 43.8 percent saving it $6.7 billion.You’d think Cuomo who has repeatedly blasted the federal government for not directing enough coronavirus relief money to New York would eagerly claim the aid. But the FFCRA included a provision to prevent states from using the extra money to simply offset their own Medicaid expenditures. The aid comes on the condition that New York not cut Medicaid — exactly what Cuomo is so determined to do.And so at his first press conference Governor Cuomo told millions of viewers that “because of a technical issue [in] the way the bill was written New York State does not qualify for aid. That’s over $6 billion; that is a lot of money. And we need the federal delegation to fix that bill otherwise New York State gets nothing.”This was and remains a bald-faced lie. The supposed “technical issue” Cuomo referred to was in fact a deliberate provision to prevent state Medicaid cuts. New York does qualify for the money; all it would take to receive it would be to withdraw the MRT’s proposed cuts from the March 31 budget.And yet Cuomo indicated that he was unwilling to do so continuing to emphasize the need for Medicaid “reform” in the following days insisting on Thursday that “they never fixed that [Families First] bill” and ominously warning that “everyone is going to have to deal with the reality I can’t protect them from the reality.”Today he seemed to think emphatically repeating the lie would make it true: “The federal government gave us zero nada niente zilch” he declared leaving him no option but “to dramatically cut our state expenses” because “this is math: you can’t spend that which you don’t have.”He left unmentioned the possibility of raising taxes on the wealthy to meet the shortfall treating it as a given that New York’s sick and schoolchildren would shoulder the burden of the pandemic rather than its billionaires and bankers. And he willfully ignored the $6.7 billion of emergency federal aid knowing that to acknowledge and accept it would require holding off on his prized Medicaid cuts.Take a minute to appreciate just how cruel the course is that Cuomo’s taking. It would mean ramming through $2.5 billion in cuts to the health care system that millions of the hardest-hit New Yorkers are relying on to get them through the world’s worst health care crisis in a century while simultaneously depriving the same system of nearly $7 billion in federal aid. Even if he ultimately caves to pressure from advocates and legislators to postpone the Medicaid cuts and take the federal money the fact that he was prepared to go this route — and that he’ll likely make deep cuts to education spending regardless — should open the eyes of even his most smitten admirers.Activists in New York have our task set out for us. We must pressure Cuomo to accept the emergency federal Medicaid funding. We must demand that he make billionaires pay in the March 31 budget rather than cutting Medicaid schools or other critical services. We must redouble our efforts to pass the single-payer New York Health Act replacing the profit-driven health care system exacerbating every aspect of the coronavirus crisis.And we must remind a nation yearning for a strong capable trustworthy leader that when the cameras stop rolling Andrew Cuomo is not on our side.
292,We Can’t Return to Capitalism as Usual After This Crisis,ABI WILKINSON,Jacobin,-2,https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/coronavirus-covid-19-capitalism-crisis-herd-immunity,Over the past few weeks the UK strategy on COVID-19 has veered dramatically from contrarian laissez-faire to hasty panicked adoption of social control measures similar to those in other European countries. An endless stream of British journalists implored us initially to simply trust our government’s favored experts (and implicitly to ignore the suspiciously foreign advice of most other epidemiologists including those employed by the World Health Organization).This stance became increasingly hard to defend after it emerged that the government’s initial strategy — allowing the virus to infect the young and healthy in the hope of building “herd immunity” that would protect vulnerable groups — was at least partly based on faulty modeling. Specifically scientists advising the government had used data for a different disease with a much lower hospitalization rate than had been observed in countries hit earlier by COVID-19.Pro-government commentators quickly divided into two camps with the first adopting a position that’s almost too absurd to engage with seriously. They claimed that nothing about the government’s approach had actually changed the public had simply failed to understand it properly.That footage you watched of the UK’s chief scientific adviser explaining why “herd immunity” through widespread infection was a desirable goal? Those words didn’t actually mean what you thought they did. The Newsnight segment where a Public Health England official told us to see our elderly relatives go to the pub and generally carry on as usual if we didn’t have symptoms despite the evidence globally of asymptomatic transmission? It simply never happened. Who are you going to trust your lying eyes or the 2017 winner of the Political Commentator of the Year award?The second group attempted a more subtle defensive maneuver. Rather than informing us Ministry of Truth–style of the absolute infallibility of the government response they asked us to trust the good intentions of the people in charge. Under the headline “Our politicians are only trying to do their best” the Spectator’s Alex Massie opined that the pandemic “is a time for generosity and kindness; a moment for the cutting of slack and the making of allowances.” A sentiment that seems unobjectionable in the abstract but rather misses the point when it comes to assessing the actions of political leaders during a crisis.I do not care whether Boris Johnson means well. Nor am I interested in the purity of Matt Hancock’s heart. Frankly I do not claim to be able to judge whether Rishi Sunak is trying his absolute hardest or whether he could be going at it with a bit more welly. I imagine they all believe themselves to be good people doing as best they can in difficult circumstances. That seems to be true of most politicians.Indeed it’s true of most people in most walks of life. In situations like this where our leaders appear to have made a whole series of gravely suboptimal decisions — risking hundreds of thousands of lives in the process — asking “incompetence or malice?” obscures far more than it reveals.A foundational myth of technocracy is the existence of a single set of desirable political goals. It imagines some unified “public good” that people in power will generally aim to maximize even if they use different tools and strategies to do so. According to this logic political decisions cannot be morally right or wrong only effective or ineffective.An estimated 130000 preventable deaths due to austerity are simply a regrettable unintended consequence of David Cameron and George Osborne’s attempt to do what they believed was right. The “incompetence or malice” binary posits only one unlikely seeming possible alternative: that killing people was a deliberate policy goal.I have no doubt that all things being equal Boris Johnson would like to minimize the number of deaths from COVID-19. The pertinent question is not whether the UK government has this aim at all but the extent to which they prioritize it over other competing concerns.While some have attempted to argue that a recession could result in more loss of life than the virus (relying on the dubious assumption that government cannot prevent people dying prematurely due to poverty) it’s generally been understood that there is a direct trade-off between economic growth and saving lives.In the United States Republicans have made the issue explicit. Texas lieutenant governor Dan Patrick went as far as to suggest that “lots of grandparents” would prefer to risk their survival than see the United States adopt public health measures that further damage the national economy. Though Donald Trump has not stated the apparent trade-off in quite such stark language he’s repeatedly pushed for Americans to return to work just when epidemiologists expect the pandemic to hit its peak saying that “the cure cannot be worse than the problem.”As is often the case with Trump this seems less a deviation from conventional elite opinion than an example of him saying the quiet part loud. Though no UK politician has dared to say similar publicly a recent Sunday Times article said that government adviser Dominic Cummings outlined the government’s original strategy as according to one observer’s summation: “protect the economy and if that means some pensioners die too bad.”The notion that it might be justifiable to sacrifice human lives in service of “the economy” only makes sense if you conceive of economic growth having some independent intrinsic value beyond promoting human well-being. In reality this euphemistic language serves to obscure the truth: that the people who are sacrificed are predominately poor and the people who benefit from a buoyant stock market are the rich.Though viruses do not discriminate based on class working-class people are significantly more likely to have jobs that cannot be done remotely. The individuals who are urging that we “carry on as normal” likely have far more ability to take measures to protect themselves and their families.In the case of the UK it seems likely that ideological priors also influenced decision-making in more subtle ways. Anyone paying attention knows that the NHS consistently operates at close to full capacity to the extent that even regular seasonal flu can send hospitals into crisis. This state of affairs is the result of a decade of underfunding by the Conservatives rationalized as the pursuit of “efficiency.”You don’t need to be an epidemiologist or even to have studied the numbers closely to wonder why the government ever believed it could deal with the sharp spike in demand expected under a minimalist strategy. Bad modeling notwithstanding there was ample evidence from other countries that hospitals were struggling to cope.I can only assume that those in government who backed the “herd immunity” strategy desperately wanted to believe an easy non-economically disruptive option was available. The alternative — that a significant increase in government spending was going to be necessary and that systematically cutting public services to the bone has disastrous consequences — presents a significant challenge to the Conservative worldview.All of us tend to be less skeptical of ideas that align with our existing beliefs about how the world works and how things should be done. It’s unsurprising then that many jumped at the prospect of a laissez-faire solution. The idea that other countries (and the World Health Organization) had gotten it wrong and that more interventionist approaches would ultimately be futile must have been highly seductive. One anonymous senior figure even briefed journalists that measures taken in Italy were “populist non-science-based measures that aren’t any use.” In reality going into lockdown seems to have significantly slowed the rate of infection.Eventually the current crisis will pass but it will be a huge mistake if we attempt to return to “normal.” The issues we’ve been forced to confront have lasting implications. Namely if foundational economic principles must be abandoned when things get tough does this system really serve our needs? If rapid radical change is possible when circumstances demand it what excuse is there for failing to act with similar urgency to prevent cataclysmic climate change? What can and should we do differently now that we know doing things differently is possible?
293,This Crisis Has Exposed the Absurdities of Neoliberalism. That Doesn’t Mean It’ll Destroy It,COSTAS LAPAVITSAS,Jacobin,-2,https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/coronavirus-pandemic-great-recession-neoliberalism,The COVID-19 public health emergency has rapidly turned into a crisis at the core of the world economy which also threatens developing countries in the periphery. It has changed the balance between state and market once again exposing the emptiness of neoliberal ideology. This economic crisis casts a harsh light on contemporary capitalism — and is likely to prove even more important than the blow to public health.Indeed this crisis has deeper roots in the diseased workings of financialized and globalized capitalism over the past decade. The Great Crisis of 2007–9 brought an end to the 1990s-2000s “golden era” of finance and the years that followed were marked by poor growth at the core of the world economy. Profitability was weak productivity growth was low and investment showed no dynamism at all. Finance was also in trouble exhibiting lower profitability and none of the extraordinary dynamism of the previous decade. Where the historically unprecedented crisis of 2007–9 marked the peak of financialization the equally novel coronavirus crisis crystallizes its deterioration.Of course the immediate spur for the crisis owed to nation-states’ actions faced with the epidemic. Having initially ignored the medical emergency several states then frantically locked down entire countries and geographical areas restricting travel closing schools and universities and so on. This hit hard the already weakened core economies by inducing a wholesale collapse of demand disruption of supply chains falling production millions of worker layoffs and loss of corporate revenue. All this spurred an unprecedented nosedive of major stock markets and panic conditions in the money markets.It is as if the Black Death of the fourteenth century had staged a return and twenty-first century societies responded with a similar mix of blind fear and isolation of communities. Yet the plague killed a third of Europe’s population back when its states were poor and backward feudal monarchies. In contrast the coronavirus appears to have a low mortality rate and has struck advanced capitalist states of peerless technological accomplishments. There is already an intense debate among epidemiologists on whether wholesale lockdown was an appropriate and sustainable response or if states should instead have focused on intensive testing of the population.It is not for political economists to assess epidemiological policies. But there is little doubt that several states’ reactions and the ensuing collapse of economic activity are of a piece with the fundamentally flawed nature of neoliberal financialized capitalism. An economic system based on competition and naked profit-seeking — both guaranteed by a powerful state — proved incapable of dealing calmly and effectively with a public health shock of unknown severity.Several advanced countries lacked the basic health infrastructure to treat those who became seriously ill while also being short of equipment to test the population on a large scale and to protect those most likely to catch the disease. The lockdown and wholesale isolation of huge sections of society are moreover likely to have very severe implications for wage workers as well as the poorest the weakest and the most marginal layers. The mental and psychological repercussions will also be devastating. The social organization of contemporary capitalism was shown to be dysfunctional even from an engineering point of view.Equally striking however have been even powerful states’ actions after the magnitude of the unfolding economic collapse became clear. In March the central banks of the United States the European Union and Japan engaged in massive liquidity injections and brought interest rates down to zero attempting to stabilize stock markets and assuage the shortage of liquidity. The US Federal Reserve for instance announced that it would buy unlimited volumes of government bonds and even freshly issued private corporate bonds. Governments in the United States the European Union and elsewhere meanwhile planned massive fiscal expansions taking the form of loan and credit guarantees for companies income subsidies for affected workers tax deferrals social security deferrals or subsidies debt repayment holidays and so on.In an extraordinary move the Trump administration announced plans to provide $1200 per adult or $2400 per couple with additional payments for children starting with the poorest families. This disbursement was part of a package which could exceed $2 trillion — roughly 10 percent of US GDP — further providing $500 billion of loans to stricken businesses $150 billion to hospitals and health care workers and $370 billion of loans and grants to small and medium enterprises. In an equally extraordinary move Britain’s Tory government declared its intention effectively to become the employer of last resort by paying up to 80 percent of workers’ salaries if companies kept them on their payroll. These payments would be worth up to a maximum of £2500 per month — just above the median income. Not content with this the British government also effectively nationalized the railways for six months and there was talk of nationalizing airlines.Just days earlier even left-wing academics would have considered these measures to be radical. The shibboleths of the neoliberal ideology of the last four decades were rapidly swept aside and the state emerged as the regulator of the economy commanding enormous power. It was not difficult for many on the Left to welcome such state action thinking that it indicated the “return of Keynesianism” and the death knell of neoliberalism. But it would be rash to come to such conclusions.For one thing the nation-state has always been at the heart of neoliberal capitalism guaranteeing the class rule of the dominant corporate and financial bloc through selective interventions at critical moments. Moreover these interventions were accompanied by strongly authoritarian measures shutting people inside their homes en masse and locking down enormous metropoles. The state has also demonstrated its vast power to police society by collecting information through big data. For instance Israel’s right-wing government approved the tracking of cell phones by the security police with the aim of messaging people who had unwittingly come into contact with confirmed coronavirus patients. Not only do we know where you are but we know better than you whom you have met.This authoritarianism is fully in line with the dominant neoliberal ideology of the last four decades. State fiat is combined with the fragmentation of society as people are shut in their own homes and huge stress is placed on the “individual responsibility” to maintain social distancing. At the same time large numbers of people are still required to go to work using public transport while working rights are demolished not least as layoffs rocket without concern for due process and as remote working destroys all limits to the working week.It thus remains unclear what direction global capitalism will take as it reels under the shock of coronavirus — even as we still endure the long aftermath of the Great Crisis of 2007–9. The colossal power of the state and its ability to intervene in both economy and society could result for instance in a more authoritarian form of controlled capitalism in which the interests of the corporate and financial elite would be paramount. This demands that socialists assess carefully and critically the actions that states are taking to deal with the coronavirus crisis.The Crisis So FarThe first step is to have a simple analytical summary of the course of the crisis so far. Crises are always highly concrete historical events reflecting the institutional development of capitalism. The major steps in the coronavirus crisis can be gleaned from a raft of (sometimes rapidly outdated) publications by multilateral organizations the press and elsewhere. Thus:COVID-19 emerged in China in late 2019 but the response of the Chinese state was initially slow which could perhaps be ascribed to lack of knowledge about the severity of the virus. However other states were slow to respond even after the full eruption of the epidemic in China. Until early March 2020 for instance the number of daily confirmed cases in the United Kingdom was in the low double digits. Yet even with the Chinese experience to draw on the UK government did next to nothing.Eventually the Chinese state locked down huge areas of the country and other states followed with their own lockdowns restricting the movement of hundreds of millions of people. Demand for tourism air travel hospitality restaurants and pubs collapsed totally. Demand for food clothing household goods and so on was also significantly affected although the overall impact is still unclear. The uncertainty created by the retreat of consumption inevitably hit investment plans but again it is impossible to assess the overall impact at this early stage.The lockdown and the restricted movement of workers severely disrupted supply chains initially in China which provides a large volume of production inputs across the world and then in other parts of Asia Europe and the United States. Together with the blow to demand this led to the curtailing of production.Falling production shrinking demand and growing uncertainty destroyed company revenues. A wave of bankruptcies loomed. The jobs of millions of workers came under threat especially in the service sector and millions were laid off in March. Loss of employment worsened consumption and further undermined production. As revenues declined enterprises became less able to pay their debts trade credit vanished and by mid-March liquidity (that is hard cash) was at a premium. The crisis acquired a severe credit dimension further compounding the effect on production and output.A taste of the potential economic devastation can be gained from China. According to official statistics value added in production in January and February dropped by 13.5 percent compared to the same period in 2019 (manufacturing declining by 15.7 percent). Moreover investment exports and imports fell by respectively 24.5 15.9 and 2.4 percent. The Chinese contraction alone would have had a severe impact on the world economy. With many other core countries in effective lockdown the fallout will be huge particularly in sectors like airlines and tourism.The repercussions on working people will be shattering. Especially vulnerable are the sections weakened by years of neoliberal policies for instance those on flexible contracts informal workers and the self-employed. Also vulnerable are highly indebted workers (or those with no savings) who have limited access to benefits and public services. Women will probably be affected worse because they are overrepresented in those groups but also because of the increased care work that comes with health distress children not going to school and so on.Global conditions worsened further as the crisis triggered a gigantic stock-market collapse. For years the main stock markets across the world had been greatly inflated and the risk of a severe crisis became apparent already in 2018. The coronavirus shock led to a spectacular fall of more than one-third from February to March. The result was a dramatic tightening of liquidity that spurred a money-market crisis in the United States the center of world finance by mid-March. The shock had morphed into a full-blown capitalist crisis.As fear gripped world markets the flow of capital across borders especially from the core to the periphery of the world economy was also affected. Existing evidence does not allow for firm conclusions but there is a distinct possibility of a “sudden stop” that would make developing countries unable to pay for imports and service debts thus raising the prospect of currency crises. Amidst the turmoil an unfolding price war among oil producers brought the price of Brent crude down by roughly 50 percent from late February to late March. This gigantic fall directly threatened the viability of a raft of producers across the world including in the US fracking industry.This chain of crisis phenomena makes analytical sense only within the aftermath of the Great Crisis of 2007–9. In the wake of that crisis financialized capitalism lost dynamism in core countries though it continued in subordinate form in developing countries. Our estimates based on World Bank data suggest that average growth rates in 2010–19 were at their lowest for forty years: 1.4 percent in Japan 1.8 percent in the European Union 2.5 percent in the United States and 8.5 percent in China (where growth weakened strikingly in the second half of the decade). These rates point to the exhaustion of the driving forces of capitalist accumulation particularly during the last decade. To gain insight into the deeper roots of the crisis therefore it suffices to consider some key aspects of the performance of the US economy — the mother lode of globalization and financialization.Weak AccumulationThe simplest way to sum up the underlying performance of US capitalism is to consider the profit rate of nonfinancial enterprises shown in Figure 1:Fig. 1   Profit rate of nonfinancial enterprises US 1980–2018Source: Author calculations; BEA NIPA data.The trajectory of the profit rate was strongly cyclical and broadly in line with the overall fluctuations of the US economy. After the Great Crisis of 2007–9 the profit rate recovered weakly peaking in 2014 and then declining. Clearly the coronavirus shock hit the US economy at a time when it was already weak and accumulation showed signs of exhaustion. The underlying weakness is also apparent from a variety of other data. Thus after 2007–9 labor productivity grew at barely 1 percent per annum; investment remained flat and low at around 18 percent of GDP; and the real capital stock shrunk.Instructive here is a comparison with China the world’s second-largest economy. After the 2007–9 crisis the estimated average profit rate in China rose for several years but began to decline in 2014. The underlying weakness of accumulation also appears in other data though China’s performance remained substantially stronger than that of the United States. Thus after 2007–9 labor productivity rose at around 7–8 percent per annum investment was broadly flat at 45 percent of GDP and industrial-capacity utilization fell rapidly. The coronavirus hit the Chinese economy at one of its weakest moments since the start of its capitalist transformation.Comparison with the European Union which is collectively larger than China but smaller than the United States adds further insight. After 2007–9 productivity growth was worse than in the United States particularly for states in the European Monetary Union (EMU) with the leading countries hovering below 1 percent per annum (Poland which is not in the EMU stood out with productivity growth above 3 percent). Industrial production increased substantially in Germany despite its weak productivity growth as capitalists continued to take advantage of the competitive edge gained from a long period of wage suppression. However in 2019 it fell revealing Germany’s underlying weakness.The European Union weighed down by the austerity framework of the euro was lodged in stagnation during the last decade. During the same period a new industrial complex began to emerge in Eastern Europe as in Poland closely associated with German industry. The labor share of GDP remained stagnant as capital defended its interests except for Germany where wage growth was significant for the first time in decades. Given the absence of sustained productivity growth German competitiveness declined. All in all coronavirus has thus hit the European Union at a time of great economic weakness.The roots of the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus lie in the weakening of capitalist accumulation in the preceding period which is evident in the United States China and the European Union. The impact of the crisis will moreover probably be very different in these economies because of their different structures. China has become the workshop of the world with value added in manufacturing accounting for roughly 30 percent of GDP — the corresponding figure for the United States is just over 10 percent. Value added in services has risen substantially in China as the economy has become more mature but it is still only at 50 percent of GDP while in the United States it is above 75 percent. Since the shock of the lockdown falls disproportionately on services it is likely that the United States will be worse affected than China at least in the first instance.The same holds broadly for the European Union whose economy is heavily based on services particularly in southern-periphery countries like Spain Portugal and Greece which have weak industry and are dependent on tourism. The shock will probably be even greater for Italy which has been stagnant for two decades and since 2010 never far from defaulting on its debt. The EU leadership are thus right to perceive the coronavirus crisis as an existential threat. That is the reason for the European Central Bank’s (ECB) massive intervention but also the actions of several nation-states whose crisis expenditure has in practice lifted the iron cage of austerity over Europe.The Travails of FinanceThe weakness of financialized capitalism in the United States can be further gauged by considering the profit rate of US commercial banks in Fig. 2:Fig. 2 Rate of profit of commercial banks (return on equity) US 1980–2018Source: Author calculations; FDIC data.The profitability of US commercial banks — the pivot of the financial system — reached historic highs from the early 1990s until shortly before the crisis of 2007–9. This was the “golden era” of US financialization. Two factors explain the banks’ exceptional profits: first their ability to secure a sizeable spread between the interest rate on loans and the interest rate on deposits and second their ability to earn large fees and commissions by mediating financial transactions among enterprises households and other financial firms. After 2007–9 bank profitability never reached the same heights. This was because the Federal Reserve drove interest rates close to zero thus compressing bank spreads and also because income from fees and comissions declined as the volume of financial transactions declined. Bank profitability had a brief spurt in 2018 but that was mostly due to the Federal Reserve gently raising interest rates in 2017–8.Further light can be cast on the decade after 2007–9 by considering the trajectory of debt in the United States in Fig. 3 split into the debt of i) nonfinancial enterprises ii) households iii) government and iv) domestic financial enterprises all relative to GDP:Fig. 3 US Sectoral Debt to GDPSource: Author calculations; St Louis FRED data.US private debt (in proportion to GDP) fell after 2007–9 contrary to much breathless commentary about a “debt explosion.” Mortgage debt declined substantially as households were badly hit during the Great Crisis. Debt among domestic financial enterprises also declined thus leaving less scope for banks to earn fees and commissions. In contrast the debt of nonfinancial corporations began to rise in 2015 eventually exceeding its previous peak before the Great Crisis. The rise in corporate debt has facilitated the survival of a multitude of weak enterprises with low profitability which are very vulnerable to shocks. These “zombie firms” were estimated in 2017 to represent 12 percent of all companies in fourteen developed economies. It remains to be seen how the coronavirus crisis will affect their ability to service their debts bearing in mind that zero interest rates bring down servicing costs.The real increase during this period however was in state debt leaving the US government more indebted than at any time since World War II. Financialization after the Great Crisis insofar as it showed any dynamism at all became a process of exploding state indebtedness that was also connected to enterprise indebtedness in open financial markets — including the stock market.This article relies on some of the work of the research team established by EReNSEP-Ekona to examine the longer-term implications of the current crisis.

294,Corona: The Inequality Virus,COLIN GORDON,Jacobin,-2,https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/coronavirus-inequality-covid-19-work-education-health-disparities-poverty,The Trump administration’s predictable mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic and the scattershot congressional response both underscore and distract us from a larger problem: the policies and institutions that we count on to provide some semblance of economic security are fundamentally broken.The last few weeks have laid bare the stunning flaws of the American health-care system and public health infrastructure. They have reminded us how deeply we rely on basic public goods and services. They have demonstrated — in dramatic and terrifying ways — the fragility the fragmentation and the sheer inadequacy of the US welfare state.And they have shown that the costs of this economic and social disaster will be borne unevenly. “In societies where the virus hits” the New York Times noted earlier this month “it is deepening the consequences of inequality pushing many of the burdens onto the losers of today’s polarized economies and labor markets.” Nowhere is that more true than in the United States.HealthThe core inequality in our health-care system — that some are insured and some are not — makes it harder to stem the coronavirus contagion dramatically raises the costs of any intervention and ensures that the most susceptible are the least likely to get the care they need.Every economic downturn exposes the folly of the United States’ employment-based private health insurance system which throws millions off their insurance coverage the moment they lose their jobs. Those consequences are even more pronounced in a recession accompanied (or precipitated) by a public health crisis.Our crazy-quilt health-care system not only offers uneven coverage but squanders about a third of its resources (or up to a trillion dollars a year) to administer the distinction between the insured the uninsured and the underinsured. Let that sink in: the annual waste in our health system carries about the same price tag as the federal government’s first-round response to the COVID-19 crisis.For those without job-based coverage the Affordable Care Act and Medicaid expansion extend some peace of mind and many states are considering bolstering these options. But the gaps remain wide. Fifteen states nine of them in the South still have not expanded Medicaid. So while the national uninsurance rate stands at about 10 percent most of the uninsured are low-income working adults almost half of them workers of color in non-expansion states (see Figure 1). In other words it is precisely those hardest hit by the coronavirus-induced collapse of the service economy that lack reliable access to health care.Figure 1: Rates of Uninsurance 2018. Source: Kaiser Family Foundation analysis of ACS 2018.The COVID-19 threat is exacerbated by persistent disparities in health access and health outcomes. While most acute in the non-expansion states they are by no means confined to the South. And inequality quite simply breeds vulnerability. One’s well-being is shaped not just by access to reliable care but by a broad array of social determinants including healthy food clean water recreation functional neighborhoods and safe streets. Low-income workers are far more likely to suffer from preexisting conditions — such as respiratory illness — that amplify the risk of any public health crisis. And these risks are compounded — think of the impact of the last heat wave — by social isolation and the paucity of neighborhood services.SchoolsThe shuttering of basic public goods and services — especially schools — also threatens to deepen inequality stemming from the crisis.American public schooling has reliably held out the promise of ameliorating background social and economic disparities and just as reliably fallen short of that goal. The culprits here are familiar: a long history of school segregation (before and after the 1954 Brown v Board of Education decision) a reliance on local revenue that means struggling neighborhoods are served by struggling schools and the dramatically localized exercise of policy and discretion within schools and districts that distribute opportunities (such as advanced placement classes) and punitive measures (school suspensions) in starkly unequal ways.Despite these shortcomings public schools are critically important to working-class children and families. They provide not just educational opportunities but essential social supports: before- and after-school programs school-based health clinics mental health services and emotional supports and a reliable source of nutritious food. Indeed the first priority in many districts as school buildings began to close was not how to maintain instruction but how to maintain access to school-based meals.That’s not to say the interruption in instruction won’t be felt differently in tony suburbs than in working-class neighborhoods. In some places including Philadelphia and Seattle K-12 school districts have directed teachers not to move to online classes citing uneven access to computers and broadband internet. Well-heeled districts meanwhile are sending students home with laptops or tablets and setting up Google classrooms.Assuming that conventional K-12 instruction is on hold until at least the fall there’s also the danger of an unequal summer slide (the academic ground lost from the end of one grade to the start of the next): In the summer following third grade students fail to retain between 20 and 25 percent of their school-year advances in reading and math; in the summer after seventh grade students drop between a third and a half of what they’ve gained. The impact of course varies considerably by socioeconomic status. Low-income children and their families have less capacity and opportunity to engage in out-of-school enrichment activities. And that chasm — driven largely by increased spending by high-income parents — has exploded over the last generation (see Figure 2). The absence of public schooling burdens low-income families more in the short run and it widens the opportunity gap in the long run.Figure 2: Annual Enrichment Expenditures on Children 1972–2006. Source: Greg J. Duncan and Richard J. Murnane. “Introduction: The American Dream Then and Now” in Whither Opportunity? ed. Greg Duncan and Richard Murnane (New York: Russell Sage 2011).WorkRecessions always bear hardest on working families. Inequality widens because the economy sheds low-wage and marginal workers at higher rates because barely a quarter of those laid off will ever see an unemployment check because many states have dramatically pared back both the size and duration of unemployment benefits and because widespread joblessness undermines bargaining power and wage growth for those who do stay employed.The COVID-19 recession put all of that on steroids. This is not a slow contraction — it is a shutdown. The job losses are already staggering. In the first week of the COVID-19 recession to cite but one example initial weekly unemployment claims in Ohio skyrocketed from 7051 a week to 78000; new claims this week pushed past 3 million nationally — almost five times the previous weekly peak set in 1982. National job losses by summer estimated at 14 million will push the unemployment rate well above that seen in the depths of the Great Recession. And to make matters worse as Josh Bivens of the Economic Policy Institute notes this recession is “laser-targeted at low-wage low-productivity and low-hours jobs in service industries.”Figure 3: Weekly Unemployment Insurance Claims 1967–2020. Source: Department of Labor Office of Unemployment Insurance Weekly Claims ReportService workers bear the burden of this recession in multiple ways: for one they cannot work from home – a luxury enjoyed by two-thirds of workers in the top quarter of the earning distribution but by fewer than one in ten in the bottom quarter. (A third of all white workers can clock in from home but only one in five African-American workers and one in six Latino workers have that option.) This also means they face a much greater risk of unemployment as the service economy shuts down — and a heightened risk of exposure to the virus if they keep working.More broadly the collapse of stable employment — and the scramble to patch together a response — exposes the ragged weakness of our safety net. The problem here is threefold: first a generation of devolution in social policy has vested discretion and responsibility in state and local governments that lack the interest or capacity to respond to routine needs let alone a crisis of this magnitude. As a result the response to the COVID-19 crisis has been uneven and fragmented and local and state governments (hamstrung by limited taxing capacity and balanced budget requirements) are at the mercy of federal aid.Second our social policies have dramatically narrowed the definition of the “deserving” poor in such a way that work or parenthood or both are prerequisites for state assistance. These are the baseline assumptions that leave so many slammed by the incipient recession (part-timers the self-employed gig workers) without anything to fall back on. And these are the baseline assumptions that in the last GOP version of the congressional stimulus would have excluded the poorest Americans (those without a tax bill to credit) from direct relief.Finally when pressed to look beyond these constraints and limits the political class’s policy response has been to cobble together piecemeal and temporary fixes — an extension of existing programs an easing of eligibility thresholds a run of one-time payments or tax breaks — rather than acknowledging that the core programs themselves are woefully inadequate to the task.What to DoThe task ahead is daunting in part because the trajectory and duration of the pandemic is still unknown and in part because our policy capacity and infrastructure — even in these early weeks — is so clearly lacking. To meet this crisis both effectively and equitably we need a short game and a long game. We must of course slow the spread of the virus — not just for public health reasons but to buy some time to develop the novel policy responses needed to attack this crisis and prepare for the next one.In the short run we also need courageous and expansive federal action — buttressing consumption backfilling state budgets propping up key economic sectors and assuming a wide array of economic risks. We need something at least on the order of the New Deal with massive investments in public goods at the local state and national level.The relief and recovery measures of the mid-1930s were quickly dwarfed by the progressive gains — collective bargaining rights social insurance robust financial regulation progressive taxation — that sustained security beyond the horizons of the immediate crisis. By the same token the real measure of our COVID-19 response will be in the long run — whether we emerge with equitable and universal access to health care paid sick and family leave expansive and generous social insurance programs and well-funded public goods and services.If COVID-19 is the inequality virus we must attack it as such.
295,The Last Thing We Need Is a Military Shock Doctrine,SARAH LAZARE,Jacobin,-2,https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/coronavirus-pandemic-united-states-military-repression,On March 18 New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio went on CNN and pleaded for President Trump to mobilize the US military in response to coronavirus. “I want their medical teams which are first-rate I want their logistical support I want their ability to get stuff from factories all over the country where they’re needed most” de Blasio told Anderson Cooper. “The only force in America that can do it effectively and quickly is the United States military.”The next day March 19 was the seventeenth anniversary of the US invasion of Iraq a catastrophic act of aggression that would go on to kill more than 1 million Iraqi people according to one estimate. Since 2003 that date has often been marked by anti-war protests street blockades and demonstrations at military installations but these actions have declined in frequency and scale as the years have passed and on Thursday — in quarantine — that anniversary went largely unremarked.But it needs to be remembered. As political leaders on both sides of the aisle fail to create an emergency response that can provide immediate material relief for the millions of people desperately in need we are seeing increasing calls to turn to the US military and National Guard to fill in that gap. The desperation driving this trend is understandable but we must not uncritically turn to military institutions as providers of “medical teams” and “logistical support” without looking at how the US military itself is a purveyor of unconscionable violence from its 2003 invasion of Iraq to its worsening of the present-day global pandemic or how it could be used to crack down on people within the United States.This is especially urgent as politicians move rapidly to pursue a military response. On Sunday night President Trump gave orders to activate the National Guard in New York California and Washington into federalized status which means they will be paid for by the federal government but under the control of states. And Military Times reports that all fifty states Puerto Rico Guam the US Virgin Islands and Washington DC “have each mobilized components of their Army and Air National Guard to assist in their state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic.” While the National Guard is a domestic force it can be mobilized in times of war and national emergency and it falls under the purview of the Department of Defense. Meanwhile according to Newsweek “the U.S. military is preparing forces to assume a larger role in the coronavirus response including the controversial mission of quelling ‘civil disturbances’ and enforcing the law.”There are already signs that governments around the world are using the crisis to expand the security state. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu is using the crisis to side-step legislative oversight and an upcoming trial for corruption to enact sweeping “security” measures. Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán is also using the crisis to seize dramatic powers that allow him to criminalize the press under the name of protecting security. We should be wary of similar maneuvers in the United States.The Military’s Role in the Global CrisisIf our concern were providing immediate relief and support for all people harmed and threatened by the coronavirus outbreak regardless of national origin or residence a good step would be to stop the US military from perpetrating the harm it’s presently inflicting against people who are highly vulnerable to the outbreak. Five years of a US-Saudi war and blockade on Yemen has left that country’s medical system decimated: The groups Physicians for Human Rights and the Yemen-based Mwatana for Human Rights have documented 120 attacks on medical facilities from March 2015 to the end of 2018 alone leaving the country highly vulnerable to the virus. Why are calls for an immediate end to US participation in that war not considered a high-priority emergency response?When we fortify the military we also reinforce the larger imperial apparatus it is part of. The Trump administration is acting on behalf of this imperial apparatus to tighten US sanctions on Iran in the midst of a global pandemic despite warnings that they are cutting off needed medical supplies and increasing coronavirus deaths. Iran is one of the countries hardest hit by this pandemic. Why isn’t ending these sanctions just two-and-a-half months after the Trump administration assassinated Maj. Gen. Qassim Soleimani and almost drew Iran into direct war considered a top priority in the fight against coronavirus?US military aid is enabling Israel’s fourteen-year economic and military siege of Gaza one of the most densely populated places in the world where there are now officially two confirmed cases of coronavirus. With a population of 2 million people Gaza has only sixty-two ventilators. Why isn’t it considered a top priority for the United States to withdraw its military aid from the siege so that life-saving medicines and supplies can get through?In Venezuela where there are forty-two confirmed cases of coronavirus US sanctions have helped push the country’s medical system to ruin and are estimated to have killed 40000 people from 2017 to 2018 in part by helping erode public health according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Where is the urgency around lifting those sanctions?It is no mystery what is going to happen to the people living in these places if the United States doesn’t act immediately to relieve the tremendous harm it is causing. While there are no confirmed cases in Yemen yet Altaf Musani Yemen’s World Health Organization representative said last week “It is a perfect storm of a disaster should this virus introduce itself.” The same goes for all places where health systems and social safety nets are battered and weakened by US war occupation proxy battle and aerial bombardments. By failing to take immediate steps to stop the harm it is doing in the midst of a global pandemic the United States will bear responsibility for these deaths. Yet somehow this harm never factors into the domestic conversation about a military response to a crisis even though in a global pandemic an outbreak in any one of these places impacts the whole world.Not a Public Health OrganizationDiscussions of the US military in the context of a crisis only ever go in one direction: pouring more resources into the Pentagon. Understandably people are desperate and there is a dearth of large-scale institutions capable of converting abandoned buildings into hospitals or quickly distributing tests medical supplies and food — acts that will be necessary to dealing with the coming deluge of coronavirus patients. Mayors and governors may very well feel that they have nowhere else to turn but the military — a profound failure of our political system.But the US military is not a public health organization: It is a purveyor of wars occupation and proxy battles with 800 military bases around the world. We have every reason to think it would be a ferocious force policing the streets of the United States prone to punitive responses at a time people desperately need food and rent money. When the National Guard was deployed to New Orleans in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina it took on a largely punitive law enforcement role. As the New York Times reported on September 9 2005 “New Orleans has turned into an armed camp patrolled by thousands of local state and federal law enforcement officers as well as National Guard troops and active-duty soldiers.”On March 17 California governor Gavin Newsom publicly floated the possibility of imposing martial law a statement he later walked back. Meanwhile according to Politico the Department of Justice is seeking emergency powers to detain people indefinitely without trial citing the coronavirus crisis. The possibility that we are on the verge of expanding government powers to detain and police people domestically has troubling echoes of the post-9/11 era which saw politicians on both sides of the aisle ram through the repressive and sweeping Patriot Act.Anti-war organizers are already grappling with the questions that a supposedly “humanitarian role” for the military raises particularly given the US history of declaring a humanitarian mission to justify brutal wars. In a statement written for the anti-militarist organization About Face: Veterans Against War activist and writer Drake Logan argues that during the outbreak “We need to draw careful lines between what is acceptable military response and what is categorically unacceptable.” Logan writes:What would be categorically unacceptable to communities in the U.S. is for soldiers to have their weapons and war-grade Kevlar—as well as other battlefield gear—out on our streets… We already have a highly militarized domestic police force which fills our streets with weaponry and which daily kills innocent Americans who never have a chance to be innocent until proven guilty. We cannot afford more of the same from U.S. soldiers.As Lara Kiswani the executive director of the Arab Resource and Organizing Center says “A militarized response to this crisis would put those most vulnerable to this pandemic and historically marginalized communities at further risk of harm and marginalization. By instilling fear in people such a response would discourage communities to seek critical services or worse yet criminalize the same people who are most at risk in turn exacerbating this public health crisis.”Expanding Our Political ImaginationAt the very least the need to protect people from military force should be vociferously discussed in public forums. The fact that it’s not shows that as a country our government’s default posture is that of militarism relying on the Department of Defense to perform duties that should be run by civilians. Over the long term we must change this state of affairs. After all the coronavirus outbreak is not the only crisis we face. When we begin to feel the worst effects of the climate crisis are we just going to hand the country over to unelected military brass? Each time there is drought or a superstorm are we going to expand the security state while shrinking the welfare state?Instead of further fortifying the US military during times of crisis we need to build robust civilian social programs like Medicare for All and a Green New Deal that allow us to efficiently and effectively disburse medical care and social support both in the event of crises and on the day to day. In theory civilian-run domestic institutions like FEMA should be playing this role but having been gutted and given a limited purview they’re not equipped to handle the scope of the current crisis.But we also must not suffer from a failure of political imagination in the present moment. The United States should be spending trillions of dollars to keep afloat the millions of people who are losing their jobs in the midst of this crisis. We should be using all options on the table: transforming corporate offices and hotels into hospitals and housing for the unhoused passing blanket moratoriums for water and electricity shutoffs and letting people out of prisons where the virus is spreading. “Resources and job creation can happen by caring for the community and providing social goods for everyone instead of militarization and coming in with guns and tanks” says Cindy Wiesner the executive director of Grassroots Global Justice Alliance. “There are ways we can make demands in this moment to have a paradigm shift about what well-being and safety mean.” Critical to all this the US military must remove its boot from the necks of people around the world who desperately need a reprieve from war and sanctions in the midst of a global pandemic.Hyper-militarism may be a tempting short-term emergency strategy but its ubiquity is a testament to the failures of the US welfare state. Replacing it with strong public institutions under civilian control as the go-to large-scale logistical institution in times of crisis should be an urgent priority — to get us through this crisis and the next one.
296,Workers Are More Valuable Than CEOs,MINDY ISSER,Jacobin,-2,https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/coronavirus-low-wage-workers-front-lines-grocery-store,Low-wage workers are on the front line in the battle against coronavirus. While many workers have started telecommuting — and many others have unfortunately been laid off — low-wage workers are busy cleaning our streets making sure we have enough to eat and of course nursing us back to health if we get COVID-19. Despite being linchpins of a functional society these workers are often treated as expendable or dismissed as “unskilled.” But over the past few weeks we’ve seen just how irreplaceable they are.In California New York Illinois Pennsylvania New Jersey and elsewhere state governments have rolled out increasingly strict orders to enforce social distancing and close all businesses except those deemed “essential” or “life-sustaining.” While these lists vary from state to state each includes grocery stores laundromats restaurants (serving takeout and delivery) factories that produce foodstuffs and other products gas stations pharmacies and hospitals.What do all of these businesses have in common? They rely on the labor of low-wage workers who in many cases toil without benefits unions and workplace protections. Public workers are still on the clock too cleaning our streets delivering our mail and making sure we have access to utilities and other social services. While many government workers have unions they are often accorded the same lack of respect as their low-wage private-sector counterparts.But imagine a global pandemic without postal workers or UPS drivers getting us our messages and packages; without cashiers and stockers keeping grocery stores up and running and full of food; without care and domestic workers providing life-saving medical and emotional support to some of society’s most at-risk people; without utility workers making sure we have a supply of water electricity and gas; without laundromat workers enabling us to clean our clothes towels and sheets; without sanitation workers collecting our trash and slowing the spread of germs.While many individuals have expressed appreciation for these frontline workers — leaving hand sanitizer out for their letter carrier; calling for an increase in teachers’ salaries after having to homeschool their kids for a few days — our society has long undervalued them both monetarily and otherwise. That’s starting to change thanks to the crisis and worker organizing that has turned up the heat on bosses.Minnesota Michigan and Vermont have all classified grocery store employees as emergency workers making them eligible for childcare and other services. Stop & Shop workers have received a 10 percent pay increase and two additional weeks of paid sick leave. Safeway Target and Whole Foods workers won a $2-per-hour increase. And unionized workers at Kroger in Washington state have been given hazard pay a demand taken up by many grocery and other frontline workers across the country. These victories while small have inched us closer to a society where low-wage workers finally get the remuneration and respect they deserve.But what does it say about our country when the jobs that are most critical to sustaining life at its basic level are also some of the lowest paid and least valued? Grocery store workers and first responders are exposing themselves to a massive health crisis in order to keep the rest of us functioning as normally as possible. Many of them work for minimum wage or close to it — and without health benefits — meaning that they could contract coronavirus and get stuck with either a massive bill or no health care at all. Meanwhile with many school districts closed indefinitely parents are missing the critical and challenging work done every day by nannies childcare workers and educators of all kinds.These workers have a right to higher wages full benefits health and safety guarantees and strong unions — just like every other worker.Hopefully this crisis will not only elevate the status of low-wage workers but spark a new wave of organizing to boost standards and build power across these “essential” industries. Because it’s low-wage workers — not bankers landlords or CEOs — who make our society run.
297,Crises Have a Way of Accelerating History,KIM PHILLIPS-FEIN,Jacobin,-2,https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/coronavirus-crisis-new-york-kim-phillips-fein,Everything just fell apart so quickly” my student wrote explaining why she was late submitting the midterm paper — as though any explanation was needed. After all we had all gone to sleep in one world and woken up in another.The elevator news stream in my high-rise building should have provided some warning. In late December over the holiday break it reported that a novel coronavirus had appeared in the Wuhan province of China. Sixteen people had it then forty-one. Then the news stream was turned off. But still the crisis seemed far away on the other side of the world; New York by some illusion of exceptionalism and cushion of privilege a space apart.Crisis has a way of accelerating history as things that seem impossible become real in moments. If someone told you in January that the NCAA basketball tournament would be canceled that the New York Public Library system would be shuttered that academic conferences years in the making would fail to be held that Major League Baseball would have no opening day that the bars and restaurants and stores of New York City would be closed that universities would send their students home — all of it would seem preposterous.And yet the consensus shifted so rapidly. For parents in the New York City public schools on the last Friday that school was open (March 13) not sending your children because of the coronavirus seemed an extreme difficult decision one that had to be weighed against the immense upheaval it would cause. But over the weekend the mood was changing and many parents had elected to keep their children home the following week. By Sunday night the system was shut down and 1.1 million New York City schoolchildren were cast adrift from the daily and familiar world the ballast of school suddenly absent the great old buildings quiet except for emergency food.At the same time crises also reveal changes taking place beneath the surface suddenly making stark and unavoidable developments that had previously been in the background. In this case many of the long-standing conflicts that make a coherent response to the coronavirus difficult seem only too evident.There are decades of underfunding public health and the public hospital system; in New York as the city prepares to repurpose university dorms as makeshift intensive care units and the army sends a hospital ship one cannot help but think of the hospitals closed following the 1975 fiscal crisis. There is the drug of poisonous nationalism undone by a germ that knows no borders and that a wall could never keep out.There are the assaults on public education on science on reason and on solidarity — the building blocks of the capacity to understand risk to think of our individual actions in terms of a larger whole. And there is the exaltation of wealth and consumerism above the unbearable daily heroism of emergency medical technicians nurses hospital orderlies doctors care workers of all sorts — those who carry out the essential functions of our society whose courage and labor are suddenly etched on the public consciousness.Finally it is true that crises so often consolidate power at the top. Looking for stability it is easy to fall back on authorities that claim to promise it. Crises can become moments of austerity and extreme reaction and it is all too easy to imagine movement in this way today.But at the same time it may be impossible for the old order to seem so safe again. Out of the upending of ordinary life perhaps something new can come. If things can change so suddenly so dramatically — what else might be possible what new spring might come forth?
298,Andrew Cuomo to New York Construction Workers: Your Money or Your Life,ALEX N. PRESS,Jacobin,-2,https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/new-york-city-coronavirus-construction-workers,I'm genuinely concerned a lot of us could die. Most are older and already have a variety of job-related health issues.” So Avery* a New York City construction worker told me yesterday. He passed along photos shared to a Facebook group for city construction workers taken Tuesday morning at a commercial skyscraper in Manhattan. In the pictures workers are seen crowded together as they wait for freight elevators — no protective measures to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 are visible.Workers at 1 Vanderbilt Avenue New York.Which is odd because New York is on PAUSE as of Sunday night (the cutesy acronym stands for “Policies Assure Uniform Safety for Everyone”). This means all “nonessential” workers are required to stay home (along with myriad other measures) to halt the spread of coronavirus which at last count has afflicted nearly 31000 New York City residents — more than 7 percent of the 431000 confirmed cases worldwide.The state guidance issued as an executive order says that essential construction work consists of “skilled trades such as electricians plumbers” as well as “other related construction firms and professionals for essential infrastructure or for emergency repair and safety purposes.”The second category makes sense — workers building hospitals say or repairing schools are clearly essential — but the first effectively designates as essential all of the city’s approximately 150000 construction workers. Workers in New York City’s deadliest profession are being asked to further risk their health for the sake of luxury condos and commercial office buildings.As the death cult of Donald Trump and Wall Street contemplate whether to encourage people to return to work prematurely to shore up company profits and Governor Cuomo “still figures out” how to strike the right balance between protecting lives and economy viability workers’ well-being is being treated as less important than New York City’s real estate sector.“It’s a Fucking Disaster”“It’s scary” says Peter who worked on a site — 770 Broadway Facebook’s offices — where a worker recently tested positive for coronavirus. While some general contractors have shut down worksites the city has no policy in place to close worksites with coronavirus cases. (Sympathetic subcontractors may want to shut down sites but doing so exposes them to being sued by general contractors.) Several workers I spoke to allege that they’ve had coworkers with coronavirus at still-operational job sites.“We’re jammed in the freight elevator like sardines” says Peter when asked about working conditions at 770 Broadway. “The governor can’t stop the spread there’s no social distancing. It should be shut down.”New York City councilmember Carlos Menchaca criticized Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office for not shuttering sites where workers have tested positive. Menchaca also took issue with the Real Estate Board of New York after its president told the City that “basic economic activity” needs to be maintained amid the coronavirus crisis. Capital accumulation in the metropolis goes on workers’ lives be damned — not to mention the dangers construction workers are posing to say the medical professionals with whom they’re sharing public transit. For capital continued economic activity is far more “essential” than public health measures.Wes who builds new public schools for a company that operates across all five boroughs says “it’s like nothing has changed” at his worksites. This despite the city’s union contractors and the Building and Construction Trades Council “issuing a two-page guideline for union sites that includes handwashing stations hand sanitizer and limiting the numbers of workers in confined areas.”“No one tells you ‘OK here’s a hand-washing station over there is some hand sanitizer.’ There’s nothing like that” says Wes. “It’s a fucking disaster.”While workers can stay home if they choose doing so means forfeiting wages and even access to unemployment. Plus losing work can mean losing health care. Construction workers say they’re scared of being blackballed should they choose to skip work. “A lot of guys are afraid of that” says Peter.“What choice do I really have?” asks Wes. “I have some paid time off. But if I take those days now what happens if this gets worse? And I have a two-year-old; I’m going to need days to take off.”Construction workers are facing a stick-up: “your money or your life” is no choice at all. They need stability and safety now. Those laboring on truly essential construction and repairs must have a safe work environment; they must not face any retaliation for refusing to work in unsafe conditions. Every one of them — union nonunion or independent contractor — needs free health care 100 percent of their income and retirement security in this moment of crisis so they can opt to take time off rather than continue to toil under duress and fear. If the United Kingdom can guarantee workers up to 80 percent of their wages there’s no reason the United States can’t take similar steps. While the eviction moratorium is a good start as the first of the month approaches suspending rent payments will be vital in a city as expensive as New York.“I fear that it’s going to be a repeat of 2008–9” says Wes. “We’re going to give all this money to save these industries and not make it contingent on giving it to the workers.” While he hopes Congress will pass a bill with some pro-worker strings attached he’s not holding his breath. “Pelosi Schumer? I don’t know how much they have workers’ backs” he says.We need construction workers healthy and ready for the essential tasks of building critical infrastructure. Condos and office buildings can wait; if they don’t we don’t know how many people will be left to fill them after this crisis.
299,Chaos on the Front Line,MEAGAN DAY,Jacobin,-2,https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/front-line-health-care-workers-california-coronavirus,The Centers for Disease Control estimates that anywhere between two million and twenty-two million Americans will be hospitalized with COVID-19 — in a nation that has less than a million hospital beds. It’s not as if those beds are currently empty either. In fact America’s hospitals and health care workers are already stretched thin. The coronavirus epidemic threatens to deliver them to the breaking point.This crisis represents the convergence of multiple preexisting problems. One of these is that the United States’ uncoordinated patchwork of public and private hospitals has been subject for decades to a “lean production” management approach borrowed from the private manufacturing sector which purportedly aims to cut waste trim fat and improve efficiency.In reality what this has meant is that cost-cutting measures have led to shortages in workers space and equipment. Our overwhelmed understaffed austerity-starved hospital system is already in bad shape. It’s not ready for what’s to come.Bad to WorseAll over the country frontline health care workers are demanding immediate changes to help them prepare for the coming flood of coronavirus patients. They’re focusing especially on one pressing problem: the national shortage of personal protective equipment or PPE including masks gloves face shields gowns booties sani wipes soap and hand sanitizer.Without these health care workers can’t treat coronavirus patients without potentially transmitting the virus to noninfected patients who will then not only be at risk of illness but will become carriers further endangering the public. Health care workers who lack proper equipment also can’t protect themselves and their coworkers from infection. Frontline workers deserve protection for their own sake but an additional consideration is that if they’re taken out of commission by illness their absence exacerbates the understaffing issue and the crisis in general.“It’s hard to tell how bad the PPE shortage is because hospital administrators aren’t being transparent about what’s going on” says John Pearson an ER nurse at Highland Hospital in Oakland California. “It’s all inconsistent and disorganized. Different managers say different things.”Highland is one of nine public hospitals and clinics that comprise the Alameda Health System or AHS. “In all of AHS workers are having a hard time getting basic PPE” Pearson says. “Managers are hoarding it rationing it out. Workers are told to go find their manager if they need more PPE but on some shifts especially nights and weekends there’s no manager on duty.”“We’re told to reuse single-use masks and store them in paper bags which just spreads disease from person to person” Pearson continues. “One manager told people to spray their mask with cleaning fluid which means you’re breathing in cleaning fluid as well as using a dirty mask. Managers got caught watering down hand sanitizer which makes it completely ineffective. Some managers are telling people they get one sani wipe per day. We use dozens of those a day.”Pearson is the president of his chapter of SEIU Local 1021 which represents nurses nurses’ aides EMTs respiratory therapists social workers housekeeping workers cafeteria workers and others. He has created a Twitter account to expose the seriousness of the PPE shortage issue. One post shows a sanitization station bearing a sign that reads “Please take a mask” but the space where the masks are supposed to be is empty save for one piece of garbage. Another shows hand soap brought by workers from home.Highland Hospital has been subject to the lean-production approach for two decades now. It’s one of four public acute-care hospitals serving Alameda County home to 1.6 million people. It provides care to patients who are homeless have no insurance or cannot afford to pay medical bills. Like many aspects of our society that serve the poor Highland is underfunded and understaffed.Pearson says that before coronavirus workers at Highland were already used to seeing trash that doesn’t get taken out including overflowing sharps containers. They were accustomed to seeing blood stains left on the curtains and beds from previous patients and blood-contaminated water that sits out for days. All of this is incredibly hazardous for patients and workers already and a pandemic caused by a highly infectious virus adds major new urgency to the sanitation issue.But instead of stepping up sanitation efforts Person says hospital management has simply told workers to carry on and make do. One post on Pearson’s Twitter features a photo of a housekeeping worker who was instructed this past week to wipe down beds with reusable washcloths instead of sani wipes. “We are on the front lines of infection control” reads the sign he’s holding up “and management won’t give us masks or sani wipes!!!”Another post on Pearson’s Twitter is a video made by a community health outreach worker at Highland who responds to sexual assault cases in the ER. She and her teammates are being denied proper protective equipment to be around patients during this crisis. “I myself a sexual assault survivor would not want to be at a public hospital in the emergency room and have an advocate respond to my bedside without a mask because they were told that they couldn’t be provided a mask” she says in the video.One crucial piece of protective equipment is called a PAPR a powered air purifying respirator. PAPRs greatly reduce the risk of inhaling airborne pathogens and are especially needed when performing aerosol-generating procedures like placing an emergency airway in a patient who is in respiratory failure. That’s exactly what happens to critical COVID-19 patients — but the Highland ER does not have enough PAPRs.“What this means is that only three people are allowed inside with potential COVID patients right now because we only have three PAPRs” says Pearson. “The absence of this equipment is lowering the speed and quality of care per patient already. And things haven’t even gotten bad yet.” The situation is so dire that this week a GoFundMe sprung up overnight started by a family member of a doctor to buy more PAPRs for workers in the Highland ER.Surge RedFor years Highland has had a problem with understaffing and overcrowding. Situations frequently arise in which patients are stuck waiting for hours in the ER before receiving treatment. In 2017 Pearson says “Management finally put a name on it and started calling it an ‘internal disaster’ or ‘surge red.’”Executives used to take surge reds somewhat seriously. “They would meet in a room on a top floor far from the ER call it a ‘command center’ and get a catered lunch — we know because they would send down the leftovers from their catered lunch” says Pearson. “But then they stopped meeting in person and tell us instead that they have a ‘virtual command center.’ They have stopped taking it seriously and the overcrowding remains a persistent problem.”During a typical surge red Pearson says “Patients end up stuck in hallways. Patients get discharged early who need to stay. Patients get deprioritized who need to be seen quickly. I’ve seen patients wait in the ER for thirteen hours to be treated. There are some months where the majority of days have this happen.”Highland and the other facilities under the AHS umbrella are technically public sector but AHS is no longer run by the county itself. As Nick French explains in East Bay Majority it is instead run by a board of trustees. The move was supposed to make the hospital more efficient but as French observes “Things have not worked out that way: making AHS an independent entity has led to massive dysfunction.” Because the hospital can’t directly access the county’s general fund it must borrow. Debt has led to budget cuts which has exacerbated the understaffing and overcrowding issue.Now as the hospital is prepared to be overwhelmed by coronavirus patients Pearson says that understaffing is posing serious threats. For example the ER at Highland already had only one part-time nurse educator whose job it is to train nurses on new procedures and new pathologies like COVID-19. Hands-on on-the-spot training is necessary to equip hospital workers to deal with both this novel virus and the frightening new hospital conditions that will be created by the pandemic. But the only nurse educator has just been issued a layoff notice.Because there’s so much concern about a rapid surge of COVID-19 patients workers have taken it upon themselves to get trained. “Workers are training each other on how to use equipment and about COVID-19 while the only form of training management is offering is over email” says Pearson.AHS is also dangerously short on respiratory therapists. When a patient can’t breathe the respiratory therapist is the one with the knowledge and expertise to keep their lungs working and run life-sustaining ventilators. The entire country is experiencing a shortage of ventilators demand for which has skyrocketed as people around the world succumb to COVID-19. Without the staff or the equipment to help people breathe Highland and hospitals like it are unprepared for an influx of patients who struggle to do it on their own.In the lead-up to the coming crisis chaos is mounting. Ad-hoc isolation rooms are being set up but health care workers are struggling to find enough HEPA filters the medical air purifiers that reduce airborne pathogens. Workers are left to improvise all by themselves: in the emergency department at Highland there are vacant manager and director positions and only two assistant managers. The hospital isn’t ready for the greatest American public health crisis in a hundred years.Reversing AusterityLike frontline health care workers all over the country the staff at Highland Hospital are terrified of what’s to come. Their spirits have been lifted by displays of solidarity such as when one coworker who works in a basement office away from patients took it upon herself to collect PPE for workers who are at the bedside and when members and leaders of the community began collecting and sending in supplies.Pearson says these examples of people pulling together are helping and he hopes they will continue. But donations will not be enough to prepare Highland for the chaos to come. Through their union workers are demanding that management supply them with more equipment better staffing and more training to deal with the crisis.And Pearson says the state must step in as well. The state of California must “take control of the state’s supply chain for PPE and direct factories in California to produce essential equipment” says Pearson. California must also “locate and requisition stockpiles of essential supplies” held by the private sector and distribute them where they’re needed and “create a central tracking system to distribute tests and equipment based on need not ability to pay.”Pearson also says that to weather the crisis the state of California will need to start treating its hospitals differently operating at high staffing levels in contravention of the lean-production model. He thinks the state should fund free medical training and create a fast-track licensing program to fix the understaffing issue and reopen all of the hospitals it has closed in the last five years.Austerity got the hospital system and all of the patients who depend on it into this mess. It will take a reversal of austerity to get out of it.
300,Canada’s Coronavirus Response Shows Why We Need Medicare for All to Fight This Pandemic,ALEX LEVESQUE,Jacobin,-2,https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/canada-coronavirus-medicare-for-all-single-payer-health-care,If anyone had any doubts about how catastrophic our for-profit health-care system is the past few weeks should set those doubts to rest. Unfortunately many pundits and even the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination are still arguing that a single-payer health-care system would not improve our current circumstances pointing to Italy’s situation as evidence that Medicare for All would not help during a pandemic — and might even result in worse outcomes.This argument is absurd of course. A single-payer system like Medicare for All is much better equipped to deal with exactly this sort of public health emergency including in Italy than the United States’ fragmented for-profit system. And the vision of a single-payer health-care system could not only help us guide our approach to the current crisis but also leave us better prepared for the next one.For an example of what a single-payer response to coronavirus could look like we need look no farther than the United States’ northern neighbor. Politically Canada shares much in common with the United States: an embrace of neoliberalism and free trade deals the support of interventionist wars centuries of unaddressed colonialism and prioritizing the needs of fossil fuel companies over the planet’s. One stark difference between the two countries though is that Canada has a (mostly) single-payer health-care system.This difference in health-care systems is leading to two increasingly different responses to the coronavirus pandemic responses that make clear the benefits of addressing a public-health crisis with a single-payer health-care system.A Coordinated Public-Health ResponseI'm a dual American-Canadian citizen and over the past weeks I’ve read countless stories on social media of exasperated American friends seeking coronavirus testing who describe a complex journey navigating between primary-care providers hospitals and local health departments. The fragmented nature of the US health-care system has made it difficult to coordinate a response or testing strategy especially between completely separate health-care providers that often have different testing equipment and protocols.Meanwhile in Canada the provincial government is essentially the only financier of hospitals and health-care providers in each province making it much easier to coordinate strategies. In Ontario for example anyone who suspects they have coronavirus is instructed to self-assess using an online tool then either call a central Telehealth number call their primary provider or visit a dedicated assessment center. All three resources are receiving regular information from the provincial government and are able to determine what steps someone should take next: arranging testing instructing the person to self-isolate or providing reassurance. Each province has set up their own similar centralized system and even before some of the newer resources were created health departments at the local provincial and federal level were acting as central contact points for individuals and organizations.This coordination stands in stark contrast to the confusing and contradicting information provided by different levels of government in the United States especially in the earlier days of the crisis.For example on February 25 CDC officials warned that US communities should start preparing for the inevitable spread of coronavirus — while Donald Trump downplayed its severity. Then on February 29 Trump gave national remarks stating that the coronavirus threat was well under control even though Washington governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency that same day and public health officials in Washington Oregon and California were warning of possible community spread.Although some of these contradictions were undeniably due to Trump’s particular idiosyncrasies it is notable that there is no central public-health apparatus in the United States that can facilitate the type of cooperation seen between different levels of the government in Canada during that same time.The role of the Canadian public health units in coherently efficiently responding to coronavirus can’t be understated. By March 12 the entirety of the United States had completed less than three times the number of tests as the province of Ontario alone — despite having twenty times the population. Meanwhile public-health physicians at the local level were holding frequent consultations with universities local governments and other organizations while regularly addressing the media.Although regional health units also exist in the United States they can’t perform to the same degree as Canadian regional health units because those units are not as integrated into the health-care system. Under a single-payer system such as the one in Canada the same party responsible for paying for doctors nurses and hospitals is also responsible for paying for public health. This means that the provider — in the Canadian  case the provincial government — has an interest in funding public health and preventative medicine in order to lessen the expense and burden on the rest of the health-care system.In the United States there is no incentive for a private hospital or private insurance company to fund public health measures and the publicly funded health departments act entirely separately from the privately funded health-care system. This naturally contributes to a lack of coordination in the face of public health emergencies.Accessing Health CareBeyond the benefits of coordinating public health responses under a single-payer health-care system such a system also better facilitates health-care provision itself. Universal health care is of the utmost importance during a crisis like this because we need widespread unimpeded testing and treatment to curb the spread of coronavirus.Even after it was clear that testing identifying and isolating individuals with coronavirus was the only way to stop the disease’s spread within the United States for weeks the tests themselves continued to be prohibitively expensive. Even after it was announced that insurance companies would begin fully covering testing the problem remained of how people with insurance would afford treatment for coronavirus — and how those without insurance could afford either.Decades of an American health-care system in which emergency care meant crushing debt and often bankruptcy and even receiving treatment covered by insurance can come with financially devastating hidden costs has led to a fear of using health care. This means that even with free testing and even if legislation is eventually passed to completely cover treatment many people have been conditioned to avoid seeking health care — which is exactly what you don’t want in a pandemic.And covering coronavirus treatment does nothing for those who desperately need health care for a reason not explicitly linked to the pandemic including people faced with health-care issues that emerge as side effects of our current crisis. What happens when a primary caregiver catches coronavirus and their parent needs long-term care? What happens when families affected by coronavirus need mental health support? With the media discussing the sort of health-care rationing we’ve seen in countries where coronavirus patients have overwhelmed the number of ICU beds available to treat them one has to worry what form this rationing might take in a country with a for-profit health-care system.Beyond avoiding these problems Canada’s universal health-care system also allows opportunities for swift reactions to the coronavirus pandemic. For example more than a week ago the Ontario government announced that physicians could begin to bill the province for video and phone appointments and also took steps toward creating a virtual walk-in clinic for the province. This transition still comes with a host of concerns such as the significant involvement of for-profit virtual health-care systems as part of a push toward further privatization but it shows the kind of coordinated reaction that is possible under a single-payer system.This shift to virtual care has the potential to significantly reduce the risk of exposure to coronavirus for patients seeking regular ongoing health care. This would be more difficult to coordinate on a state or national level in the United States as it would require negotiating with numerous insurance companies in order to convince them to start covering telehealth services.Room for ImprovementTo be clear Canada’s health-care system is not perfect.  For example the scenario that Bernie Sanders outlined in the recent debate about a family member of a coronavirus patient being unable to afford mental health services would also exist in Canada. When it comes to mental health dental pharmaceuticals and many other health services Canada has a multipayer system almost identical to the United States. Even when it comes to primary care the provincial government is not always the sole party responsible for paying for health-care services — health care for refugees workers injured on the job and certain indigenous communities are each funded from a different source.The Canadian public health system has also faced significant austerity especially recently and is often underfunded. And the Left in Canada will need to grapple with many of the same political questions that the Left in the United States will as we move through this crisis. For example what conditions will Canadians demand in exchange for bailouts of Canadian corporations and how will we ensure the humane concessions granted to us during this crisis like universal sick leave are not revoked once the danger has passed?Still the crisis is revealing Canada’s political strengths namely the benefit of combating a public-health emergency with a single-payer health-care system. If the United States had a single-payer health-care system right now its trajectory of this pandemic would probably resemble Canada’s. A single-payer health-care system could have meant a more coordinated public-health response in the early days of the crisis and would at the very least provide access to the health care that we need to get through it.
301,“Containing the Virus Was Going to Be Antithetical to the Economy”: Joe Biden’s Former Economic Adviser on Why This Recession Got So Bad,Kara Voght,Mother Jones,-2,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/03/jared-bernstein-coronavirus-stimulus-bailout-joe-biden/,A couple of weeks ago as companies began to ask their employees to work remotely amidst early COVID-19 fears economist Jared Bernstein had a realization. “It occurred to me pretty quickly although I didn’t recognize the magnitude containing the virus was going to be antithetical to the economy” Bernstein tells me. “In order to apply what was necessary on the health care front we’d have to put segments of the economy into a deep freeze.”Few are as attuned to the warning signs of economic ruin as Bernstein is. A longtime scholar of income inequality he served as the chief economic advisor to Joe Biden back when he was vice president. During his White House tenure Bernstein worked on the nearly $800 billion economic stimulus and job recovery plan signed into law early in Barack Obama’s term as president—without which Bernstein’s research determined the country would have seen another 3 to 4 million jobs lost during Obama’s first months in office. Bernstein who also ran the former vice president’s task force on the middle class had been heralded by the left as a key counterbalance to more bank-friendly voices in the Obama administration such as Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and National Economic Council Director Larry Summers. These days Bernstein now a senior fellow at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities informally offers advice to his former boss now the presumptive Democratic nominee for president.The remedies to address this pandemic-driven disaster can’t be the same as what was used to jumpstart the economy in past recessions. Bernstein recalls President Bush telling families to “go down to Disney World” after the September 11th terrorist attacks a tragedy that similarly ground the travel industry to a halt. “Needless to say such advice doesn’t work in this case” Bernstein says. “A lot of the medicine that we usually apply won’t have the impact it usually does.”And Bernstein says correcting that largely falls on the federal government—specifically the sorts of measures that the Senate orchestrated this week with its $2 trillion emergency relief package. Bernstein is overall happy with the bill but he doesn’t understand why the federal government reinvents the wheel every time a crisis like this hits. He points to the fact that the Senate’s stimulus package includes a dedicated watchdog and an accountability panel to oversee $500 billion in loans that will be given cities states and industries hardest hit by the pandemic—an oversight setup similar to what was established to watch over the 2008 bailouts.“In order to apply what was necessary on the health care front we’d have to put segments of the economy into a deep freeze.”“Why do we have to create this every time we hit these kinds of stretches?” Bernstein laments. “It’s not hard to see what will happen when the market fails.” He points to the lack of a robust federal unemployment system—something currently managed with varying degrees of success by the states—as well as a lack of paid family and leave. “We need to be more prepared” he says.I spoke with Bernstein about the early warning signs of trouble his take on the Senate bill and what he’s watching for as emergency money finds its way into consumers’ hands.I thought early on that we were in for a lot of trouble. As every economist knows the US economy is almost 70 percent consumer spending. So if you’re going to tell even a small portion of the American consumer population that they have to come out of the game for a while that’s going to be a hit to growth. My initial thought was that growth in the first half of the year could be somewhere around zero. If things get as bad as I expect I now see of course that was very wishful thinking.There’s no doubt we’re now in a recession. How is this different from the one you tackled during your time in the White House and others in recent history?Well the easiest way to explain the difference between now and [other recessions] is to remember that after Congress and President Bush sent out the first round of stimulus checks [after 9/11] the president said “Take your rebate check and go in a plane and go down to Disney World” which may sound kind of cavalier but it was understandable advice given the role of consumer spending on our economy. Needless to say such advice doesn’t work in this case. So one difference is that I don’t think any of us have ever been—with the exception of a couple days after 9/11—in a situation where our economy had to be put in a deep freeze in order to deal with a health threat. It means that a lot of the medicine that we usually apply won’t have the impact that it usually does. The Federal Reserve is a very good example. You can cut interest rates as low as you want but you’re not going to reschedule a conference or go to a restaurant because interest rates are zero.Because monetary policy simply can’t have the punch that it usually does fiscal policy is that much more important. We’ve talked a ton about the Fed lately but at the end of the day it’s what Congress is doing. It’s going to make the biggest immediate difference to households and businesses. And that’s why they cannot get any further behind this fiscal curve.We now have a picture of the emergency relief measures Congress and the White House agree on. Who benefits the most from this stopgap measure? Who gets left behind?The most important thing is the $250 billion for unemployment insurance. That was something [Senate Minority Leader Chuck] Schumer insisted on getting in there—the next time I see him I’m going to bump elbows with him heartily. The most important direct beneficiaries are families and small businesses. Obviously there are literally millions—I would say at least 20 million middle and low-wage workers who have no paid leave—and even if they’re employed but their workplace is closed they’ve got no income. I can also tell you that they have virtually no savings. So these are people who if they lack a paycheck for a couple of weeks in a row are looking at serious provation possible eviction. There are things that some localities are doing including eviction moratoriums that can help them—food banks are ramping up I get that. But the most important thing to do is get money in their pockets as quickly as possible.Now here’s the wrinkle that I don’t know how much of this is appreciated. In order to get the rebate check you have to have filed a tax return for 2018 or 2019 or get Social Security [or Medicaid]. A lot of the people I’m talking about won’t have filed a tax return. That doesn’t mean they’re ineligible. In fact they are eligible thanks to some of the work of the Democrats and my colleagues at the Center on Budget by the way. That doesn’t mean they’re ineligible it means that they have to file a tax return to get their check. And that’s going to be a super important thing. I mean this is not something that we can fool around with for weeks or months. These folks needed assistance yesterday. So we have to make sure those of us who are in the policy community explain to these folks that they have to file they can do it online and they can even get assistance from the IRS to do so. But that’s going to be really important.I think $350 billion for small businesses is very helpful particularly because while that is a loan—a guaranteed loan so that the creditors and the lenders will be backstopped by the government—the federal government is forgiving the part of that loan that businesses use to maintain their payrolls. So I thought that was a smart piece of work.There are a couple of omissions in terms of who’s not getting help. One of the most important omissions is fiscal relief for states. During the last recession when I was in government we had a really pretty robust effective efficient quick-acting state fiscal relief program which we administered by just tweaking up the federal government’s contribution to state Medicaid expenditures. It’s called the FMAP [Federal Medical Assistance Percentage]. We ratcheted up the federal contribution and states could get that money. And it’s not just for Medicaid—it’s technically for Medicaid but these dollars are fungible so every dollar they don’t have to put into Medicaid because they get it from the Feds can go towards unemployment insurance or public workers or a full set of needs.[The final relief package which was still being negotiated at the time of this interview includes $150 billion in fungible relief. Bernstein tells me that’s a welcome change but still thinks FMAP funds should be in there as well.]There’s been a ton of attention on the daily ups and downs of the stock market—particularly from the White House which seems eager to make them stop. Do those daily fluctuations matter? And if not what other economic indicators should politicians be looking at instead when planning stimulus?Well I certainly wouldn’t pay attention to the ups and downs especially from the perspective of if you have a big up day like Tuesday—don’t think you’re out of the woods. So I would be pretty asymmetric about my assessments. You know they say the stock market is not the economy but it’s not not the economy and I think that’s fair. The important thing about the massive sell off is its impact on people—its impact on 401K’s and our retirement plans. I was talking to a friend last night who said “Well my retirement is now put off for another year.” That’s a big deal. And the stock market is one of these forward-looking indicators that suggests how steep and deep this recession is.“A lot of the medicine that we usually apply won’t have the impact it usually does.”But the more structurally important indicator in the financial markets is actually the debt market—the market for treasuries corporate debt and things like that. And that’s where the Fed has been particularly active because at least initially it looked like that  market was operating pretty smoothly which is very important. We already had a supply shock then we had a demand shock—we certainly didn’t need a financial shock on top of that. The last downturn was a financial shock that set everything off. In recent days and weeks we’ve had some clogging in the pipes of the credit markets and the Fed has intervened aggressively to try to unclog the plumbing and they’ve been at least moderately successful. And that’s really important. I mean we’re going to be borrowing our asses off to finance this stimulus and we need a functional Treasury market for that. Right now I thought the intervention that the Fed did Monday seems to have helped. But we’ve seen this movie where things look clear for a couple of days and then they get a little bit shaky again. The Fed is definitely on the case and committed to trying to make sure credit markets remain fluid.In terms of the indicators that I tell politicians to look at: first of all unemployment claims are very revealing and we’ve already seen them spiking [to 3.3 million]. And that’s just after a week. In the Great Recession we were tearing our hair out because we lost 2.3 million jobs in the first quarter of 2009. So I would look at the claims and basically more broadly I would look at what we call “real economy” indicators. So not just the financial market—not that that’s false—but the real stuff has to be incomes and jobs wages. Those are the indicators I’d look at. The problem is that they’re either coincident or kind of lagging and so you have to try to see around the corner where they’re headed.Lawmakers predict this is only the first in a series of bills lawmakers will try to pass to address this crisis. What are the longer-term structural economic remedies you’d recommend to better prepare for future disasters like this?That’s pretty easy to me. We need a national paid leave program. We need a much more comprehensive unemployment insurance program with a larger federal role because we’ve got some states that have taken their UI systems apart for ideological reasons—North Carolina’s a good example.
302,Campaigning As We Know It Is Over,Tim Murphy,Mother Jones,-2,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/03/campaigning-as-we-know-it-is-over/,In the fall of 1920 Warren G. Harding won the biggest popular-vote landslide in history without ever holding a rally. Instead of hitting the trail the Republican nominee let the campaign come to him. About once a day Harding emerged from his home in Marion Ohio to address a small crowd of voters and reporters who wrote up his remarks for their readers across the country. A multimillion-dollar advertising budget took care of the rest. Harding’s “front-porch campaign” was a product of its time—a more dignified manner of politicking in an age when traditional campaigning was sometimes seen as gauche. (When Democrat William Jennings Bryan went on tour in 1896 one critic said he was “begging for the Presidency as a tramp might beg for a pie.”)But a century later the long-distance campaign is back by default. The coronavirus has shut down political campaigning—and virtually everything else. Neither former Vice President Joe Biden the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee nor Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has held in-person events with voters since before the March 10 Michigan primary. President Trump has canceled his rallies for the foreseeable future. Candidates at all levels across the country are adapting and experimenting on the fly as they wrestle with how to engage supporters persuade voters and raise money when many Americans are stuck inside sick or out of work. Biden greets his grandkids from his front porch; he’s greeting voters from his basement.“I’m not sure anybody really knows what a completely virtual and online campaign really looks like and anybody who says they do is lying” said Addisu Demissie a Democratic operative who managed New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker’s presidential campaign.And that’s really the only sure thing right now: For the time being whatever happens is going to have to happen remotely. When Sanders’ campaign announced ahead of last Tuesday’s primaries in Arizona Florida and Illinois that it would not undertake any traditional get-out-the-vote efforts it was merely codifying what was already happening. Campaigns have quit door-knocking petition-gathering and holding in-person town halls and rallies. Now they’re figuring out how to fill the void.“Most campaigns are small businesses. And they are gonna feel the crunch in an entirely different way because they’re entirely funded by voluntary donations. Are they gonna be able to hire? Are they gonna be able to write any sort of plan based on predicting the future when you can’t predict what’s gonna happen tomorrow?”Getting in front of a camera is probably the easiest problem to solve at least from a technical standpoint. Trump of course can get on TV whenever he wants and has turned his daily briefings on the pandemic into freewheeling campaign-style riffs. Sanders has invested for years in virtual events; since going to ground he’s held “fireside chats” in front of a wood stove at his Burlington home; filmed short messages from his back yard; and brought in key surrogates for a Hollywood Squares–style split-screen conversation on the pandemic.Biden started off on shakier footing. At a fundraiser on Sunday (held via teleconference) one donor said they were “concerned” that “we see Donald Trump every day with this crisis” asking the candidate “How do we get more of you and less of him on our airwaves?” Campaign aides initially told ABC that his home’s low ceilings made it difficult to get good-enough light. But by Monday morning he had a studio in his game room fully optimized for TV hits and livestreams.A bigger challenge for candidates is figuring out how to do all the other things that in-person gatherings are designed to accomplish—rallies for instance are important organizing efforts a chance for the campaign to gauge how it’s doing collect information on thousands of voters sign up volunteers and forge connections with targeted communities.
303,How the Coronavirus Brought Chain Mail Back to the Mainstream,Ali Breland,Mother Jones,-2,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/03/coronavirus-chain-mail/,Being cooped up at home to slow the spread of coronavirus is forcing a lot of us to grapple with new technologies. To fight isolation friends have turned to “Netflix Party” a browser extension that lets people sync their computers to watch movies or TV together. Offices are using video conferencing tools like Zoom and Google Hangouts to run remote meetings. Shut-ins are using the same apps to hold virtual happy hours. Mourners are using them to hold funerals. But aside from spreading new technologies the coronavirus has brought back at least one nearly forgotten one: chain mail. Harmful chain messages have gotten a massive second wind.Chain messages warning that cities will be shut down saying martial law will be imposed or promoting hoax preventative measures have spread far and wide in the last several weeks not just on bulletin boards and social media but through text messages and emails. Their original sources are unknown and the information they pass along is usually misleading or outright wrong—just like the postal nuisance chain mail of old. For a minute in the 2010s it seemed like the scourge of chain mail or at least most the harmful kind had been nearly vanquished. The medium was long past its heyday in the 90s and early 2000s and the chain messages that still went around were mostly relegated to aging baby boomers seemingly fated to die when they did.Even though they’re not passed around as much hobby archivists have preserved our chain mail history including emails promising fabulous wealth or the potential to avoid injury or death. On a website that appears to have last been updated in 2019 but looks like it’s from a 1990s internet before people used colors or images independent researcher Daniel W. VanArsdale keeps a collection of chain letters going as far back as 1917 along with papers he’s written on related subjects. Another 90s-looking site indexing chain mail is run by Donald Watrous a systems programmer at Rutgers University. “If you have always dreamed of getting that lucky break you just got it!” reads one 1999 example of paper chain mail documented in VanArsdale’s collection  purportedly from a person named David Rhodes. “If you follow these instructions exactly in good faith your dreams will come true…in 20 to 60 days you would receive more cash than you would believe all in the mail!”The timing suggests this likely illegal physical chain letter could have been one of the last of its kind. Even prior to its circulation just before the turn of the millennium chain messages were already starting to migrate to email where the barriers to creating and spreading them widely were lower. An outlandish 1998 email one in Watrous’s archive opens with; “Folks I called Disney my damn self. It’s no lie. GET IT DONE! You all owe me.” Chain mail threatening supernatural harm or bad luck was capitalized on people’s sense of fear.“If you read below you will see the note from Walt Disney Jr. & Management at Disney World. Basically if this messages reaches 13000 people everyone will receive $5000.00 or a free all expenses paid trip to Disney World in anytime during the summer of 1999” it continues. How does Disney know where to distribute the money and park visits? Via a supposed “Bill Gates’ Beta Email Tracking” system deployed by Disney in partnership with Microsoft that “tracks everyone to whom this message is forwarded.”There’s no way a medium based on such absurd premises could keep going. While the internet enabled the easy spread of such messages it also provided the ability to verify or debunk information by opening a new tab and pressing a few keys. And they didn’t keep going. While fact-checking doesn’t always stem the spread of misinformation—as our current era clearly indicates—in the case of the simple and obviously outlandish lies of chain emails it seemed to work. With the rise of Snopes and other myth-busting sites email chains mostly faded consigned to older less-tech literate generations. The chain mail that remained and circulated outside the geriatric crowd is usually tongue in cheek like extremely lewd and emoji-laden viral texts—irony soaked messages meant to spread a joke not deceive.But like any other gross and opportunistic virus chain mail never entirely died and such texts were only one way the messages evolved and kept going on new platforms. Back in 2013 John Herrman explained for BuzzFeed News how Facebook helped a new heartwarming strain of chain mail thrive: “For a casual Facebook user verifying a post and sharing it are both easier than ever before. But one of those two things is still significantly easier than the other and Facebook’s rewards system favors the latter.” Posts with titles like “THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL LIFE LESSON” and “This man found a dying dog and nursed it back to health. You HAVE to read what he wrote” spread far and fast. They weren’t like older chain mail stories promising the recipient would be murdered or haunted if it wasn’t forwarded—a style to which most people had become desensitized.“By forwarding them we allow ourselves to believe that we can command the future.”Like the forms before it heartwarming chain mail and Facebook posts fell back and chain messages again mostly went into hibernation. The most prominent exception was a rash of Facebook posts across the last decade where users seemed to believe that copying and pasting texts beginning with “I do not give Facebook permission…” would protect their data and constitute a legally binding agreement with the company. This copypasta—a recirculated and replicated messageboard post roughly equivalent to chain mail—infected Facebook duping even supposedly tech-savvy millennials. Another copy pasta from 2016 claimed to be in the name of Dakota Access Pipeline protestors and asked Facebook users to from the comfort of their own homes “check-in at Standing Rock ND to overwhelm and confuse” law enforcement trying to surveil protestors through social media and urged people to pass the message on.But potentially harmful chain messages have gotten a massive second wind this year as it became clear that America wouldn’t be able to dodge the coronavirus which had been ravaging China Iran and Italy. Almost two weeks ago when people started realizing the scale of the threat and mobbing grocery stores in response a hoax message went viral from someone who claimed to be friends of friends with someone at the New York Police Department saying that parts of the city’s transportation network would be “shutting down.” NBC’s Ben Collins chronicled how other false text messages warning of martial law surged nationwide. As early as January even before it became apparent that the coronavirus would affect the U.S. at scale copypasta hit the internet from someone claiming to know someone at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urging tips to combat the coronavirus including the unsubstantiated advice that frequently drinking water would curb the virus. That message eventually ended up in my colleague Rebecca Leber’s inbox in March suggesting that it later circulated widely as a chain email. The Facebook permissions and Dakota Access pipeline copypastas show people eager to share chain messages about their fear of real things and that mesh with a desire to make the world a better place. Coronavirus chain mail has taken advantage of both instincts. “It’s playing off people’s goodwill to share information with loved ones and protect one another” says Joan Donovan director of the Harvard Shorenstein Center’s Technology and Social Change Research Project.“It’s playing off people’s goodwill to share information.”This has basically always been the formula for chain mail or any other social engineering project designed to exploit human psychology like phishing or other scams. Old chain mail threatening supernatural harm or bad luck or promise riches was trying to capitalize on people’s sense of fear or opportunity. If we didn’t share the message we thought there was a chance we might we’d be killed by the ghost of a small girl or miss out Bill Gates sharing his fortune. We may have recognized it was a small chance but forwarding the message was worth it given the negligible downside risk. Or as Bijan Stephen distills it for The Verge: “The appeal of chain letters is about control: By forwarding them we allow ourselves to believe that we can command the future. Or at least ward off the worst.”That’s where we are with the coronavirus. We don’t know a lot about it. Scientists don’t even know that much yet. People are ready to grasp at anything to feel like might make them safer and they’re willing to pass on whatever they learn too. In this ‘I’ll believe anything and spread it’ phase sharing the messages can give fleeting hope of gaining some control over a situation that feels uncontrollable.
304,Beyond Narcissism Trump’s Other Personality Flaws Are Putting Americans at Risk,David Corn,Mother Jones,-2,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/03/beyond-narcissism-trumps-other-personality-flaws-are-putting-americans-at-risk/,Throughout the coronavirus crisis critics of Donald Trump have repeatedly referenced his profound and outrageous narcissism. It was partly this pathology that led Trump to downplay the threat and resist widespread testing for weeks. An honest acknowledgement of the mounting problem and a rising number of positive tests would inconvenience his reelection prospects. For a narcissist the most immediate personal need is the most important one. So Trump viewed the burgeoning crisis as a threat to him not the nation and he took the steps he usually does in so many circumstances: He denied the threat claimed he knew better than the experts and relied on bluster and BS. He did all that instead of adopting early measures that could have slowed the transmission of the virus. But beyond the narcissism two other fundamental elements of Trump’s character are likely shaping his response: his obsession with revenge and his sense of fatalism. And both are exceedingly dangerous for the American public. Trump has long acknowledged his love affair with revenge. Before Trump ran for president he often gave speeches sharing the supposed secrets to his success. At the top of that list was his devotion to retribution. In 2011 he told the National Achievers Congress in Sydney Australia that there were several lessons not taught in business school that successful people must know. And one of those lessons was this: “Get even with people. If they screw you screw them back 10 times as hard. I really believe that.”In a 2012 speech he offered another version of this:One of the things you should do in terms of success: If somebody hits you you’ve got to hit ’em back five times harder than they ever thought possible. You’ve got to get even. Get even. And the reason the reason you do is so important…The reason you do you have to do it because if they do that to you you have to leave a telltale sign that they just can’t take advantage of you. It’s not so much for the person which does make you feel good to be honest with you I’ve done it many times. But other people watch and you know they say “Well let’s leave Trump alone” or “Let’s leave this one” or “Doris let’s leave her alone. They fight too hard.” I say it and it’s so important. You have to you have to hit back. You have to hit back.In a 2007 speech he noted his first rule of business: “It’s called ‘Get Even.’ Get even. This isn’t your typical business speech. Get even. What this is is a real business speech. You know in all fairness to Wharton I love ’em but they teach you some stuff that’s a lot of bullshit. When you’re in business you get even with people that screw you. And you screw them 15 times harder.”Revenge. It’s often on Trump’s mind. He appears to be constantly fixated on smiting his enemies real or imagined. In an undated video he once declared “I really believe in trashing your enemies.” And he has proudly tweeted about his embrace of revenge quoting Alfred Hitchcock on the subject (“Revenge is sweet and not fattening”) and declaring “‘Always get even. When you are in business you need to get even with people who screw you.’ – Think Big.”Donald J.

When you are in business you need to get even with people who screw you.” – Think Big258410:20 AM - May 3 2013Twitter Ads info and privacy1796 people are talking about thisDuring the coronavirus pandemic Trump has employed his bully pulpit to slam his perceived foes in the media and the political world. He has exploded at reporters who have dared pose tough questions about his response. He even lashed out at a journalist who tossed him a softball. Trump posted a nasty tweet about Mitt Romney the only Republican senator who voted to convict Trump at his impeachment trial when Romney tested negative for the coronavirus. More disturbing Trump has applied his get-even rule to his dealings with governors confronting the crisis. After Washington Gov. Jay Inslee in late February said “Our work would be more successful if the Trump administration stuck to the science and told the truth” Trump struck back. While visiting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention he huffed “I told Mike [Pence] not to be complimentary of that governor because that governor is a snake. So Mike may be happy with him but I’m not OK?” That was Trump getting even. And when Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York noted that the federal government only sent his state 400 ventilators when it needed 30000 Trump responded with a threat. He told Fox “It’s a two-way street they have to treat us well also.” Here Trump was suggesting that complaints from Cuomo would be met with vengeance presumably the withholding of assistance. (It was Trump’s pursuit of revenge that partly landed him in the Ukraine scandal that led to his impeachment. When Trump pressured the new Ukrainian president for bogus investigations he was looking for information that would allow him to retaliate against Ukrainian officials whom he believed without good reason had secretly intervened in the 2016 election to thwart him.)  The revenge-is-sweet wrath of Trump should not be a factor in how the federal government handles the coronavirus. But with a thin-skinned can-never-rise-above-it president who is always bent on revenge at the helm the government’s actions could well be influenced and hindered by this psychological addiction of his. As Trump openly threatened if he is not treated kindly by those dealing with the horrific nightmare underway he will hit back by withholding federal assistance. Remember per Trump’s own top rule for success you have to screw them more than they screwed you. Over the years Trump has also exhibited a troubling fatalism. This has primarily been in regard to the possibility of nuclear war. In a 1990 interview with Playboy he was asked to describe his “longer-term views of the future.” Trump replied “I think of the future but I refuse to paint it. Anything can happen. But I often think of nuclear war.” He then explained that he thought nuclear war was inevitable: “I believe the greatest of all stupidities is people’s believing it will never happen…What bullshit.” In other interviews Trump has indicated nuclear war was likely to occur. On one occasion he noted that because of this he preferred to “really live very much for the present.”In a 2004 interview—again with Playboy—Trump was asked “Do you think Trump Tower and your other buildings will bear your name a hundred years from now?” Trump’s answer was chilling: “No I don’t think so…I don’t think any building will be here—and unless we have some very smart people ruling it the world will not be the same place in a hundred years. The weapons are too powerful too strong.” The odds are Trump was saying that the world would be destroyed. That’s Trump on the subject of nuclear war not a global pandemic. These remarks though do suggest Trump nurtures an overall sense of doom. And might that influence how he views the crisis at hand? In recent days he has blithely talked about soon encouraging people to return to work and normal life even though public health experts say this will lead to a greater spread of the virus and tens of thousands additional deaths. Trump however has raised this troubling notion with a que-sera-sera attitude insisting this course of action would be best to rescue the collapsing economy. His message has been a fatalistic one: Hey we just have to accept this tremendous amount of death so we can start working and shopping again. If you believe the world won’t survive another 100 years that could well make sense.Trump asserts he is a “wartime president.” But an effective commander in chief at war needs to possess certain qualities. He must be able to put national interests ahead of his own. He must unite a nation and transcend political rivalries. He must motivate the citizenry and inspire bravery resilience and hope. A narcissist fixated on revenge who holds a dark and apocalyptic view of the future is not the man for the job. Trump does not have the necessary psychological tools for this mission. To the extent this nation survives the coronavirus attack it will be because governors mayors other local officials and courageous first responders and front-line health care workers beat back the virus and save those American lives they can. Trump cannot be the wartime president Americans require at this horrific moment. He’s not that kind of human being.

306,New Research Suggests the Coronavirus Probably Won’t Vanish in Warm Weather,Molly Schwartz,Mother Jones,-2,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/03/new-research-suggests-the-coronavirus-probably-wont-vanish-in-warm-weather/,A new report out yesterday from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)—the EU’s equivalent of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—suggests that the coronavirus pandemic probably won’t just disappear in the summer months.The report notes that other strains of coronaviruses which cause about 10-15 percent of common colds peak between December and April. They mostly go away in the summer because humidity suppresses respiratory immune defense mechanisms which means the viruses don’t lead to the debilitating respiratory symptoms from which people are dying.     But so far the research does not show that the same is true of the novel coronavirus that’s creating this pandemic. [B]ased on preliminary analyses of the COVID-19 outbreak in China and other countries high reproductive numbers were observed not only in dry and cold districts but also in tropical districts with high absolute humidity such as in Guangxi and Singapore. There is no evidence to date that SARS-CoV-2 will display a marked winter seasonality such as other human coronaviruses in the northern hemisphere which emphasises the importance of implementing intervention measures such as isolation of infected individuals workplace distancing and school closures.This research flies in the face of the claims coming out of the Trump administration. At President Trump’s Fox News coronavirus town hall on Tuesday he sent the message that the coronavirus will abate in the spring months saying it’s possible to have the country “open by Easter.” Trump can't seem to stop talking about his fantasy timeline for the coronavirus—even if it means contradicting his own administration. pic.twitter.com/LK12Dl0EWg— Mother Jones (@MotherJones) March 26 2020Later in the town hall Deborah Birx the response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force made assumptions that this coronavirus will be seasonal:[U]ntil we get through this current pandemic if it has seasonality which we hope and believe it could if it gets through this current season it will be in everybody’s best interest to do as the President has recommended our work on vaccines our work on additional therapeutics and really getting to both pre and post prophylaxis. So that the healthcare providers can get a shot potentially that will protect them we would call it pre-exposure prophylaxis. All of those things are being worked on to prepare us for the next season. So we’re focused today on what we need today and to get through this current epidemic and then we’re also getting prepared in case it comes back in the fall or in case it comes back in the fall of 2021 when we’d have a vaccine.  Anthony S. Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases shot back at President Trump’s “Easter” statement in an interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo yesterday.“You’ve got to be realistic and you’ve got to understand that you don’t make the timeline the virus makes the timeline” said Fauci.
307,ICE Detainees Were Pepper-Sprayed During a Briefing on Coronavirus,Noah Lanard,Mother Jones,-2,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/03/ice-detainees-were-pepper-sprayed-during-a-briefing-on-coronavirus/,For the third time in three days people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement were pepper-sprayed on Wednesday as the coronavirus pandemic raises tensions within immigration jails. All of the pepper-spraying incidents have occurred at detention centers run by the private prison giant GEO Group. ICE spokesperson Bryan Cox wrote in a statement that four people were pepper-sprayed while in a room with 75 other immigration detainees at the LaSalle ICE Processing Center in Jena Louisiana. Cox said these measures were used after the detainees tried to “force their way out of the housing area.”A draft of a court declaration from Mariel Villarreal an immigration attorney at Pangea Legal Services presents a more comprehensive and disturbing picture. Villarreal’s declaration states that the pepper-spraying occurred as women received a presentation about the coronavirus yesterday morning. The declaration is based on a conversation Villarreal had with a client who was one of the 79 women in the room where people were pepper-sprayed on Wednesday. “[My client] informed me that during the presentation the women had questions about the virus and were expressing fears about their safety in the detention center” the attorney wrote in the declaration. “[My client] stated that the women’s questions were going unanswered and their concerns were being ignored by the officers.” (Mother Jones is withholding the client’s name because Villarreal has not yet obtained permission to share it publicly.)The latest use of force comes as immigrants and asylum seekers detained by ICE grow more fearful about being crammed into immigration jails in the midst of a pandemic. On Monday about 60 people were pepper-sprayed at another GEO Group ICE detention center in Texas after they demanded to be released to protect themselves from the virus the San Antonio Express-News reported. ICE announced on Tuesday that a detainee in New Jersey had tested positive for COVID-19 the first confirmed case in its custody. On Wednesday I reported that seven men were pepper-sprayed at GEO Group’s Pine Prairie Louisiana immigration detention center after they refused to go outside because they were fearful of being mistreated by guards while isolated from other detainees. The women believed they were teargassed but Cox said it was pepper spray that was used against them. Villarreal’s declaration continues:[My client] then informed me that the officers grew impatient and angry with the women and released tear gas into the room where they were giving the presentation. The officers promptly left the room and locked the doors.[She] told me that her and the rest of the women were left locked inside the room with tear gas for approximately one hour. She stated that the women were screaming to be let out of the room but no one came to their aid.[She] stated that the women were coughing crying and that some fainted throughout the approximately one hour that they were locked in the room with tear gas.[She] said that after approximately one hour officers came and unlocked the doors and they entered wearing full protective face gear to prevent effects of the tear gas.[She] informed me that as we were speaking her eyes were red and burning and that her whole neck area and throat were in pain.In the middle of our conversation the call was lost and I did not receive a call back from [my client]. I called the ICE Processing Center to attempt to be reconnected with [her] but I was informed that it was not possible at that time.Data released by ICE on Wednesday showed that the number of people in the agency’s custody increased by more than 700 between March 14 and March 21 rising to more than 38000 in total. Health experts and immigrant advocates are calling on ICE to release people from detention who don’t pose a threat to public safety but ICE is refusing to do so.
308,The Surprising Pro-Trumpers Who Took the Coronavirus Crisis Seriously,Stephanie Mencimer,Mother Jones,-2,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/03/coronavirus-mike-cernovich/,On February 25 the pro-Trump internet provocateur Mike Cernovich wrote a blog post titled “Coronavirus is Trump’s Katrina” highlighting some of Trump’s overly rosy tweets about his administration’s response to the epidemic. Top on his list was the February 24 tweet in which Trump said “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. … Stock Market starting to look very good to me!” Then there was the one on February 26 when Trump blamed “fake news” for trying to make the coronavirus look as bad as possible and panic the markets. “USA in great shape!” Trump crowed. In his post Cernovich described Trump and the others who were comparing the coronavirus to the flu as being “moronic and glib.” He wrote “I wonder if they’ve ever had a 104 degree temperature. The flu is awful and in the 2018-2019 flu season 61200 people died. Are we prepared for an additional 60000+ to die from a new strain of flu?” He pointed to early estimates that the coronavirus could kill anywhere from 1.5 million to 5 million Americans. The coronavirus should have been a “slam dunk” for Trump Cernovich wrote a time for Trump to say “This is why we need border security and domestic manufacturing!” Instead Cernovich lamented Democrats had seized the high ground and it was Elizabeth Warren talking about the need to mitigate supply chain impacts from the outbreak in China while Trump was “tweeting some Bush / ‘heckuva job’ b.s.”Coronavirus was a slam dunk for Trump“This is why we need border security and domestic manufacturing!”Instead Democrats are taking the high ground on trade with Elizabeth Warren (!) talking about domestic manufacturing. pic.twitter.com/nFsmtUjNJk— Cernovich (@Cernovich) February 26 2020 The post represented a rare moment of criticism of Trump from one of his own most vocal supporters at a time when the entire GOP establishment including Fox News was marching in lockstep with the president dismissing any concerns about the virus as mass panic fueled by the liberal media to keep him from being reelected. Two days before Cernovich was warning that the coronavirus was Trump’s Katrina right-wing talk radio host Rush Limbaugh told his 25 million listeners “It looks like the coronavirus is being weaponized as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump. Now I want to tell you the truth about the coronavirus…The coronavirus is the common cold folks.”Cernovich is a lawyer filmmaker and blogger who first gained public notice as an agitator in the controversial men’s rights movement where he was known for denying the reality of date rape. “Have you guys ever tried ‘raping’ a girl without using force?” he tweeted in August 2012. “Try it. It’s basically impossible. Date rape does not exist.” Along with his blog he writes self-help books on such things as how to be an “alpha male” including recently MAGA Mindset: Making YOU and America Great Again. He supported Trump “back when everyone said he had a 3 percent ceiling” he told me in an interview. In the midst of the 2016 election his notoriety skyrocketed after he started referring to Hillary Clinton as “Sick Hillary” and implying in Periscope broadcasts blog posts and on social media that she suffered from a severe neurological disorder. His hashtag #HillarysHealth turned the candidate’s physical fitness into a campaign issue. Later during the campaign he helped spread the conspiracy theory that claimed Clinton was involved with a pedophile sex cult housed in the basement of a DC pizza place. A North Carolina man took the conspiracy theory seriously and in December 2016 showed up at the pizza parlor where he fired an assault weapon in the hopes of rescuing the trapped and victimized children. Following Trump’s victory Cernovich helped organize the alt-right inaugural “DeploraBall” in which some of Trump’s most extreme fans gathered to celebrate his election. And he started co-hosting “The Alex Jones Show” on InfoWars the far-right conspiracy theory site.Since then Cernovich’s social media presence has exploded with more than half a million followers on Twitter and more than 400000 on Facebook many of whom are diehard Trump-supporting MAGA people. He’s a regular on the conservative and university talk circuit and last year he released a documentary called Hoaxed billed as an “insider’s look” at “fake news.” But with the coronavirus Cernovich broke with the official White House line. “This bootlicking blind loyalty is not helpful for anyone including Trump” Cernovich told me. I asked him how he went from Pizzagate conspiracy theorist to truth-teller about the coronavirus. He explained that in January he had been hearing about disruptions in the supply chain from China where the virus had hit hard. Friends who worked in e-commerce weren’t able to get anything done and deals were getting delayed. He said he realized then that “China is not going to shut down its economy just because some people had some sniffles.” That’s when he began sounding the alarm launching his first tweets on the subject on January 24 when only 41 people in the world had died from the disease and the US had just two confirmed cases.“I’m not someone who freaks out as we’ve seen so many mass hysterias” he wrote. But “this flu is the real deal.”That day Cernovich tweeted at Trump urging him to add China to his travel ban as a way of slowing the spread of the coronavirus. (On January 31 Trump did just that.) The next day Cernovich tweeted links to stories on the virus from around the globe urging followers to read them. “I’m not someone who freaks out as we’ve seen so many mass hysterias” he wrote. But “this flu is the real deal.” He even wrote an advice column on how to prepare for a pandemic without going crazy long before stores were running out of toilet paper. “It won’t be a ‘Mad Max’ scenario” he assured his fans. “But you may be forced to go days without a food resupply…Forget the Rambo fantasies. Most people don’t need an AR-15. You need a tactical flashlight.” And don’t fall for the gold scams he warned.His followers though didn’t want to hear it. “QUIT THE HYSTERIA. HOW MANY AMERICANS ARE KILLED BY DRUNK DRIVERS IN A YEAR? SCREAM ABOUT THAT” wrote one Trump supporter. Another said “All this panic for nothing. First its [sic] fake news folks second Spring is coming soon and this virus will be gone.” As Cernovich continued to criticize Trump’s response to the epidemic the MAGA crowd pummeled him on social media. Hundreds of people responded to his posts about the virus with angry tweets using similar language accusing him of fomenting panic. Cernovich is no stranger to online abuse but the virus tweets prompted such a surge of so many similar replies that he started to suspect that maybe a pro-Trump super-PAC or dark-money group had launched a bot attack to troll him.QUIT THE HYSTERIA. HOW MANY AMERICANS ARE KILLED BY DRUNK DRIVERS IN A YEAR? SCREAM ABOUT THAT.— lemel KEEP AMERICA GREAT TEXT TRUMP TO 88022 (@gslemel) March 9 2020 After I scrolled through the responses I had to conclude that most of the tweeps hating on Cernovich may just be Fox News viewers parroting people like Sean Hannity who said on his February 27 show that “the Democratic extreme radical socialist party” was “now sadly politicizing and actually weaponizing an infectious disease in what is basically just the latest effort to bludgeon President Trump.” Recent polls show just how far outside of Trumpworld Cernovich has been when it comes to covering the epidemic. An NPR poll taken on March 13 and 14 showed that 54 percent of Republicans believed the coronavirus had been blown out of proportion a number that had doubled since February.Cernovich is not the only voice in the wilderness on the right who’s been bashed by Trump supporters for having told the truth about the coronavirus early on. Raheem Kassam is a co-host of the pro-Trump War Room radio show and podcast with former Trump adviser Steve Bannon. Last month Kassam attended CPAC the largest conservative political conference in the country where an attendee later tested positive for the coronavirus and was hospitalized. When Kassam realized that the sick man had come in contact with a number of high-level public officials at the conference he started tweeting their names including Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) who only days before had scoffed at the seriousness of the virus by wearing a gas mask on the House floor. They both self-quarantined.“Go away. If your whole life is Daddy Trump you’re so not needed.”Trump Vice President Mike Pence and almost half of the administration’s coronavirus task force was at the conference as well where they spent much of their time downplaying the seriousness of the contagion. Former White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said the media was whipping up hysteria over the virus—“They think this will bring down the president that’s what this is all about”—while Pence bragged about all the things Trump was doing to protect American’s health. “We’re ready for anything” he told the gathered faithful.Kassam’s tweets describing the CPAC outbreak spoiled their messaging as he publicized just how close the virus was coming to the White House and how serious it was. Instead of acknowledging that Kassam’s warnings encouraged people to self-quarantine to help slow the spread of the virus Matt Schlapp chair of the American Conservative Union which organizes CPAC ascribed a different motivation. He accused Kassam of having an ax to grind with CPAC. “I’m sorry that Raheem was not included on our speaker schedule” Schlapp said on the podcast Skullduggery on March 10. “And I’m sorry he has a bone to pick with us but using a healthcare moment—where people are worried—to use that to try to stick a stake in my heart was a mistake.”The mainstream GOP response to the virus in its early days was yet another example of just how much Trump has taken over the party. The blind cult-like loyalty among Republican members of Congress left a leadership void that meant that the only meaningful action they took before Trump decided to embrace the role of “wartime president” was apparently to sell off some stock. As long as Trump was insisting that the worst thing about the virus was his media coverage the only people in Trump’s orbit sending up emergency flares about the need to combat the virus were people on the fringes like Cernovich. The conspiracy theorists turned out to be right about the coronavirus. These outliers share something in common beyond a penchant for conspiracy theories and an appreciation for the public health implications of ignoring what would become a pandemic: They all traffic in a visceral disdain for China. Consider Steve Bannon who has been broadcasting a pandemic podcast and radio show since January 25 and who likes to refer to the Chinese Communist Party as “gangsters.”  “The biggest story in the world is not President Trump’s impeachment but a pandemic coming out of China” he said on the first episode. “You may not have an interest in the pandemic but the pandemic has an interest in you.” (And then he brought on Jack Posobiec another Pizzagate conspiracy theorist to talk about it.) On Sunday Bannon went on Fox News and called for a “full shutdown” of the country to go “full hammer on the virus” even as Trump was tweeting about sending people back to work.Or there was Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) a hardcore opponent of immigration who once falsely claimed that George Soros had turned his own family over to the Nazis. Gosar called for a ban on travel from China on January 27. “If #Coronavirus is as contagious as recent reports suggest” he tweeted. “We need @CDCgov & @DHSgov advising Congress and @POTUS on how a quarantine would be implemented.” Gosar ended up having to self-quarantine after being exposed at CPAC.It’s not a coincidence that the only Republican senator to publicly criticize Trump’s response to the pandemic is also the only Republican who voted to impeach him. On February 25 three days before Trump claimed that the virus was going to disappear “like a miracle” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters that the administration wasn’t prepared to deal with the coronavirus. He warned that the country had failed to stockpile critical medical equipment and protective devices that would be needed as the virus spreads in the United States. He called for Trump to appoint a virus czar to coordinate the work needed to halt a pandemic. “I think we should be pulling out all the stops” he said.Trump fans weren’t happy with his assessment. The Gateway Pundit blogger Jim Hoft simply posted Rommey’s comments called him a “NeverTrumper” and wrote “Ugh.” On March 16 when Romney became the first member of Congress to propose sending $1000 payments to help Americans ride out the crisis the only Republican senator to initially endorse the idea was Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) who since January has been parroting conspiracy theories claiming the coronavirus was made in a Chinese bioweapons lab. The failure of the GOP to acknowledge early the threat of a coronavirus epidemic marks a notable shift in Republican politics. After all most “preppers”—the survivalists preparing for the end of the world or coming civil war who’ve got the bugout kits MREs and AR-15s in the basement and all their money invested in gold coins—are conservatives. They have a tendency to freak out about germs especially those that might be transmitted by foreigners. (See Trump and Ebola.) But Trump has upended these dynamics with his ability to strike fear in any Republican who might go off message by threatening to back primary challengers or simply focus his Twitter rage on them. Cernovich who has close ties to the White House—he’s broken news about White House personnel changes—doesn’t much worry about such calculations. On March 11 he did a Periscope broadcast lamenting to his 87000 subscribers that the country had completely botched the virus response. “The lesson here of the coronavirus is we failed the stress test. We learned our infrastructure cannot handle what we face” Cernovich continued. “We the United States of America we still can’t get testing. We still can’t get mass testing.” And he addressed his critics calling the “MAGA conservatives” “losers” who watch bad conservative news and don’t understand math. “Go away” he said. “If your whole life is Daddy Trump you’re so not needed.”He told me he’d rather be accused of overreacting than ignoring the obvious crisis in the works and turning out to be wrong. “I’m widely perceived as a Trump supporter” he said “and it’s up to people widely perceived as Trump supporters to scream at him to do a better job.”
309,It’s Still Too Painful to Put Clothes On: An ICE Detainee Reports He Was Pepper-Sprayed and Sent to Isolation,Noah Lanard,Mother Jones,-2,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/03/ice-geo-detention-pine-prairie-pepper-spray-louisiana/,As Lázaro Siberio-Pérez a Cuban asylum seeker tells me about being pepper-sprayed yesterday by guards at an immigration detention center he is wearing only underwear. His clothes he says are too painful to put back on even now. They remain doused in the “spray” he says switching from Spanish to English and he hasn’t yet been issued another set. Siberio-Pérez is not alone in his pain. Bryan Cox an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman confirms in a statement that seven people were pepper-sprayed on Tuesday at a Pine Prairie Louisiana detention center a for-profit facility run by the private prison giant GEO Group. Tuesday’s use of force comes as tensions build within ICE detention centers across the country and detainees crammed into facilities fear contracting the coronavirus. On Monday about 60 people were pepper-sprayed at another GEO Group ICE detention center in Texas after they demanded to be released to protect them from the virus the San Antonio Express-News reported. ICE announced on Tuesday that a detainee in New Jersey had tested positive for COVID-19 the first confirmed case in its custody. Siberio-Pérez says he hasn’t been given any essential supplies—a toothbrush toothpaste toilet paper—since being transferred to isolation. He says he spent Tuesday night alone and cold.Homero López the executive director of ISLA the legal aid group representing Siberio-Pérez says the Pine Prairie incident began in the afternoon when guards asked the seven detainees to leave their shared cell to go outside. They took it as a sign that something bad was about to happen to them; Siberio-Pérez says that guards take out small groups like this when they want to do things like transfer people to solitary confinement.The detainees refused to go outdoors and people in other cells started to protest when they saw what was happening López says. Guards soon arrived wearing riot gear. Siberio-Pérez says they then hit and pepper-sprayed him and his cellmates. A second Cuban man tells me he couldn’t breathe after being pepper-sprayed adding that he felt like he was burning from within. (Cox says in his statement that the detainees became “physically combative” while refusing to go outside adding that they “became compliant” after pepper spray was deployed.)Jacyln Cole a paralegal at the Southern Poverty Law Center confirms she heard about the episode from another Pine Prairie detainee who called her around 5 p.m. on Tuesday while people were being pepper-sprayed. The man told her he could see about eight guards in riot gear as well as an assistant warden.Most or all of the people who suffered from the pepper spray were then moved into isolation cells which ICE detainees refer to in Spanish as “holes” or “the well.” Siberio-Pérez says he hasn’t been given any essential supplies—a toothbrush toothpaste toilet paper—since being transferred to a two-person cell on Tuesday. At first he was on his own in the cell; he says he spent Tuesday night alone and cold since he couldn’t wear his clothes. (There also aren’t sheets on the beds according to one of the people moved into isolation on Tuesday.) Guards brought a second person a Cuban doctor to join Siberio-Pérez in his cell on Wednesday. Siberio-Pérez says he’s been told he’ll spend one to three months there isolated from the detention center’s general population.This is not the Pine Prairie facility’s first reported incident involving pepper spray and detainees; in August more than 100 people there were pepper-sprayed BuzzFeed News reported at the time. One of those detainees said in a court declaration that the group had been peacefully protesting ICE’s refusal to release them while their cases are pending a practice that a federal judge later found violates the agency’s own parole policy. “[The warden] began spraying our faces with pepper spray from no more than fifty centimeters away from us” the man said in the declaration. “He used so many cans of pepper spray I lost count. Officers continued to throw gas bombs and fire rubber bullets at us from all sides.” Here’s an except from that man’s statement: As the new coronavirus spreads health experts and immigrant advocates are calling on ICE to release people from detention who don’t pose a threat to public safety. ICE has refused to do so. On Wednesday the Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups filed an emergency motion to try to force ICE to identify the people in its custody who are most vulnerable to the new coronavirus so that the agency can come up with a plan to protect them or let them out. Louisiana where the Trump administration has concentrated thousands of asylum seekers is emerging as a new coronavirus hotspot. Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards cited a study on Wednesday showing that Louisiana now has the fastest growing rate of infections out of any state in the US or of any country. “There is no reason to believe that we won’t be the next Italy” he said.Some of López’s clients at Pine Prairie told him they saw people in hazmat suits remove a detainee a few days ago. One of the dorms at the detention center remains under quarantine López says though ICE has declined to tell López if the quarantine is related to the coronavirus. When I asked Cox about it last week before the latest pepper-spray episode he replied in general terms. “Cohorting” he wrote using ICE’s term for quarantines “is being done at multiple facilities to preclude the potential spread of COVID-19.”Siberio-Pérez who is 28 says he was a wrestling coach and physical education teacher in Cuba. He entered the United States to request asylum in April by coming to an official border crossing. Like another Cuban asylum seeker I spoke to earlier this month he compares the detention that’s followed to a kidnapping. “This is a kidnapping” he says. “We are kidnapped by ICE.”
310,In California confusion over what businesses qualify as 'essential',Dennis Romero,MSNBC,-2,https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/california-confusion-over-what-businesses-qualify-essential-n1170031,"After most businesses in California were closed under a ""Stay at Home"" order by Gov. Gavin Newsom on March 19 to prevent the spread of coronavirus many proprietors didn't always know who was exempt.So some cannabis shops gun stores call centers and others remain open for business as owners wonder whether they are skirting the law.The state has the most retailers in the nation with one in four workers based at a real or virtual storefront according to the California Retailers Association. The shutdown impacts not only their paychecks but those of others along the supply chain said association president Rachel Michelin.""It is a little bit of a challenge in terms of the essential versus the nonessential"" she said. ""We’ve been seeking clarity from the governor's office and haven’t received a response.""The confusion over which businesses are essential is most acute with gun stores many of which stayed open after the stay-at-home order went into effect despite no mention of them being exempt.Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villaneuva said this week that he would begin shutting down firearms retailers while the sheriff of San Diego County the fifth largest in the nation said he's not closing them in his county because they provide a ""valuable public service.""A group of plaintiffs including the National Rifle Association sought Friday to block the L.A. County closures by filing suit in Los Angeles federal court against Villanueva and Newsom. The government may not impose ""deprivation of constitutional liberties during a time of crisis"" the suit argues.Meanwhile Sam Paredes executive director of Gun Owners of California said his group would ask ""the Department of Homeland Security to declare that gun dealers and the gun industry are an essential business in a time in crisis.""Marijuana retailers in the city of Los Angeles also kept their doors open despite an initial lack of clarity from the governor who didn't mention them in his order.By March 21 state and local officials said licensed cannabis stores could stay open.""All cannabis businesses and the supply chain that services them are all deemed 'essential'"" said L.A. shop owner Jerred Kiloh director of the United Cannabis Business Association.The next day the state public health officer said marijuana stores some of them medically licensed would be protected as part of the public health sector.Ambiguity crossed other types of stores as well.""You sit at a strip mall and see the Home Depot open and a Stein Mart is not"" Michelin said.California-based RH formerly known as Restoration Hardware closed its stores but said some back-end employees in the state are still at work.""We are continuing to operate critical parts of our business such as our call centers"" RH said in a statement that cited critical infrastructure activity listed by the state.Joann fabric and craft stores said locations would stay open for pickup and its ""classrooms"" would host projects inviting volunteers to make ""essential items"" for medical workers including masks and gowns.Texas-based video game retailer GameStop initially argued that because it sold electronics it could help people telecommute during isolation. But it later announced it would temporarily shutter all stores not already closed.The New York Times reported this week that California-based music instruments chain Guitar Center still had stores open and that some customers were trying out gear and then returning it to shelves.""All Guitar Center California stores closed either before or at the time requested by government authorities"" the retailer responded by email.Former U.S. Attorney Harry Litman a Southern California resident and host of the ""Talking Feds"" podcast wrote in the Los Angeles Times that the governor's stay-at-home order was ""something of a mess.""He said in a later interview that he would not be surprised if some businesses took the state to court over the shutdown. But he acknowledged no civil courts would be open anytime soon to hear challenges.""I’m not criticizing the governor per se"" he said. ""I think he exhibited leadership in coming forward quickly. There’s just a lot of questions."""
311,'I operate on the data and on the numbers': Cuomo responds to Trump ventilator claims,Dareh Gregorian,MSNBC,-2,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/i-operate-data-numbers-cuomo-responds-trump-ventilator-claims-n1170636,"Andrew Cuomo is pushing back on President Donald Trump's assertion that New York doesn't need the tens of thousands of ventilators the governor has requested to meet the coronavirus health crisis.In an interview on Friday with ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt Cuomo said of the president ""I hope he's right.""""I hope no one gets sick"" Cuomo said. ""I hope no one needs a ventilator. But — I don't operate on what I hope or what I would like to see or what my expectation is. I operate on the data and on the numbers and on the science. And every projection I have from multiple sources and these are worldwide health experts say that we have to be prepared for an apex of 140000 hospital beds and 40000 ICU beds with ventilators.""On Thursday night Trump said he was skeptical of Cuomo's request telling Fox News' Sean Hannity in a telephone interview that he had ""a feeling"" some states were asking for more equipment than they needed.""I don't believe you need 40000 or 30000 ventilators"" Trump said.Cuomo told NBC News ""That's a numerical projection from the rate of increase. My job is to follow that science follow that data. I hope they're wrong. I hope I don't need 40000. I hope I don't need 30000.""The interview was conducted in Manhattan's Jacob K. Javits Convention Center which the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has converted into a 1000-bed hospital.""I hope this whole facility Lester stays empty and we built it for nothing"" Cuomo said.While Cuomo a Democrat and Trump have generally been complimentary of each other during the coronavirus crisis Cuomo was critical earlier this week after FEMA arranged to send just 400 ventilators to New York City.""You want a pat on the back for sending 400 ventilators when we need 30000?"" Cuomo told reporters on Tuesday. Trump fired back during a Fox News town hall where he complained Cuomo ""should have ordered the ventilators"" years earlier so the state would have been better prepared.Vice President Mike Pence said later Tuesday that another 4000 ventilators were being sent to New York. Those ventilators were the source of another spat between Trump and the governor's office Friday. Trump complained on Twitter that the highly coveted equipment had been put into storage. ""N.Y. must distribute NOW!"" Trump wrote.Cuomo's top aide Melissa DeRosa tweeted in response that the respirators the state has received so far have been ""deployed to the strategic stockpile."" ""We don't know which hospitals will have the need yet — this is evolving in real time"" she added.

Currently men who have sex with men must remain celibate for a year before they are permitted to donate.The 15 senators sent a letter to the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday urging authorities to “shift away from antiquated and stigmatizing donation policies” to address a need for blood donations during the outbreak of COVID-19 the disease caused by the coronavirus.“We must take every possible step to secure our nation’s blood supply in this critical time” the senators wrote advocating for donation policies that are “scientifically sound based on individual risk and inclusive of all potential healthy blood donors.”As of March 16 the American Red Cross reported that social distancing and self-isolation to prevent coronavirus’ spread had resulted in the cancellation of 2700 blood drives and 86000 fewer donations. During a March 19 briefing of President Donald Trump’s coronavirus task force Surgeon General Jerome Adams called on all Americans to address this critical shortage by giving blood saying that “one donation can save up to three lives.”Under regulations put into place in 2015 gay and bisexual men must refrain from sex for a year before they are permitted to donate blood. These guidelines which were instituted under the Obama administration replaced a 1983 rule that banned any man who engaged in sexual contact with another man from donating for life. That policy had been a relic of the early days of the AIDS epidemic when little was known about the disease or how to test for it.While the senators said the shortening of the deferral window to 12 months was a step forward they argue that the current requirements don’t reflect “important advances in blood screening and safety technology” that have been made since 2015. As NBC News previously reported the presence of HIV can now be detected in the bloodstream within a week of transmission.That 15 lawmakers added that “a time-based deferral policy is not scientifically sound continues to effectively exclude many healthy gay and bisexual men and does not meet the urgent demands of the moment.”Sen. Tammy Baldwin D-Wisc. the first out LGBTQ person elected to Congress spearheaded the letter. Other signatories include Cory Booker of New Jersey Sherrod Brown of Ohio Kamala Harris of California Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders of Vermont.In a statement Baldwin said she has “long fought to end discriminatory blood donation policies” as a federal lawmaker. She led similar pushes from the Senate calling on the FDA to rethink its blood donation policies in 2014 and 2016.“The COVID-19 pandemic has created a nationwide blood shortage and we must work to increase our nation’s supply based on science and facts” she told NBC News. The FDA “needs to change their discriminatory blood donation policies to address this challenge and help save lives.”

Rex Parris said the 17-year-old had been sick for a few days and had no previous health conditions.""The Friday before he died he was healthy. He was socializing with his friends"" Parris said. ""By Wednesday he was dead.""Parris said the teen went to an urgent care March 18.""He did not have insurance so they did not treat him"" Parris said adding the boy was sent to a hospital.En route he went into cardiac arrest according to the mayor. When the teen got to the hospital he was revived and kept alive for six hours. But it was too late the mayor said.""We've learned that once you go into respiratory issues you have trouble breathing you're short of breath and you have a fever that is the time to get medical treatment without delay"" Parris said.The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health initially said the teen died from COVID-19 the disease caused by the coronavirus but later backtracked. In a statement Tuesday public health officials said his death will require further evaluation by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.""Though early tests indicated a positive result for COVID-19 the case is complex and there may be an alternate explanation for this fatality"" the statement said. ""Patient privacy prevents our offering further details at this time.""Parris did not immediately return a request for an interview Friday.NBC News was referred by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's Office to the county's office of emergency management for comment on the teen's cause of death. A spokesman said a cause of death would be determined by the CDC.More than 4000 cases of the coronavirus had been reported in California as of Friday afternoon."
314,White House advisers push Trump to avoid more date-specific timelines,Carol E. Lee Kristen Welker and Monica Alba,MSNBC,-2,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-advisers-push-trump-avoid-more-date-specific-timelines-n1170771,WASHINGTON — As President Donald Trump approaches his administration's benchmark for slowing the spread of the coronavirus in the United States some of his advisers are urging him not to set another one according to multiple people familiar with the discussions.There is growing concern among Trump’s aides that his push for opening up even just parts of the country by a specific date will backfire these people said not only on Americans broadly but also on the president politically. Trump’s insistence in recent days on setting specific timelines for responding to the pandemic has at times put him at odds with his public health team as well as his political advisers who now see his re-election chances as wholly dependent on his handling of the pandemic.“How Trump handles this is going to be the determinative factor in his re-election” said one of the people familiar with the internal discussions. “Most of what happened in the three years until now is irrelevant. It’s going to be how he responded to this.”Trump’s 15-day “slow the spread” initiative which ends Monday is seen by some of his allies as a cautionary exercise exposing the pitfalls of setting expectations around specific dates given the numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths have since become worse and not better the people familiar with discussions inside the White House said. They said aides have repeatedly urged the president not to speak in terms of dates.Yet Trump has become so hyper concerned about a deep recession — and the toll that would take on his re-election prospects in November — these people said that his economic and public health teams are scrambling to engineer a plan that meets his latest expectations: getting some Americans to return to work and school by Easter while curtailing the pandemic.“We are working hard on various metrics: geography testing hospital capacity hot spots and cold spots” a senior administration official said describing the president’s April 12 benchmark as “aspirational.” Vice President Mike Pence also said Friday when referring to the Easter timeline that “the president expressed really an aspirational goal.”The effort to meet that goal is being forged amid competing views of how to approach the crisis including a deluge of outside advice the people familiar with the discussions said. It’s further complicated they said by a dynamic in which some aides are supportive of the Easter timeframe but others are deeply doubtful that a feasible plan exists or believe attempting it is not worth the political risk.White House officials downplayed any potential divisions within the president’s team but acknowledged the difficulties of confronting this crisis.“Every day is a week” the senior administration official said. “We’re slogging through this.”Trump is expected to receive recommendations this weekend for how to adopt an approach under which the government would lift restrictions for individual counties across the country depending on their level of coronavirus risk. Critics of the idea have said it won’t work because any current numbers of cases are incomplete or don’t give a full picture of a county’s risk.Internal deliberations over setting a deadline for when Americans’ lives could start getting back to normal began in earnest in the middle of last week according to people familiar with the discussions. Trump pushed the discussions just days after his aides had convinced him he needed to appear more presidential as a leader waging a war.Trump initially agreed and publicly appeared to defer to public health experts. But he quickly soured on the strategy telling advisers it wasn’t changing the economic outlook or criticism that he’d botched the coronavirus response.“After two or three days he got tired of it because the media narrative didn’t get better” one person familiar with the discussions said.Around the same time business leaders and some of the president’s supporters began raising questions about the shutdown of American life saying the economy could suffer historic lows.Trump told aides he wanted to lift government restrictions and get the economy back up and running within one or two weeks. Some officials thought that was too soon and suggested he wait at least until Easter with the hope that pushing back the date would buy them time to better assess the spread of the virus and get a plan in place.The White House did not respond to requests for comment.As Trump deals with the biggest crisis he has faced as president his frustrations with his public health advisers have increased.Those frustrations boiled over last weekend after Dr. Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases made plain his disagreements with Trump during a series of news interviews that drew widespread media attention.“Trump was furious” one person familiar with the matter said.Publicly however some allies of the president have defended Fauci and Trump’s relationship arguing it was the media trying to create a rift between the two men. And a senior administration official said “there is no division” between Trump and his team of public health experts.Yet conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh a Trump ally appeared to reflect any frustrations the president has saying Friday“We didn’t elect a president to defer to a bunch of health experts that we don’t know.”The problem the president’s public health and political advisers now share the people familiar with the internal discussions said is that Trump doesn’t just want optimism that the crisis will pass in a matter of weeks to be the White House message he wants it to be the reality.Pence has tried to mediate between the president’s expectations and the recommendations from public health officials on the White House’s Coronavirus Task Force at times during meetings smoothing over differences between the two sides. He’s also seemed to play that role publicly.When asked Friday on CNBC about opening up parts of the country again Pence noted “that the president said he would love to see it around Easter but whenever that day is that we can responsibly begin to open up portions of the country.”“But let me be very clear” Pence added. “There's going to be areas of the country where we need to continue to lean into mitigation efforts.”

Indian American chef Asha Gomez told The New York Times this week how Cardoz had influenced her career.""I remember walking into that restaurant and feeling this sense of pride that I had never felt as an Indian” Gomez said. “To see what he had done to elevate Indian cuisine to the likes of French cuisine — because it deserves to be in that same light — was at the time mind-blowing to me.”Tributes have poured in for Cardoz who died after admitting himself into a hospital on March 17 as a precautionary measure when he returned from a trip to Bombay India and felt feverish.Originally from Bombay and raised in Goa Cardoz first rose to prominence in the United States after the New York Times gave his restaurant Tabla three stars. He went on to win the culinary competition television show “Top Chef Masters” in 2011 and opened two restaurants in India: Bombay Canteen and O Pedro.Indian American food writer Priya Krishna wrote about the last time she saw Cardoz at a dinner he was hosting and how he paved the way for Indian cuisine in America.""Looking back I wish that at that dinner I had told him that even if he never opens another restaurant that Indian dining in America would not look like what it does today without him"" Krishna wrote in Vogue India. ""That Indian restaurants get to be high-end and personal and regional and cross-cultural and succeed on a large scale—we can in large part thank Floyd Cardoz.""As one of the first Indian chefs in the United States Cardoz often expressed a desire to bring Indian cooking to the mainstream. In a recent appearance on the TV show ""Ugly Delicious"" he spoke about trying to break through the stereotype that Indian food can’t be high-end.""Indians have to tell the story that our food is f–--ing amazing” Cardoz said in the show. “It doesn't have to be thought of as pedestrian or cheap. We want to show you things that we eat here all the time.""The host of ""Ugly Delicious"" and the founder of the Momofuku restaurant group David Chang spoke about the lasting legacy of Cardoz in the Asian American restaurant scene.""Floyd was a legend"" Chang said in his podcast ""The Dave Chang show."" ""Floyd was in the Pantheon of highly influential chefs that changed the game. So many of us cook the way we do because of his influence.""His newest venture Bombay Sweet Shop opened in early March. The shop which features classic Indian sweets from all parts of India is currently closed until further notice.Throughout his career Floyd was dedicated to lifting up South Asian chefs. Meherwan Irani the founder of Chai Pani Restaurant Group wrote about his first time meeting Cardoz for Bon Appetit Magazine.""I thanked this man I’d never met for changing my life and blazing a trail that I and so many other Indian chefs have followed"" Irani wrote. ""The acceptance and legitimacy that we all craved and finally gained was because of him. I called Floyd the godfather of modern Indian cuisine.""Padama Lakshmi the host of ""Top Chef"" echoed this sentiment in an Instagram post on Tuesday. ""Floyd made us all so proud” Lakshmi wrote. “This is a huge loss not only for the professional food world but for Indians everywhere.”His colleagues at Bombay Sweet shop wrote a tribute to Cardoz on Instagram referring to him as ""Papaji"" meaning father in Hindi.“You showed us what it means to live life to the fullest and be the best versions of ourselves all the time"" the post read. “You believed in the vision and in us more than we ever did and pushed us to be confident and proud in whatever we do.”"

It acknowledged that the review was “limited in certain respects by legal restrictions on the disclosure of sensitive information.”NBC News reported in October 2019 that AnyVision's technology has powered a classified military surveillance project that has monitored Palestinians in the West Bank. The project was so successful that AnyVision won Israel's top defense prize in 2018 for preventing ""hundreds of terror attacks"" using ""large amounts of data.""Human rights activists argued that AnyVision's work monitoring Palestinians in the West Bank was incompatible with its public statements about ethical standards for facial recognition technology.“After careful consideration Microsoft and AnyVision have agreed that it is in the best interest of both enterprises for Microsoft to divest its shareholding in AnyVision” said Microsoft in a statement. “For Microsoft the audit process reinforced the challenges of being a minority investor in a company that sells sensitive technology since such investments do not generally allow for the level of oversight or control that Microsoft exercises over the use of its own technology.”Microsoft also announced a global change to its investment policy to end minority investments in companies that sell facial recognition technology to give the company “greater oversight and control over the use of sensitive technologies” according to a statement released Friday."

Queens has seen the most cases with more than 8200 and the most deaths too at more than 120. Brooklyn was next with 6750 cases and more than 80 deaths as of Friday.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was setting up a temporary field hospital at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan.On Friday morning Gov. Andrew Cuomo asked the federal government to approve four additional field hospitals throughout the city.“I want to have one for each borough” he said.In the meantime the Queens doctor said some patients who were more stable and did not need ventilators but still needed other forms of treatment should be transported to other hospitals.“There's no staffing to care for so many people” the doctor said. “There's a window of time where we know they need to be admitted they need oxygen not ventilators so they’re still stable to be transported.”Earlier this week a high-ranking medical staffer at NewYork-Presbyterian Queens told The City an online news outlet: “Our plan from a week ago is out the window. We need help.”“We’re drowning here and it’s getting worse by the day” the staffer said.Outside Elmhurst Hospital Center one of the most overwhelmed hospitals in Queens some people on Thursday said they waited for hours in a line wearing masks to be tested for the virus.Ignacio Ramirez told NBC News from a distance that he had waited five hours.“I don't know what's going to happen” said Ramirez who began feeling symptoms on Sunday.""I have a fever a terrible headache. It doesn't stop"" he said. “I feel very weak. It's horrible.""Alicia Ramirez waited in line with her 15-year-old son so he could get tested.“I'm really scared. I have a little boy at home too so I don't want none of them to get it” she said.Inside Elmhurst doctors have described overfilled waiting rooms patients waiting six hours to be seen others packed closely together on stretchers waiting 50 to 60 hours for a bed and doctors desperately trying to get more ventilators.Doctors have said the facility has been overwhelmed for weeks as coronavirus cases continue to climb.This week 13 people died of the virus in one day.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio asked President Donald Trump Friday afternoon to ""keep Elmhurst hospital in mind"" and that as the virus continues to spread ""tomorrow it's going to be another hospital.""""The doctors and nurses at Elmhurst Hospital are giving it their all right now"" the mayor said on Twitter earlier Friday. ""We’re laser-focused on keeping them supplied with what they need. Yesterday we sent more ventilators and staff. Today we sent 8000 N95 masks 18000 head covers and 2000 booties. More is on the way.""NYC Health + Hospitals the city’s public hospital system did not immediately respond to request for comment on transporting coronavirus patients to other hospitals.The hospital system said in a previous statement to NBC News it was “working day and night to ensure that all our patients receive the care they need.”There were more than 1000 ventilators across the system and NYC Health + Hospitals was receiving an additional 400 from the city’s office of Emergency Management it said.The hospital system said it had ""adequate supplies at the moment but are fully cognizant of the nationwide scarcity of resources"" and that ""reports of lack of personal protective equipment and ventilators in our system are false.""“The public health system is working with all local state and federal agencies to ensure that resources are strategically allocated throughout to accommodate the surge caused by COVID-19” the hospital system said. “We are committed to our mission to care for all New Yorkers regardless of immigration status and ability to pay and are focused on keeping all our patients and staff safe.”In a statement Wednesday the hospital system said Elmhurst hospital was “at the center of this crisis and it’s the number one priority of our public hospital system right now.”“The front-line staff are going above and beyond in this crisis and we continue surging supplies and personnel to this critical facility to keep pace with the crisis” it said."

320,Does Elizabeth Warren Have a Critical Vulnerability?,Paul Starobin,The New York Times Opinion,-2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/opinion/elizabeth-warren-massachusetts.html,ORLEANS Mass. — I have voted two times for Elizabeth Warren to represent Massachusetts in the Senate. I would certainly vote for her for president over Donald Trump. But as the Democratic primary unfolds and she extends a steady rise in the polls I keep coming back to a political vulnerability of which many followers of Massachusetts politics are aware but others may not be.The problem is that she has a relatively weak standing in Massachusetts with non-college-educated working-class voters and especially white workers. These voters are critical especially in the Midwest and in states crucial to Mr. Trump’s victory like Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.You might call it the Warren Paradox. Her core message as a politician — that America has become rigged in favor of the very wealthy and the rich get richer as the rest of us get shafted — is very much aimed at the working class. What’s more her personal narrative of her rise from “the ragged edge of the middle class” in her native Oklahoma as she has put it to professional success and acclaim in the fields of education and government might seem to embody a character trait of grit that appeals to blue-collar workers.Yet while all of the major Democratic presidential candidates face difficulty with this constituency polls suggest that this is especially a problem for Ms. Warren. For example in a Fox survey she drew 33 percent of white non-college respondents in a matchup against President Trump versus 38 percent for Joe Biden and 37 percent for Bernie Sanders. For Democrats to feel fully confident about nominating Ms. Warren as their standard-bearer she needs to figure out this puzzle.In Massachusetts the Warren Paradox can be glimpsed in towns like Rockland population near 18000 a suburb about 20 miles south of Boston overwhelmingly white and working class. In her November 2018 Senate race against a pro-Trump Republican Ms. Warren won 60 percent of the vote statewide but only 44 percent of the vote in Rockland. By contrast northwest of Boston in the upscale suburb of Lexington where the median home value is $1.15 million (compared with $340000 in Rockland) Ms. Warren took 74 percent of the vote.On a recent visit to Rockland I encountered a sentiment that her policies to address economic hardships might actually penalize those who have played by the rules. In a conversation in the parking lot of a McDonald’s a young mother after depositing her two children into the back seat of her car said she viewed as unfair Ms. Warren’s proposal to forgive college student loans for most people carrying such debt. Now a manager at a local restaurant she said she had attended a technical institute after high school and duly paid off her loans. “Probably” she told me she would vote for Mr. Trump for delivering on his promise to create more jobs.I also came across what certainly sounded like although it was not overtly expressed reluctance to embracing her because she is a woman. “I can’t even listen to her. I just shut it off” — the television — “when she comes on” a man at Uptown’s Finest Barbershop told me.In part Ms. Warren is afflicted by an authenticity problem with these voters. A former Harvard law professor she is viewed by some whatever her declared agenda as typical of an elite that is out of touch with the concerns of ordinary working people. Doubts about her genuineness are nourished by her claim of Native American ancestry — which her detractors in Massachusetts have long framed as a dubious attempt to elevate her career prospects over equally qualified white job candidates. In 2012 Scott Brown her Republican opponent in her first Senate race tried to use this issue against her.These misgivings feed a conviction that she doesn’t have Rockland’s back — a belief common to white non-college voters often held against the Democratic Party in general. “She’ll tax me” insisted a 49-year-old high school graduate who works at a town agency. (Ms. Warren’s proposed wealth tax targets only households with assets exceeding $50 million.)Editors’ PicksThe Toilet Paper Had Armed Guards and Other Coronavirus Stories4 Bright Spots Amid the Gloom of CoronavirusWoody Allen’s New Memoir Is Sometimes Funny — and Tone Deaf and Banal“She wants to have open borders” he added voicing another reason that some people in Rockland think a President Warren won’t protect them. (Like a number of the Democratic presidential candidates Ms. Warren is in favor of decriminalizing unauthorized border crossings.) And the sense that Ms. Warren who has voted in Congress for a ban on assault weapons is soft on gun rights also plays into the notion that she would leave Rockland unprotected. The 49-year-old voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 and fully plans to do so again in 2020 with the “good job” the president is doing on the economy. (After speaking to me he climbed into a car with a National Rifle Association sticker affixed to the back windshield.)As Ms. Warren’s Senate campaigns attest she is by no means uniformly unpopular in Rockland or for that matter in neighboring communities with a similar socio-economic profile.“I love Elizabeth Warren” said a welder and member of a plumbers union local age 68 by phone. “She’s my bulldog. She is 100 percent for us — for the working man the exploited person the underdog.” He is from Weymouth next door to Rockland. “If she were a man they would love her.” He paused. “Or they would like her more.”As he explained places like Rockland on the South Shore of Massachusetts need to be understood as products of “white flight” from Boston following court-ordered school busing in the mid-1970s.Should she win the Democratic nomination it’s easy to see the difficulties she will face in gaining the allegiance of the white working class in a matchup with Mr. Trump. White flight also defines a number of working-class suburbs in the Midwest as in the metropolitan Detroit region.But even though the Warren Paradox will be a real challenge she still has the opportunity to impress potentially unreceptive voters with her “bulldog” tenacity as in her visit this year to a small town in West Virginia to talk about the opioid crisis — a state 93 percent white taken by Mr. Trump in 2016 by nearly 42 points. She has also put gut economic issues at the centerpiece of her agenda: For instance her “Plan for Economic Patriotism” an industrial-policy tack calling for such steps as “more actively managing” the currency value of the dollar “to promote exports and domestic manufacturing” and a tenfold increase in government spending on job apprenticeship programs won praise from the Fox News commentator Tucker Carlson. “It’s just pure old-fashioned economics: how to preserve good-paying American jobs” he told his audience a form of “economic nationalism.”And to be sure while white working-class voters get a great deal of attention in battleground states like Michigan if Democrats can increase turnout among African-American voters in 2020 that would help counterbalance any weakness among white working-class voters.As I was reminded in Rockland the task of beating Mr. Trump doesn’t require passion for the president’s challenger whoever that may be. The president too arouses a visceral dislike among some people there. One man a Vietnam veteran who works at the American Legion post in Rockland screwed up his face at my mention of the president. Among the things he finds unappealing is Mr. Trump’s disdainful posture toward the news media. We chatted about the fractious state of American politics at the Rockland Bar and Grill as he sipped his Guinness. “If it’s down to Trump and Warren it’s definitely Warren” he declared without hesitation. Ms. Warren versus Mr. Trump would be a grind but that it might be said is the story of her life.
321,When Is Impeachment Not Impeachment?,The Editorial Board,The New York Times Opinion,-2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/opinion/impeachment-trump.html,To clarify: The House Judiciary Committee has begun an inquiry to determine whether to recommend the impeachment of President Trump. The effort has been underway since March 4 when the committee announced it would look into “the alleged obstruction of justice public corruption and other abuses of power” on the part of the president. Last Thursday committee members passed a resolution setting the parameters for the investigation “to determine whether to recommend articles of impeachment.” On Tuesday the panel began what its chairman Representative Jerry Nadler has said will be an “aggressive series of hearings” to this end.This does not mean that the committee will necessarily recommend impeachment. But Mr. Nadler’s team is working to establish whether that step makes sense.Unfortunately there is tremendous confusion about what the Judiciary Committee is up to — largely because of conflicting signals from House Democrats who have been struggling with their public statements on impeachment. Mr. Nadler has said repeatedly that his committee is engaged in an impeachment investigation — or if you prefer an impeachment inquiry. He insists the “nomenclature” does not matter. The House speaker Nancy Pelosi and her leadership team clearly disagree. They assiduously avoid the “I” word painting the committee’s work as garden-variety oversight.As a result even Democratic lawmakers don’t seem to know whether they are engaged in an impeachment inquiry. Representative Pramila Jayapal has said “yes.” Representative Jim Himes has said “no.” Last week Steny Hoyer the House majority leader said “no” — then backtracked claimed he’d misheard the question and offered a non-answer instead.This is more than semantic hairsplitting. It is a reflection of the Democrats’ divisions over the wisdom of impeaching Mr. Trump. Advocates of impeachment are eager to play up and skeptics to play down the possibility of the Judiciary Committee’s work leading in that direction. Need to Impeach the advocacy group founded by the Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer called Thursday’s resolution vote a “pivotal moment.” The speaker’s camp characterized it as non-news. At her Thursday news conference Ms. Pelosi bristled when reporters pressed her on whether an impeachment investigation was underway. The conference was “gathering facts” as it had been doing for months and would make a decision “when we’re ready” she said. “That’s all I have to say about this subject.”Complicating matters in attempting to wrest documents and testimony from a White House committed to stonewalling Democrats have argued in court filings that they are already engaged in an impeachment inquiry. (Some legal experts contend that impeachment proceedings — versus ordinary investigations — could strengthen Democrats’ hand in such scuffles.) So even as the leadership and other skeptics insist there’s nothing unusual going on Democrats’ court filings cite an existing impeachment inquiry.Republicans have waded into the mix arguing that impeachment investigations of past presidents required an authorization vote by the full House. Democrats counter that the rules have been changed such that the committee already possesses the investigatory powers that authorization once conferred making a vote unnecessary.You can see why people might be confused.But the muddled messages are creating their own problems and threatening to undermine the push for presidential accountability. The contradictory statements make Democrats look divided and conflicted complicating efforts to build public confidence in their oversight powers. Representative Tom McClintock a Republican has mocked the Democrats’ strategy as “You can have your impeachment and deny it too.”More concretely the Department of Justice is using Democrats’ ambiguity to argue that the administration need not hand over information sought by congressional investigators. “Most prominently the speaker of the House has been emphatic that the investigation is not a true impeachment proceeding” the department contended in a court brief filed Friday.Editors’ PicksThe Toilet Paper Had Armed Guards and Other Coronavirus Stories4 Bright Spots Amid the Gloom of CoronavirusWoody Allen’s New Memoir Is Sometimes Funny — and Tone Deaf and BanalThe Democratic leadership should try to find a way forward that at the very least doesn’t leave members contradicting one another and further embolden Mr. Trump. Consider having members defer on the question to Mr. Nadler’s committee which can reply truthfully that the panel is uncovering the facts and will decide how to proceed based on those facts.As the Judiciary Committee’s hearings begin fresh attention will fall on its investigation. This exercise is about more than politics; it is about safeguarding the health of our democracy. Democrats need to clarify to the public — and to themselves — where they are headed.
322,Why an Assault Weapons Ban Hits Such a Nerve With Many Conservatives,Will Wilkinson,The New York Times Opinion,-2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/opinion/assault-rifle-ban.html,“Hell yes we’re going to take your AR-15 your AK-47” Beto O’Rourke exclaimed at last week’s Democratic debate. The gathered crowd was enthusiastic about the proposal but other Texans were … less receptive.One — Briscoe Cain a Republican state legislator from the Houston exburbs — responded with an ominous tweet: “My AR is ready for you Robert Francis” (addressing Mr. O’Rourke by his given name).Mr. O’Rourke first brought up the mandatory buyback idea shortly after August’s string of mass shootings. Several well-known conservative commentators met the proposal with a series of warnings exposing chilling and increasingly open hostility to majoritarian democracy on the right.“So this is — what you are calling for is civil war” Tucker Carlson of Fox News said of Mr. O’Rourke’s comments. “What you are calling for is an incitement to violence.” On ABC’s “The View” Meghan McCain maintained that “the AR-15 is by far the most popular gun in America by far. I was just in the middle of nowhere Wyoming. If you’re talking about taking people’s guns from them there’s going to be a lot of violence.” On Twitter the conservative writer Erick Erickson said: “I know people who keep AR-15’s buried because they’re afraid one day the government might come for them. I know others who are stockpiling them. It is not a stretch to say there’d be violence if the gov’t tried to confiscate them.”Bear in mind a critical point: A buyback law could not take effect without approval from majorities in both houses of Congress and endorsement by the president. This is all but impossible without unified Democratic control of government; in fact because our electoral system puts Democrats at a forbidding structural disadvantage especially in the Senate Democrats would need to command overpowering supermajority support to turn such a proposal into law.In that light all of these ominous “there will be violence” warnings clearly imply that it simply doesn’t matter whether or not mandatory buyback legislation is enacted by duly elected representatives of the American people with an extraordinary popular mandate because the wildly outvoted minority would nevertheless be right to regard the law as an intolerable injustice that warrants retaliatory violence. Just ask them.The likes of Erick Erickson jamming a cocked finger into his jacket pocket and pointing it at democracy may not strike terror in your heart. But the seditious principle behind these blustering elliptical threats is genuinely alarming.Democracy is what we do to prevent political disagreement from turning into violent conflict. But the premise of Trumpist populism is that the legitimacy and authority of government is conditional on agreement with the political preferences of a shrinking minority of citizens — a group mainly composed of white Christian conservatives.Who you may sensibly ask granted Tucker Carlson’s target demographic veto power over the legislative will of the American people? Nobody. They got high on their own supply and anointed themselves the “real American” sovereigns of the realm. But their relative numbers are dwindling and they live in fear of a future in which the law of the land reliably tracks the will of the people. Therein lies the appeal of a personal cache of AR-15s.Editors’ PicksThe Toilet Paper Had Armed Guards and Other Coronavirus Stories4 Bright Spots Amid the Gloom of CoronavirusWoody Allen’s New Memoir Is Sometimes Funny — and Tone Deaf and BanalWeapons of mass death and the submissive fear they engender put teeth on that shrinking minority’s entitled claim to indefinite power. Without the threat of violence what have they really got? Votes? Sooner or later they won’t have enough and they know it.Nearly every Republican policy priority lacks majority support. New restrictions on abortion are unpopular. Slashing legal immigration levels is unpopular. The president’s single major legislative achievement tax cuts for corporations and high earners is unpopular.Public support for enhanced background checks stands at an astonishing 90 percent and 60 percent (and more) support a ban on assault weapon sales. Yet Republican legislatures block modest popular gun control measures at every turn. The security of the minority’s self-ascribed right to make the rules has become their platform’s major plank because unpopular rules don’t stand a chance without it. Float a rule that threatens their grip on power no matter how popular and it’s “my AR is waiting for you Robert Francis.”They’ll tell you their thinly veiled threats are really about defending their constitutional rights. Don’t believe it. The conservative Supreme Court majority’s 2008 decision in District of Columbia v. Heller found an individual right to own guns for self-protection but no civilian needs a weapon capable of shooting 26 people in 32 seconds to ward off burglars. The Second Amendment doesn’t grant the right to own one any more than it grants the right to own a surface-to-air missile.They’ll tell you their foreboding “predictions” of lethal resistance are really about preserving the means to protect the republic against an overweening rights-stomping state. Don’t believe that either. It’s really about the imagined peril of a multicultural majority running the show. Many countries that do more to protect their citizens against gun violence are more not less free than we are. According to the libertarian Cato Institute 16 countries enjoy a higher level of overall freedom than the United States and most of them ban or severely restrict ownership of assault weapons. The freedom to have your head blown off in an Applebee’s to flee in terror from the bang of a backfiring engine might not be freedom at all.I’m not too proud to admit that in my misspent libertarian youth I embraced the idea that a well-armed populace is a bulwark against tyranny. I imagined us a vast Switzerland hived with rifles to defend our inviolable rights against … Michael Dukakis? What I slowly came to see is that freedom is inseparable from political disagreement and that holding to a trove of weapons as your last line of defense in a losing debate makes normal ideological opposition look like nascent tyranny and readies you to suppress it.So it’s no surprise that the most authoritarian American president in living memory elected by a paltry minority is not threatened in the least by citizen militias bristling with military firepower. He knows they’re on his side.Democrats don’t want to grind the rights of Republicans underfoot. They want to feel safe and think it should be harder for unhinged lunatics to turn Walmarts into abattoirs. But when minority-rule radicals hear determined talk of mandatory assault rifle buybacks they start to feel surrounded. They hear the hammers clicking back imagine themselves in the majority’s cross hairs.That’s why they’re unmoved by the mounting heap of slaughtered innocents by schoolkids missing recess to rehearse being hunted. It’s a sacrifice they’re willing to let other Americans make because they think democracy’s coming for their power and they’re right.
323,The Changing Shape of the Parties Is Changing Where They Get Their Money,Thomas B. Edsall,The New York Times Opinion,-2,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/opinion/trump-fundraising-donors.html,Money is the mother’s milk of politics as the old saying goes and the slow motion realignment of our two major political parties has changed who raises more money from the rich and who raises more from small donors.A pair of major developments give us a hint about how future trends will develop on the partisan battleground.First: Heading into the 2020 election President Trump is on track to far surpass President Barack Obama’s record in collecting small donor contributions — those under $200 — lending weight to his claim of populist legitimacy.Second: Democratic candidates and their party committees are making inroads in gathering contributions from the wealthiest of the wealthy the Forbes 400 a once solid Republican constituency. Democrats are also pulling ahead in contributions from highly educated professionals — doctors lawyers tech executives software engineers architects scientists teachers and so on.These knowledge class donors deeply hostile to Trump propelled the fund-raising success of Democratic House candidates in 2018 — $1 billion to the Republicans’ $661 million.While there are advantages for Democrats in gaining support from previously Republican-leaning donors this success carries costs. In winning over the high-tech industry the party has acquired a constituency at odds with competing Democratic interest groups especially organized labor and consumer protection proponents. Picking up rich backers also reinforces the image of a party dominated by elites.In their paper “Increasing Inequality in Wealth and the Political Expenditures of Billionaires” Adam Bonica and Howard Rosenthal political scientists at Stanford and N.Y.U. track the partisan contribution patterns of the Forbes 400 from the 1981-82 election cycle through the 2011-12 cycle.For that three-decade period the level of giving to Republicans and Republican Party committees by members of the Forbes 400 followed a steady downward trajectory falling from 68 percent to 59 percent.This downward trajectory coincided with the steady transformation of the sources of wealth for those on the Forbes list. In 1982 when the list was first published solidly Republican manufacturers and energy producers dominated — 89 of the 400 richest Americans having made their fortunes in oil.By 2018 59 of the Forbes 400 had made their fortunes in technology including six of the top ten: Jeff Bezos No. 1; Bill Gates No. 2; Mark Zuckerberg No. 4; Larry Ellison No. 5; Larry Page number 6; and Sergey Brin number 9. Eighty-eight more made their money in the financial sector. In contrast to the 1982 Forbes list only 14 on the 2018 list made their money in manufacturing and 24 in energy.“The 400 have trended steadily to the left” conclude Bonica and Rosenthal.The two authors write that from 1989 to 2017 members of the Forbes 400 have fared much better under Democratic presidents than Republican presidents: The 400 “did very well under the two Democrats Clinton and Obama. They did not do well under either Bush.”Bonica and Rosenthal’s analysis may prove troubling for those seeking to slow or reverse increasing wealth and income inequality. As the Forbes 400 moves toward the Democratic Party they write “Inequality in campaign contributions in the American plutocracy has grown hand in hand with the growth in economic inequality.”They go on to raise another basic question: Does increased support for Democrats among the affluent and the rich undermine efforts to stem the growth of inequality?The historic rise in inequality in recent decades has not ushered in an era of Republican fund-raising dominance. On the contrary Democrats have made substantial gains against Republicans in recent decades while inequality was on the rise.In a separate essay published on the Scholars’ Strategy Network which discusses the implications of their work Bonica and Rosenthal wrote:The superrich control resources that parties and politicians require and as a result are courted. Politicians have incentives to pay attention to the policy concerns that animate wealthy donors on left and right alike — and this dynamic influences public discussion and policymaking.The continued concentration of money at the top they write translates into more political power:The ideas values and preferences of wealthy donors distort the focus of U.S. democracy more than individuals’ desires to grow their already vast fortunes. Rather than worry about individual corruption citizens and leaders should worry about the many ways money in politics can amplify the voices of the privileged few over those of the majority. As wealth concentration grows so will uneven political influence.Bonica has turned tracking campaign contributions by wealth and occupation into a specialty.He provided The Times with data extending from 1980 to 2016 covering the contribution patterns of donors who gave the largest amount of money in each election cycle. (Roughly a quarter of Bonica’s list overlaps with the Forbes 400 list.)In the 1979-80 presidential election cycle 71 percent of the top 400 donors gave to Republicans and to right-of-center political action committees while 29 percent gave to Democrats and left-of-center PACS a 42-point difference. In the 2015-16 presidential cycle 54 percent gave to Republicans and right-leaning PACs and 46 percent gave to Democrats an 8-point difference.In the case of contribution patterns of those in different occupations Bonica emailed in response to my inquiry:The medical profession has perhaps experienced the largest generational realignment. Physicians who graduated medical school before the 1990s tend to favor Republicans but younger cohorts have trended sharply to the left.Bonica’s data shows that doctors who graduated in the 30 years from 1960 to 1990 consistently gave more to Republicans than to Democrats generally in the 54-55 percent range.Starting with those graduating in the 1990 however the share of contributions going to Republicans began to decline dropping below 50 percent for those graduating in 1996 and falling to the low 30s for the youngest cohort.As further evidence of this trend Bonica cited a 2017 survey of 1660 medical students published in the journal Academic Medicine. The survey reported that 89.1 percent said they supported Obamacare. In the survey 77.7 identified themselves as liberal 12.2 percent moderate and 7.2 percent conservative.Bonica’s study of lawyers conducted with Maya Sen a political scientist at Harvard also demonstrates a strong pro-Democratic trend in campaign contributions although attorneys have leaned Democratic for decades.On an ideological scale — with plus numbers indicating right-of-center and minus numbers indicating left-of-center — Bonica found that lawyers who graduated from nonelite schools shifted from roughly evenly split between left and right in the 1950s to minus .6 or liberal by 2012. Lawyers from elite schools (Harvard Stanford Yale etc.) were liberal leaning in the 1950s (minus .25) and became rock solid liberals by the current decade (minus .9).Three different scholars — David E. Broockman and Neil Malhotra professors at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business and Gregory Ferenstein an independent journalist who writes about Silicon Valley — have a different take. Their paper “Predispositions and the Political Behavior of American Economic Elites: Evidence from Technology Entrepreneurs” explores some of the political consequences of the ascendance of high-tech.Technology entrepreneurs despite their Democratic leanings are ambivalent on key elements of the Democratic agenda according to Broockman and his co-authors. They are reliably orthodox liberals on some issues not so reliable on others.On matters of globalization trade and immigration this Silicon Valley constituency is firmly pro-globalization. Eighty seven percent support free trade agreements and 56 percent are “in favor of increasing levels of immigration” which is “15 points higher than Democratic” rank and file the paper says.On social issues the authors found that “technology entrepreneurs are again very liberal” including near universal (96 percent) support of same-sex marriage 82 percent support of gun control and 67 percent opposition to the death penalty.Perhaps most significant and most surprising surveys of high tech executives conducted by Broockman and colleagues show that tech entrepreneurs “strongly support redistribution and taxation.” For example Broockman et al. continue “nearly all technology entrepreneurs support increasing taxes on those making over $250000 or $1000000 per year (with 76 and 83 percent expressing some support for each respectively).” Seventy five percent support programs specifically targeted toward the poor including 59 percent in support of increased spending for the poor. Some 82 percent indicated “support for universal health care even if it means raising taxes.”While high tech executives share the views of liberal elites generally on the issues described above there are significant areas of conflict.“Technology entrepreneurs do not share conventional Democratic views on the regulation of product and labor markets” the authors write. “Technology entrepreneurs are indeed more conservative even than Republican citizens and most similar to Republican donors.”On specific issues almost all (82 percent) tech executives believethat it is too difficult to fire workers and that the government should make it easier to do so. However majorities of Democratic donors and citizens believe the government should make it harder to fire workers (a 50 percentage point difference from technology entrepreneurs).In the case of organized labor three quarters (74 percent) of tech executives “say they would like to see labor unions’ influence decrease versus only 18 percent of Democratic donors and 33 percent of Democratic citizens.”In their conclusion the three authors address how the growing influence of the tech industry in Democratic politics will affect the party’s approach to social spending and the reduction of inequality.On one hand they write “technology entrepreneurs seem poised to support Democratic candidates — and therefore redistributive policies that should reduce inequality — financially.”On the other they point out that these entrepreneursgenerally stand opposed to many government interventions in markets — such as government support for labor unions worker protections and consumer protections — that have long been central to the Democratic Party’s ideological answer to inequality and supported by traditional Democratic constituencies.The result they suggest is thatas Democratic elected officials receive increasing financial support from technology entrepreneurs and attempt to court further support from them” intraparty conflicts over “regulating product and labor markets may take center stage.Altogether the developments at the high-end of campaign finance are a mixed bag for the Democratic Party expanding the sources of political money while simultaneously risking internal divisions.More worrisome for the Democratic Party and its candidates is Donald Trump’s exceptional success in raising campaign money in small dollar amounts which suggests that his racial and anti-immigrant rhetoric continues to motivate supporters.Federal Election Commission data on Barack Obama’s 2012 campaign and Hillary Clinton’s 2016 bid along with an analysis of Trump’s fund-raising in the 2020 campaign by the Center for Responsive Politics shows the following.By the end of his re-election campaign Obama raised a total of $549.4 million of which $234.4 million or 42.7 percent came in contributions of less than $200.By the end of her 2016 campaign Clinton raised a total of $405.7 million of which $105.6 million or 26.0 percent came in low dollar amountBy the end of June 2019 at a much earlier stage in his campaign Trump had raised a total of $124.8 million of which $87.3 million or 70.0 percent is made up of donations under $200.Brian Schaffner a political scientist at Tufts wrote in an email that “Trump’s appeal is more to ideologues and emotional Republican contributors rather than to strategic and traditional Republican large dollar donors.”He argues thatthe fact that Trump raises such a large share from small dollar donors is due less to Trump’s improvement among small donors than it is to the difficulty he has raising money from large donors. This is really a story about how the traditional large donors in the Republican Party didn’t want to give to Trump in 2016 and even so far in 2020 they continue to be reluctant to contribute to him.Raymond J. La Raja a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst also emailed me:It is not too surprising that Trump has outpaced others even Obama in raising money from small donors. Individual donors — big and small — tend to be much more polarized compared to the rest of the electorate. They give because of strong ideological preferences and passions. People like Trump ignite those passions.Bonica notes that “there is a strong association between ideological extremity and total funds raised from small donors at the presidential level.” Bonica’s calculations of the ideological positioning of the candidates shows that Trump is “the most extreme conservative” while Bernie Sanders who “raised 58 percent of his campaign dollars from small donors” in 2016 stands out as the most liberal candidate “which might mirror what we see in Trump from the left.”Trump’s success in raising small dollar contributions is not necessarily a harbinger of his prospects in November 2020. It does however raise a question about the contemporary role of the two major political parties.Traditionally one of the core strengths of the Democratic Party has been that voters trust it more than the Republican Party to protect and advance the interests of the middle class. In recent years however that advantage has been eroding.The NBC/WSJ poll has repeatedly asked voters “which party do you think would do a better job looking out for the middle class?”In the 1990s an average of eight polls showed the Democrats with a 22.25 point advantage 43.0 to 21.75. The question was dropped only to be resumed in December 2011. From 2011 to September 2014 the Democratic advantage fell to 19.5 points 44.0 to 24.5.Since then in six surveys conducted from June 2015 to October 2018 — the Trump era — the Democratic advantage continued to erode to 13.1 points 41.3 to 28.2. In the two most recent surveys the Democratic advantage fell to 10 points 41 to 31 less than half of what it was in the 1990s.The Democrats may or may not regain the presidency in 2020 but they could well lose their invaluable credential as the party of the middle class.
324,Should Biden Freak Out About the Trump Bump?,Frank Bruni,The New York Times Opinion,-2,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/opinion/coronavirus-trump-polls-approval.html,Every day at the White House briefing about the coronavirus Donald Trump gets the undivided attention of the media a national television audience bloated by crisis and as many minutes as he wants to play a “wartime president” as he grandiosely calls himself. Never mind that he flubs his lines and turns tragedy into farce. He’s the star. His billing communicates that he’s in command.And every day Joe Biden watches from the far reaches of the upper balcony as he waits and waits to be declared the de facto Democratic presidential nominee and assume leadership of his party. The coronavirus has postponed state primaries prolonged the contest yanked him out of the news and left him in political limbo where he wonders if Bernie Sanders will ever acknowledge defeat and shivers in the shadow of another Democrat Andrew Cuomo who didn’t even run for president.There was never any doubt that this pandemic would scramble November 2020 but how much — and how? At first all the great oracles augured Trump’s long-delayed reckoning and his certain demise given his hemming his hawing his lying and his economy which was suddenly in tatters. This was it. He’d finally met his undoing. It couldn’t have happened to a more cavalier guy.But over the past two weeks that prophecy has changed — or at least turned cloudier. In recent polls his approval rating ticked upward. His disapproval rating inched downward. There’s talk of a “Trump bump” an appallingly cute phrase for an unthinkably dire development. Now more than ever it’s hard to fathom four more years of this president.Do we need nonetheless to fathom it? As usual some pundits are getting ahead of themselves. November remains far away and all of Trump’s happy talk won’t matter if the virus rages on and the dying doesn’t stop. There are reasons — ephemeral ones — that a slight warming of some voters toward Trump right now was inevitable.But it’s also true that Biden has for the moment been dealt a remarkably frustrating hand.It’s not that social distancing has separated him from voters and forced the cancellation of traditional rallies and town halls. As Alex Wagner pointed out in The Atlantic his astonishing resurrection in and after the Democratic primary in South Carolina wasn’t achieved through barnstorming and radiant charisma; it was the consequence of an established brand an excellent relationship with black voters and a quickly spreading recognition among all Democrats that they needed to rally around a plausible adversary for Trump and Biden made as much sense as any other candidate.So Biden’s forced estrangement from the campaign trail per se isn’t the issue. But what of his inability to hold in-person fund-raisers? It’s more difficult to rake in the dough when you can’t press the flesh and donations will surely be diminished by the plunge in the Dow the rise in unemployment and the general financial panic.And what of his struggle to have a significant presence in the news? He’s doing his best. On Tuesday alone he made virtual appearances from his Delaware home on three television talk shows. He just began a newsletter announced an imminent podcast and held an online news conference and an online happy hour with voters.But had the pandemic not happened he might now or very soon be allowed to act as the nominee-in-waiting feeding the news cycle by planting rumors about his emerging vice-presidential short list or about potential cabinet picks. State primaries that were pushed back — Georgia’s is a prime example — might have given him a delegate lead so huge that Sanders was forced to cry uncle.Instead Sanders is sending the signal that his battle presses on by calling for another debate. Sanders holdouts and Biden-skeptical progressives are undercutting Biden by circulating videos of his most awkward recent interview moments a pattern of behavior vividly documented by The Washington Post’s David Weigel. In his terrific newsletter “The Trailer” he noted that an MSNBC clip of Biden “was featured on ‘Rising’ The Hill’s populism-branded morning show in a segment titled ‘Biden CRASHES AND BURNS in multiple TV appearances.’” One of the show’s hosts Krystal Ball said to viewers “Just ask yourself is that the man that you want leading this response and this crisis right now?”Biden has been restrained but Trump is unbound. At a time when tens of millions of Americans have been ordered to stay home when some of the distractions that they’d normally turn to are canceled or off-limits and when they have their television sets on Trump is preening and pontificating for hours on end.On Tuesday between a Fox News town hall a subsequent interview on that cable channel with Bill Hemmer and then the daily briefing he dominated the airwaves for the entire afternoon. On Thursday he zipped from the briefing to an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox where you’ll be shocked to learn his handling of the coronavirus is characterized in heroic terms.“It doesn’t matter that at least half of what he’s saying is at best wrong and at worst encourages people to do the wrong things” Bob Kerrey the former governor of Nebraska and senator told me. “He’s the leader. And the media is basically doing what it did in 2016 and giving the reality-TV star what he wants.”“The longer this goes on” Kerrey said “the more likely he gets re-elected.”To most of the president’s detractors that assessment is mystifying: How can his abundant misstatements of fact delusional optimism and painful failure to pantomime empathy amount to an advantage?They ask: What about the way Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx have been forced at those briefings to tweak the president’s message and correct some of his remarks?Well you notice that mostly if you’re skeptical and paying a kind of pointillist attention focusing on the dots. What many Americans do is pull back and see the larger gauzier picture and that’s of the president surrounded by serious people who are under his command. While Fauci Birx and some others are there to make sure that rationality and expertise are injected into Trump’s decisions — and should be commended for that — they wind up sanitizing and upsizing him. Call it accidental validation.There’s something additional to consider: Trump’s minimization of the crisis looks different to different areas of the country. It looks most appropriate in places that haven’t recorded many cases of coronavirus infection yet which happen to be some of the same places that voted for him.“There’s a great swath of the country that is experiencing more what Donald Trump is describing than what you and I are experiencing” Beth Myers a prominent Republican consultant and longtime senior adviser to Mitt Romney told me. (Her home where she’s sheltering in place is in the Boston area.) “Their lives are going on while the economy is cratering” she said. “Now that may change but right now it’s an urban-centered crisis. How does the person in rural Wisconsin think about everything? My guess is that they think that Donald Trump has the right tone: We have to take this seriously but not let it stop the country.”In light of that I’d expect a more impressive Trump bump especially because there’s a long history of Americans’ rallying around the leader during a national crisis when they’re emotionally invested in believing that they’re in sturdy hands. George W. Bush’s approval rating soared above 80 percent after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.But in polls released over recent days Trump’s approval ratings ranged from 45 percent to 50 percent. Yes those were high for him but in a period when the country has a motive for giving him the benefit of the doubt shouldn’t those highs be even higher? In the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls late Friday morning Trump’s disapproval rating 49.3 percent still eclipsed his approval rating 47.3 percent.That’s why Biden shouldn’t freak out too much. Trump may have a captive audience but he’s still a captive of his own profound limitations.
325,The Road to Coronavirus Hell Was Paved by Evangelicals,Katherine Stewart,The New York Times Opinion,-2,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/opinion/coronavirus-trump-evangelicals.html,Donald Trump rose to power with the determined assistance of a movement that denies science bashes government and prioritized loyalty over professional expertise. In the current crisis we are all reaping what that movement has sown.At least since the 19th century when the proslavery theologian Robert Lewis Dabney attacked the physical sciences as “theories of unbelief” hostility to science has characterized the more extreme forms of religious nationalism in the United States. Today the hard core of climate deniers is concentrated among people who identify as religiously conservative Republicans. And some leaders of the Christian nationalist movement like those allied with the Cornwall Alliance for the Stewardship of Creation which has denounced environmental science as a “Cult of the Green Dragon” cast environmentalism as an alternative — and false — theology.This denial of science and critical thinking among religious ultraconservatives now haunts the American response to the coronavirus crisis. On March 15 Guillermo Maldonado who calls himself an “apostle” and hosted Mr. Trump earlier this year at a campaign event at his Miami megachurch urged his congregants to show up for worship services in person. “Do you believe God would bring his people to his house to be contagious with the virus? Of course not” he said.Rodney Howard-Browne of The River at Tampa Bay Church in Florida mocked people concerned about the disease as “pansies” and insisted he would only shutter the doors to his packed church “when the rapture is taking place.” In a sermon that was live-streamed on Facebook Tony Spell a pastor in Louisiana said “We’re also going to pass out anointed handkerchiefs to people who may have a fear who may have a sickness and we believe that when those anointed handkerchiefs go that healing virtue is going to go on them as well.”By all accounts President Trump’s tendency to trust his gut over the experts on issues like vaccines and climate change does not come from any deep-seated religious conviction. But he is perfectly in tune with the religious nationalists who form the core of his base. In his daily briefings from the White House Mr. Trump actively disdains and contradicts the messages coming from his own experts and touts as yet unproven cures.Not every pastor is behaving recklessly of course and not every churchgoer in these uncertain times is showing up for services out of disregard for the scientific evidence. Far from it. Yet none of the benign uses of religion in this time of crisis have anything to do with Mr. Trump’s expressed hope that the country would be “opened up and just raring to go by Easter.” He could of course have said “by mid-April.” But Mr. Trump did not invoke Easter by accident and many of his evangelical allies were pleased by his vision of “packed churches all over our country.”“I think it would be a beautiful time” the president said.Religious nationalism has brought to American politics the conviction that our political differences are a battle between absolute evil and absolute good. When you’re engaged in a struggle between the “party of life” and the “party of death” as some religious nationalists now frame our political divisions you don’t need to worry about crafting careful policy based on expert opinion and analysis. Only a heroic leader free from the scruples of political correctness can save the righteous from the damned. Fealty to the cause is everything; fidelity to the facts means nothing. Perhaps this is why many Christian nationalist leaders greeted the news of the coronavirus as an insult to their chosen leader.In an interview on March 13 on “Fox & Friends” Jerry Falwell Jr. the president of Liberty University called the response to Coronavirus “hype” and “overreacting.” “You know impeachment didn’t work and the Mueller report didn’t work and Article 25 didn’t work and so maybe now this is their next ah their next attempt to get Trump” he said.Editors’ PicksThe Toilet Paper Had Armed Guards and Other Coronavirus Stories4 Bright Spots Amid the Gloom of CoronavirusWoody Allen’s New Memoir Is Sometimes Funny — and Tone Deaf and BanalWhen Rev. Spell in Louisiana defied an order from Gov. John Bel Edwards and hosted in-person services for over 1000 congregants he asserted the ban was “politically motivated.” Figures like the anti-L.G.B.T. activist Steve Hotze added to the chorus denouncing the concern as — you guessed it — “fake news.”One of the first casualties of fact-free hyper-partisanship is competence in government. The incompetence of the Trump administration in grappling with this crisis is by now well known at least among those who receive actual news. February 2020 will go down in history as the month in which the United States in painful contrast with countries like South Korea and Germany failed to develop the mass testing capability that might have saved many lives. Less well known is the contribution of the Christian nationalist movement in ensuring that our government is in the hands of people who appear to be incapable of running it well.Consider the case of Alex Azar who as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services has had a prominent role in mismanaging the crisis. It seems likely at this point that Mr. Azar’s signature achievement will have been to rebrand his department as the “Department of Life.” Or maybe he will be remembered for establishing a division of Conscience and Religious Freedom designed to permit health care providers to deny legal and often medically indicated health care services to certain patients as a matter of religious conscience.Mr. Azar a “cabinet sponsor” of Capitol Ministries the Bible study group attended by multiple members of Mr. Trump’s cabinet brought with him to Health and Human Services an immovable conviction in the righteousness of the pharmaceutical industry (presumably formed during his five-year stint as an executive and lobbyist in the business) a willingness to speak in the most servile way about “the courage” and “openness to change” of Mr. Trump and a commitment to anti-abortion politics abstinence education and other causes of the religious right. What he did not bring evidently was any notable ability to manage a pandemic. Who would have guessed that a man skilled at praising Mr. Trump would not be the top choice for organizing the development of a virus testing program the delivery of urgently needed protective gear to health care workers or a plan for augmenting hospital capabilities?Or consider Ben Carson the secretary of Housing and Urban Development a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force and another “cabinet sponsor” of Capitol Ministries. As a former pediatric neurosurgeon Mr. Carson brought more knowledge about medicine to his post than knowledge about housing issues. But that medical knowledge didn’t stop him from asserting on March 8 that for the “healthy individual” thinking of attending one of Mr. Trump’s then-ongoing large-scale campaign rallies “there’s no reason that you shouldn’t go.”It is fair to point out that the failings of the Trump administration in the current pandemic are at least as attributable to its economic ideology as they are to its religious inclinations. When the so-called private sector is supposed to have the answer to every problem it’s hard to deal effectively with the very public problem of a pandemic and its economic consequences. But if you examine the political roots of the life-threatening belief in the privatization of everything you’ll see that Christian nationalism played a major role in creating and promoting the economic foundations of America’s incompetent response to the pandemic.For decades Christian nationalist leaders have lined up with the anti-government anti-tax agenda not just as a matter of politics but also as a matter of theology. Ken Blackwell of the Family Research Council one of the Christian right’s major activist groups has gone so far as to cast food stamps and other forms of government assistance for essential services as contrary to the “biblical model.” Limited government according to this line of thinking is “godly government.”When a strong centralized response is needed from the federal government it doesn’t help to have an administration that has never believed in a federal government serving the public good. Ordinarily the consequences of this kind of behavior don’t show up for some time. In the case of a pandemic the consequences are too obvious to ignore.
326,D.J.T. Is No F.D.R.,Jamelle Bouie,The New York Times Opinion,-2,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/opinion/trump-coronavirus-new-deal.html,The coronavirus pandemic may plunge the United States into its worst social and economic crisis since the Great Depression. But our response — from the president’s blame-shifting rhetoric to the Senate’s inadequate relief package — has yet to rise to the scale and scope of the challenge.I’ve written before about why Congress needs to do far more than it has if it wants to save the economy from disease-induced depression. Here I want to focus on rhetoric. If the country needs a New Deal-esque effort to stop the pandemic then it also needs New Deal-esque leadership to mobilize manpower and resources to that end.It’s with this in mind that I want to look to Franklin Roosevelt’s first inaugural address. Elected in November 1932 Roosevelt was well aware of a deep national hunger for leadership — for someone to bring energy to government and confront an economic crisis that threatened the entire social order.Roosevelt was inaugurated on March 4 1933. The day was gray and grim. “Though the city was gay with flags and lively with the music of bands and cheers for the marchers in the inaugural parade which followed the oath taking” Arthur Krock wrote in The New York Times “the atmosphere which surrounded the change of government in the United States was comparable to that which might be found in a beleaguered capital in wartime.”For good reason. “In the agonizing interval between Roosevelt’s election in November 1932 and his inauguration in March 1933 the American banking system shut down completely” and “the global economy slid even deeper into the trough of the Depression” the historian David M. Kennedy writes in “Freedom From Fear: The American People in Depression and War 1929-1945.” In “The Crisis of the Old Order” the first of his three volumes on Roosevelt and the New Deal Arthur Schlesinger Jr. described the situation as a “fog of despair.”“One out of every four American workers lacked a job” he wrote:Factories that had once darkened the skies with smoke stood ghostly and silent like extinct volcanoes. Families slept in tarpaper shacks and tin-lined caves and scavenged like dogs for food in the city dump.Schlesinger continued:Thousands of vagabond children were roaming the land wild boys of the road. Hunger marchers pinched and bitter were parading cold streets in New York and Chicago.Americans didn’t just hurt in the present; they feared for the future. “Hope proved elusive” the historian Ira Katznelson writes in “Fear Itself: The New Deal and the Origins of our Time:”The rumble of deep uncertainty a sense of proceeding without a map remained relentless and enveloping. A climate of universal fear deeply affected political understandings and concerns. Nothing was sure.Rather than avoid or ignore that fear Roosevelt used his first words as president to face it head on. “A host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of existence and an equally great number toil with little return. Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment” he said. And yet he continued the nation’s distress “comes from no failure of substance” before adding “We are stricken by no plague of locusts.” Instead Americans face poverty and deprivation because “the rulers of the exchange of mankind’s goods have failed through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence.”To be fair Roosevelt said these men “have tried.” But their efforts “have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition.” In the face of a devastating crisis they did more of the same. “They have no vision and where there is no vision the people perish.”Thankfully those men were now gone from the scene. “The money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization” Roosevelt said. “We may now restore that temple to the ancient truths.” And what are those truths? It is the truth that “happiness lies not in the mere possession of money” but in the “joy of achievement in the thrill of creative effort.” It is the truth that “the joy and moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of evanescent profits.”For Roosevelt the nation needed a change in ethics: an “abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit” and “an end to conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing.” At the same time the country also needed immediate relief. To that end he asked Americans to treat the challenge of unemployment and idle production “as we would treat the emergency of a war.”This meant an end to the timid policies of the past and the orthodoxy that constrained Washington in the face of crisis and the start of a new energetic approach to wielding the powers of the federal government. Roosevelt called for “direct recruiting by the government itself” to relieve unemployment and “direct efforts to raise the values of agricultural products” to prevent “the tragedy of the growing loss through foreclosure of our small homes and farms.” He called for “unifying of relief activities” and “national planning for and supervision of all forms of transportation and of communications and other utilities which have a definitely public character.” And he insisted that all of this is “feasible under the form of government which we have inherited from our ancestors.” The Republic was under stress but it hadn’t been broken.As Roosevelt neared the end of his address he returned to the language of ethics as well as the language of war:If I read the temper of our people correctly we now realize as we have never realized before our interdependence on each other; that we cannot merely take but we must give as well; that if we are to go forward we must moved as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline.The American people craved leadership and Roosevelt delivered it taking center stage in the nation’s political life and holding it for the next 12 years. Still it would be another two years before his legislative program matched his rhetorical ambitions. It was the so-called second New Deal of the Social Security Act and the National Labor Relations Act that fundamentally altered the federal government’s relationship to its citizens.The larger point however is this: It took more than competence and ability to resolve the crisis of the 1930s. President Herbert Hoover was competent (in the early 1920s he spearheaded a relief effort that saved millions of Russians from starvation in the wake of famine and civil war); Hoover was able. But Hoover was committed to a failed orthodoxy unable to think beyond the dogma of the past. Roosevelt wasn’t a blank slate but he was flexible. He could think creatively about government and his allies were eager to experiment. They brought openness and imagination to Washington and helped save the country in the process.As we face what may become the great crisis of our age we need that Rooseveltian leadership: flexible creative and deeply aware of the power of words. Roosevelt’s first inaugural wasn’t just an impressive speech; it was a harbinger of things to come. Like nearly all of the most memorable presidential rhetoric it cleared the way for action pointing the country toward a singular goal. Put another way the Roosevelt of March 1933 did not know how the future would unfold but he understood the power he had to shape the limits of what was possible — and he didn’t hesitate to put it to work.
327,On Coronavirus We’re #1,Paul Krugman,The New York Times Opinion,-2,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/opinion/trump-coronavirus.html,It’s hard to believe but just a month ago Donald Trump and his henchmen were dismissing the coronavirus as a nonevent. On Feb. 26 Trump declared that “You have 15 people and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be close to zero.” His remark came a day after Larry Kudlow his administration’s chief economist declared that the virus was almost completely contained and that the economy was “holding up nicely.”There are now more than 82000 cases in the U.S. — we don’t know how many more because we’re still lagging far behind on testing. But that makes us the world’s coronavirus epicenter and the U.S. trajectory is worse than that of any other country.As for the economy: Last week more than three million workers filed for unemployment insurance a number that is completely off the scale even as many others who are suddenly out of work aren’t eligible for unemployment benefits. We’re clearly losing jobs even faster than at the worst moments of the 2008-9 financial crisis when we were losing “only” 800000 per month.Trump’s dismissal and denial played a large role in getting us to this point. And he should be held accountable. But the crucial question now is whether we’re doing enough to cope with the catastrophe.And the answer is no. We’re doing some of what we should be doing mainly thanks to the efforts of Democratic governors and Democratic members of Congress — a statement that may sound partisan but is the simple truth. But we’re still falling down on crucial fronts mainly because even now Trump and his party aren’t taking the threat seriously.What should we be doing? Three main things.First we need an all-out push to get essential medical equipment to where it’s needed. This means everything from face masks and other personal protective equipment for health care workers to ventilators for critical patients. It also of course means a vast expansion of testing.The multiple weeks we wasted thanks to Trump’s virus denial have put us far behind the curve and thousands of Americans will die unnecessarily as a result. But a full-court press could still make a huge difference.Unfortunately that’s still not happening. Trump has the power to mobilize industry to produce crucial equipment but he has refused to use that power airily declaring that “we’re not a shipping clerk.”Actually we don’t want him to be a shipping clerk. We want him to be a traffic cop directing resources to where they’re needed most — a role the federal government has always played in wartime which the current crisis most resembles.But he won’t take responsibility so we’re now seeing a chaotic scramble that will surely kill thousands more.Second we need to slow the virus’s spread by reducing personal contacts that might lead to new infections — “social distancing.” The good news is that a number of states have taken strong action closing nonessential businesses banning almost all gatherings and issuing shelter-in-place orders to stop people from going out. And early indications are that these actions are working.The bad news is that Trump is calling for the United States to “reopen” by Easter a move nearly all public health experts believe would be catastrophic. Clearly he still doesn’t take the pandemic seriously. And some Republican governors share his fecklessness. For example Ron DeSantis Florida’s governor is still refusing to close the state’s beaches.So crucial measures to slow the pandemic’s spread are partial and the president is offering the opposite of leadership. But much of the country is doing the right thing despite Trump.Which brings me to the third thing we need to do: Provide financial aid to families and businesses in the face of an unavoidable economic contraction. What we’re seeing in those surging unemployment claims isn’t a conventional recession; it’s more like a medically induced coma done for the patient’s own good — which is why Trump’s desire to get people back to work is lethally misguided. But people need to eat even while they can’t work.So two cheers for the $2 trillion legislation the Senate just passed. People keep calling it a “stimulus” bill but that’s not what it really is. Instead it’s mainly disaster relief: checks to families enhanced unemployment benefits aid to hospitals and hard-pressed states and loans to help small businesses survive.It’s a highly imperfect bill with plenty of potential for abuse by special interests. But it’s infinitely better than the ideas Trump and other Republicans were floating just a few days ago mainly because Democrats insisted that the legislation actually help people in need.What the bill won’t do however is prevent a huge death toll if as seems all too likely the rapid spread of the coronavirus overwhelms hospitals that still aren’t getting the equipment they need. And the tragedy is that many of those deaths will be the direct result of bad leadership — Trump’s disdain for expertise and refusal to take the threat seriously a refusal that continues to cripple our response even now.
328,Will the Supreme Court Protect ‘Ministers’ From Their Church?,Linda Greenhouse,The New York Times Opinion,-2,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/opinion/supreme-court-religion-discrimination.html,The Supreme Court now even more invisible than usual may seem beside the point these days although we saw from the batch of opinions handed down on Monday that the justices are still at work. The 11 cases that were fully briefed and ready for argument this week and next will be heard eventually. I want to focus on one of those cases a largely overlooked religion case that will have a great deal to tell us about the court’s receptivity to the increasingly audacious claims of religious supremacy now hurtling its way.Ordinarily at this point in a column about a Supreme Court case I would write: “The question in the case is … ” But in fact the two sides view this case as presenting fundamentally different questions. I can’t recall such a crucial divergence between the way petitioners and respondents — the terms the Supreme Court uses for the opposing parties — frame the issue to be decided. The justices’ choice of which question to address will very likely determine the answer they give.The petitioners in Our Lady of Guadalupe School v. Morrissey-Berru are two Catholic schools in Los Angeles County each of which dismissed a lay fifth-grade teacher giving reasons that may or may not have been the real reasons. Each of the teachers — the respondents — brought suit under federal law for employment discrimination one for disability discrimination (St. James School refused to renew Kristen Biel’s contract after she told them she had breast cancer and needed time for treatment and recovery) and one for age discrimination.Here is the question the schools present to the court:“Whether the Religion Clauses prevent civil courts from adjudicating employment discrimination claims brought by an employee against her religious employer where the employee carried out important religious functions.”And here is the question the teachers are asking the court to decide:“Whether the First Amendment’s Religion Clauses prohibit lay teachers at religious elementary schools from bringing employment discrimination claims.”Note that the first question incorporates the assumption that the teachers Agnes Morrissey-Berru and Ms. Biel each of whom taught an ordinary fifth-grade curriculum along with a religion module they taught by following a workbook were performing “important religious functions.” The second question refers only to “lay teachers.” It contains no suggestion that either teacher was serving in a religious capacity; in fact neither school required members of its faculty to be practicing Catholics and Ms. Morrissey-Berru was not. She had taught full time at Our Lady of Guadalupe School for 16 years and was in her 60s when the school’s principal asked her if she wanted to retire. When she said no she was demoted to a part-time position and her contract was not renewed for the following year.These facts along with the difference between the two questions are important because this dispute is playing out against the background of a 2012 decision in which the Supreme Court first recognized a “ministerial exception” that shields religious employers from discrimination claims by their employees. The unanimous opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts in that case Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission relied on an amalgam of the First Amendment’s two Religious Clauses: the Establishment Clause which the Supreme Court has long interpreted as barring government “entanglement” with the affairs of churches and the Free Exercise Clause which prohibits government obstruction of religious practice.Editors’ PicksThe Toilet Paper Had Armed Guards and Other Coronavirus Stories4 Bright Spots Amid the Gloom of CoronavirusWoody Allen’s New Memoir Is Sometimes Funny — and Tone Deaf and BanalImageTwo church schools are arguing that lay teachers they dismissed can’t sue over discrimination because they carried out an “important religious function.” Two church schools are arguing that lay teachers they dismissed can’t sue over discrimination because they carried out an “important religious function.” Credit...Gerald Herbert/Associated PressWhile unanimity in religion cases is rare at the Supreme Court these days it was understandable in the Hosanna-Tabor case at least at first glance. After all no court would entertain a sex-discrimination suit against the Catholic Church from women who wanted to be priests. And a synagogue looking for a new rabbi would hardly be expected to open the job search to non-Jews despite the prohibition against religious discrimination in employment in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.These are the easy cases. What about the harder ones? Chief Justice Roberts achieved unanimity in Hosanna-Tabor by treating the facts of that case in a way that put it in the easy category while pushing the hard questions down the road. The plaintiff Cheryl Perich taught kindergarten but she was more than simply a lay teacher. She had been designated a “called teacher” following completion of an intensive course of theological study and a vote of the congregation. She led students in prayer and sometimes led chapel services. Her church referred to her as a “commissioned minister” and she held herself out as a minister even receiving the federal income tax break available to clergy members.Ms. Perich went on disability leave following a diagnosis of narcolepsy. When she tried to return after several months she was told that her position had been filled and that she should seek a “peaceful release” from her call. After she refused and indicated that she would invoke the Americans With Disabilities Act the school fired her for “insubordination and disruptive behavior.” When the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission brought suit on her behalf the school argued that it had dismissed her for religious reasons namely that her threat to go to court violated the Lutheran belief that Christians should resolve their disputes internally. (The E.E.O.C. has switched sides and supports the schools against the teachers in the case now before court.)In his opinion Chief Justice Roberts said the court should be reluctant “to adopt a rigid formula for deciding when an employee qualifies as a minister.” He continued: “It is enough for us to conclude in this our first case involving the ministerial exception that the exception covers Perich given all the circumstances of her employment.” The circumstances the chief justice cited were “the formal title given Perich by the church the substance reflected in that title her own use of that title and the important religious functions she performed for the church.”Now eight years after the court first announced the ministerial exception the justices are faced with deciding whether the two teachers in the new case are so like Ms. Perich as to shield their employers from the consequences of treatment that could ordinarily be unlawful or whether they are sufficiently different as to have the right to go court like any other plaintiff claiming discrimination. (Ms. Biel died of breast cancer last year and her case is being carried on by her husband Darryl.)Two separate three-judge panels ruled in favor of the teachers. Each applied the holistic approach of the chief justice’s opinion in Hosanna-Tabor and concluded that while the teachers performed some religious functions they lacked not only the title but the training Ms. Perich had received and the status she enjoyed. “No federal court of appeals has applied the ministerial exception in a case that bears so little resemblance to Hosanna-Tabor” the panel majority said in Ms. Biel’s case adding “A contrary rule under which any school employee who teaches religion would fall within the ministerial exception would not be faithful to Hosanna-Tabor or its underlying constitutional and policy considerations.”The schools represented by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty offer a very different interpretation of Hosanna-Tabor. What really mattered in that case their brief argues was not title or training but whether the employee performed an “important religious function.” Both teachers “carried out the important religious function of teaching the Catholic faith to the next generation” each serving as “a messenger or teacher of the faith” their brief asserts. Far from being faithful to Hosanna-Tabor they argue the Ninth Circuit imposed the kind of rigid formula that Chief Justice Roberts had dismissed as inappropriate.It’s important to look behind the curtain here. What is an “important religious function” and who’s to say? Solicitor General Noel Francisco’s brief is explicit in calling for complete deference to the religious employer: “Facts that demonstrate a religious organization sincerely regards its employee as performing such important religious functions should be dispositive.” And who judges sincerity? Recent Supreme Court precedents make clear that judges are not to question the sincerity of a religious claim.These questions are significant given evidence that some religious-right organizations are trying to game the system advising that even telephone receptionists be given some religious duties so as to insulate the employer from a lawsuit. Alliance Defending Freedom an organization that has gained prominence by finding plaintiffs to challenge laws that bar discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation offers the following advice in a publication titled “Protecting Your Ministry”:When feasible a religious organization should assign its employees duties that involve ministerial teaching or other spiritual qualifications — duties that directly further the religious mission. For example if a church receptionist answers the phone the job description might detail how the receptionist is required to answer basic questions about the church’s faith provide religious resources or pray with callers. Consider requiring all employees to participate in devotional or prayer time or to even lead these on occasion.Employees with some duties usually performed by (or associated with) clergy are more likely to be viewed as “minister-like” by the courts. Consequently courts are more likely to apply the ministerial exception to employment law claims based on alleged discrimination.Clearly “important religious function” as the sole test for eligibility for the ministerial exception — without any suggestion of the role the religious function plays in the employee’s overall work day — threatens to wall off many thousands of American workers from the protections against employment discrimination that federal and state laws provide.A brief filed by 70 civil rights organizations supports the Hosanna-Tabor approach but warns that without the limiting principles of the chief justice’s opinion even “a line thrown into a job description” would suffice to “insulate the employer from civil rights claims.” The brief notes that “women overwhelmingly pay the price of the ministerial exception” given that teachers in religious schools are overwhelmingly female. If covered by the ministerial exception they would be barred from bringing suits for sexual harassment.Because the ministerial exception is so new its contours are only now taking shape. The U.S. Department of Labor recently issued an opinion letter asserting that employees covered by the exception could not sue for violations of the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. Minimum wage provisions of that statute as well as the Equal Pay Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act have also been put in play in cases in the lower courts.What exactly did the justices who were on the court in 2012 think they were doing when they took that first step down the road toward giving religious organizations a carve-out from the laws that apply to the rest of us? Were they resolving a dispute on its particular facts? Or were they launching a long-range project destination unknown? If it’s the latter unanimity will be short-lived but the impact will be with us for a long time.I end this column with a brief reflection. The necessity of closing the Supreme Court and postponing arguments was obvious. It was also deeply unsettling to anyone whose professional life is entwined with the life of the Supreme Court. For us the Supreme Court’s calendar is always running somewhere in the back of our minds in sync with more commonly observed calendars and even with the highlights of family life (my daughter was born on the first Monday of October a source of merriment to the justices most of whom signed a greeting welcoming her to the world). We knew or thought we knew that as sure as the cherry trees would bloom in the last two weeks of March the justices would be on the bench.The first national catastrophe of which I have a vivid memory was John F. Kennedy’s assassination. A conversation from that time reported shortly afterward has stuck with me all these years. The night after the assassination the murdered president’s friends gathered in the Washington apartment of the political columnist Mary McGrory. “We’ll never laugh again” McGrory said to which the future senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan replied: “Heavens Mary we’ll laugh again. It’s just that we’ll never be young again.”We will travel again those of us who make it to the other side of this crisis. We will go to the movies again. We will meet a friend for a drink after work again. But we’ll never again be able to take any of it for granted.
329,The Coronavirus Becomes an Excuse to Restrict Abortions,Emily Bazelon,The New York Times Opinion,-2,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/opinion/covid-abortion-ohio-texas.html,Last week Ohio’s attorney general ordered abortion clinics in the state to stop performing most surgical abortions. On Monday the attorney general of Texas issued a stricter directive applying to “any type of abortion that is not medically necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother” and threatening jail for providers.And other states may soon join them.Ohio and Texas have moved to make abortion inaccessible under the cover of broad directives seeking to free up hospital beds and preserve the supply of personal protective equipment for medical workers with the postponement of “elective” and “nonessential” procedures.It’s obviously a good idea for states to make medical equipment and beds available as they brace for rising numbers of Covid-19 patients.But abortion uses relatively few medical resources and is time-sensitive by definition. Delaying it increases the risk to the person who is seeking it. That’s why the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology recently issued a statement saying that abortion should not fall into the category of procedures that can be delayed during the coronavirus outbreak calling it “an essential component of comprehensive health care.”To put public health first state officials should listen and heed the experts. Instead officials in Ohio and Texas are using the coronavirus crisis to achieve the longstanding political goal of reducing or ending abortion even if it means putting patients at risk.Both states have long histories of trying to restrict abortion. An Ohio ban on the procedure after six weeks of pregnancy was quickly struck down last summer by a federal judge for being “unconstitutional on its face.” And in 2016 the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a Texas law  that the court found would have forced half of the state’s abortion clinics to close.In these pandemic-timed moves against abortion providers the pretext is clear from the scope and application of the Ohio and Texas orders.The Texas order barring “any type” of abortion could apply to medication abortions. And in Ohio said David Pepper the chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party health institutions were told “you should only do essential procedures and then were allowed to decide what that meant themselves” — with the exception of abortion clinics. “That differential treatment said everything” Mr. Pepper said.The impact of the Ohio order is unclear. Planned Parenthood and other groups argued that because abortion is an essential form of health care clinics were operating as they should. Democratic lawmakers helped work out an agreement that has allowed the clinics to stay open.Editors’ PicksThe Toilet Paper Had Armed Guards and Other Coronavirus Stories4 Bright Spots Amid the Gloom of CoronavirusWoody Allen’s New Memoir Is Sometimes Funny — and Tone Deaf and BanalBut in Texas at least one abortion provider Whole Woman’s Health has had to interrupt care canceling appointments for more than 150 patients at three locations on Monday alone. On Wednesday Whole Women’s Health sued the state in federal court over the restrictions.“Patients were crying and begging us to still let them come in” said Amy Hagstrom Miller president of Whole Woman’s Health the clinic that brought the Supreme Court suit over the Texas restrictions. “We have one woman who drove 250 miles to one of our clinics who is sort of camping out not leaving waiting for us to figure out a way for her to be seen.”A doctor who provides abortions elsewhere in the state told me that her patients pleaded with her to do the procedure when they came in for ultrasounds before the order went into effect but she couldn’t because Texas requires a 24-hour waiting period.Abortion providers point out that they could use less scarce medical gear and reduce the risk of spreading the virus in waiting rooms if they could expand access to medication abortions via online consultation with a doctor. This kind of abortion involves dispensing pills; studies have shown it is safe and effective.“During the pandemic it would be possible to provide medication abortion through 11 weeks of pregnancy without an in-person visit and by mailing pills to a patient” tweeted Dr. Daniel Grossman a gynecology professor at the University of California San Francisco. “This would reduce the patient and clinician’s risk of acquiring the virus” and without the need for personal protective equipment.The problem is that at least 18 states including Texas require the doctor who prescribes the abortion pills to be present when the medication is taken which means patients have to go to a clinic two or three times (to date the pregnancy with an ultrasound to take the pills and sometimes for a follow-up visit). The Ohio Senate passed a tele-medicine abortion ban on March 4; the bill now awaits action in the House.Despite the downsides the push to use the coronavirus crisis to block access to abortion may just be getting started. This week Mississippi’s governor threatened “action” against the state’s only clinic if it continued to perform abortions without specifying what he meant. And dozens of anti-abortion groups sent a letter to Alex Azar the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services demanding the use of the government’s “broad emergency authority” to urge abortion clinics to stop operating and prevent the expansion of abortion by telemedicine.When abortions become harder to get low-income women pay the heaviest price because they have less means to travel long distances to remaining providers. And during the pandemic it’s risky for anyone to travel.As anxiety runs high and the virus imposes steep costs the government should seek to ease people’s burdens — not single out women for punishment for seeking abortions. It's their constitutional right.
330,Trump Says Cuomo’s Projections for New York Outbreak Are High,Justin Sink,Bloomberg,0,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/trump-says-cuomo-s-projections-for-new-york-outbreak-are-high?srnd=politics-vp,President Donald Trump questioned whether New York will need as many ventilators as its governor Andrew Cuomo is seeking to treat coronavirus patients saying Cuomo’s projections could be “extremely high.”Cuomo has said New York may need as many as 30000 to 40000 of the medical devices to treat coronavirus patients in critical condition. The state is the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak the largest of any country in the world according to public reporting.“I think their estimates are high” Trump said of Cuomo’s projections at a White House news conference on Friday. “I hope they’re high they could be extremely high.”Trump said “I think there’s a very good chance” the U.S. won’t need as many ventilators as Cuomo and other governors have requested.
331,Trump Set Easter Target After Kushner Meeting Seeing Empty Pews,Justin Sink Saleha Mohsin and Mario Parker,Bloomberg,0,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/how-trump-picked-easter-as-back-to-normal-date-despite-outbreak?srnd=politics-vp,President Donald Trump is determined to ease coronavirus restrictions on most Americans by the Easter holiday -- auspicious timing for his evangelical base and business allies but a worrisome deadline for public-health experts shaping the U.S. response to a still mushrooming outbreak.Trump’s impatience to get everyone back to work set in almost immediately after he urged everyone to stay home -- touched off as he watched a sermon delivered by a prominent evangelical preacher to an empty megachurch. It gained momentum as Trump listened to advice from conservative economists who warned of near-apocalyptic financial damage a view reinforced by a free-fall in markets.[See also: What Would It Take to Lift Coronavirus Restrictions? Experts Weigh In]President Trump Meets Colombian President Ivan Duque At The White HouseJared KushnerPhotographer: Kevin Dietsch/UPI/BloombergAnd it coalesced around a single day among the most sacred in the Christian calendar -- Easter Sunday April 12 -- for reasons more symbolic than scientific after a key meeting headed by Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner just four days after the stay-at-home advice.Trump’s public-health advisers appear to have made some headway in softening his insistence on that single day -- “a beautiful time a beautiful timeline” as the president has called it -- but he largely remains undeterred.Now even with the total number of American cases surpassing the tally reported by China members of the White House’s coronavirus task force are hastily preparing a menu of options for Trump to consider this weekend ahead of a planned announcement early next week when the president’s 15-day social distancing guidelines will elapse.Plan for CountiesFederal officials are considering a plan to rank U.S. counties as low medium or high risk with the hope of providing state and local officials corresponding guidance for what distancing measures they should implement -- and which can be lifted and where.“We’re going to listen to the very best health experts in the world we’re going to examine that data very carefully and we’ll be presenting this weekend the president a range of recommendations and additional guidance for going forward” Vice President Mike Pence said Thursday. “The president has made it clear that in his words he wants to open the country up.”The effort comes even as health officials warn the president’s timeline could be too ambitious risking a spike in cases that would overwhelm hospital systems just barely handling their current case load. And Deborah Birx the immunologist selected by Pence to lead the task force’s health analysis said Thursday that the administration still needed to “get all of our data together” before granular recommendations could be made.Trump gained new evidence in his push for an Easter revival after news Thursday that a record 3.3 million Americans had filed for unemployment.“This is a country that was built on getting it done and our people want to go back to work” Trump said. “I’m hearing it loud and clear from everybody.”It’s been less than two weeks since Trump backed away from his early reticence and acknowledged that coronavirus was a serious threat that required an unprecedented federal response. On March 16 he issued guidance asking Americans to spend 15 days avoiding public life -- and almost immediately the concerns of those eager to reopen American business flooded in according to people who requested anonymity to discuss internal White House deliberations.Church ImpactThe president -- who has heavily courted evangelicals while in office -- was already aware of the impact the restrictions were having on religious life. On March 15 he watched a livestream of a church service by evangelical pastor Jentezen Franklin who was broadcasting a special sermon from his empty Georgia megachurch to mark Trump’s call for a national day of prayer because of the crisis.“They’re going to show you that’s it’s just a bunch of empty seats” Franklin said as he opened his sermon. “And like thousands and thousands of places of worship -- synagogues and churches and all kinds of places where people are worshiping -- they’re not there. The people are not there.”A day later the ramifications hit home. That Monday first lady Melania Trump canceled the White House Easter egg roll for the first time in over a century -- a decision she called “difficult” and said she deeply regretted.Meanwhile White House officials grew increasingly nervous about the economic toll of the shutdown as markets saw the worst rout in decades. By mid-week the president was querying advisers about the feasibility of opening things back up.Read more: The Costs Benefits of Movement Limits in Virus Fight: QuickTakeAides within the West Wing circulated an article by Stanford Professor John Ioannidis arguing policymakers lacked sufficient data on coronavirus mortality rates and warning that “locking down the world with potentially tremendous social and financial consequences may be totally irrational.”“We don’t know how long social distancing measures and lockdowns can be maintained without major consequences to the economy society and mental health” Ioannidis wrote. “Unpredictable evolutions may ensue including financial crisis unrest civil strife war and a meltdown of the social fabric.”Similar ConcernsTrump has largely echoed these concerns as he’s signaled his desire to reopen the country saying that financial hardship could lead to depression and suicide among Americans exceeding even the numbers killed by coronavirus.That instinct was only reinforced as the president -- who even on normal days watches a lot of cable news -- flipped around the dial as panels of commentators fretted about the economic impact of the coronavirus restrictions.On the afternoon of March 20 Anthony Fauci -- the widely respected head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases -- appeared on just such a Fox News show.Members Of The Coronavirus Task Force Hold Press Briefing Anthony FauciPhotographer: Yuri Gripas/Abaca Press/BloombergThe interview was a mop-up effort for the doctor after a White House press conference earlier in the day. Fauci drew widespread attention after he appeared to hide his face when Trump mocked the State Department as the “Deep State Department” and subsequently seemed to contradict the president’s optimism over experimental treatments for coronavirus.Fauci downplayed the apparent split and anchor Bill Hemmer then pivoted asking Fauci -- who attended Jesuit high school and college -- what he thought about the idea of an Easter reopening.“Can you say whether or not we’ll have a great Easter Sunday -- an American resurrection -- on that date?” Hemmer asked.Fauci demurred saying the country needed to be “prepared to modify behavior even when it involves things that are very close to our heart.”Small Business CallBut shortly after the interview aired Trump joined a conference call also on March 20 with thousands of small business owners who raised concern about how they had limited capacity to ride out the closures forced by the response to the coronavirus.That same day White House advisers Kushner economist Kevin Hassett and some of the public health officials gathered to begin discussing how to reopen the economy.As the group discussed how to reopen the economy the idea was floated to pick a day and work backward. It was then that Easter was first brought up as a possible target date though officials also discussed the possibility of only lifting restrictions on certain geographic areas or demographic groups.Hassett who had departed the White House but was brought back to help advise on the coronavirus recovery effort warned that Easter could be too late in terms of damage to the economy.Momentum for announcing an Easter return date only built over the weekend.Stephen Moore a conservative economist and an ally of Trump said he was on a conference call Sunday afternoon with the White House and about a dozen business leaders many of whom are retired. On that call they urged Trump to set and communicate a date to Americans to reopen the country. Moore said the Easter date was tossed out.‘Economic Resurrection Day’“All but maybe one or two of the 12 or so people on the call were saying we’ve got to urge the president to go to the country to have some kind of date certain to have the economy up and running again because the devastation is too severe” Moore said in an interview.Moore added that he suggested the “terminology” of declaring Easter an “economic resurrection day” during the call.“I think there is a kind of important symbolic importance of that date” he said. “It’s a date everyone knows everyone has their eye on Easter. It’s an appropriate time. We’d have had our economy shut down for a month that’s a long time.”By Sunday evening Trump appeared resolved on announcing some end date for the virus restrictions posting an all-caps tweet that echoed commentary by Fox News host Steve Hilton.“You know that famous phrase the cure is worse than the disease?” Hilton said. “That is exactly the territory we are hurtling towards. You think it’s just the coronavirus that kills people? This total economic shutdown will kill people.”President Trump Participates In Fox News Town Hall At The White HouseDonald Trump speaks during a virtual town hall on March 24.Photographer: Doug Mills/The New York Times/BloombergTrump disclosed the Easter plans on Tuesday during a “virtual town hall” hosted by Hemmer in the White House Rose Garden.“I would love to have that -- it’s such an important day for other reasons but I’ll make it an important day for this too” Trump said. “I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter.”Hemmer responded with surprise but then echoed his remarks from the week prior saying it would be “a great American resurrection.”“That’s very good” Trump replied.Holding to TimelineSome members of the president’s team cautioned he should not be held to the deadline with senior adviser Kellyanne Conway on Thursday calling the target merely “an example” of when things could open back up by.“The president has set April 12 as an aspirational goal” Fauci said Thursday in an interview with National Public Radio. “He knows and we discussed this with him -- that you have to be very flexible in that. And he will be flexible. He put that out because he wanted to give some hope to people. But he is not absolutely wedded to that.”The president’s task force has raced to give him an announcement he can make within his timeline. The contours of the White House’s plan to reopen took shape in a Thursday teleconference between the president and state governors hosted from the Situation Room at the White House.The idea according to administration officials was to rank counties according to their coronavirus risk determined by a nationwide surveillance testing system. The idea would be that areas where the virus appeared widespread -- such as New York City -- would continue aggressive mitigation efforts.But other areas like Midwestern towns where few cases had been observed might be able to return to normal operations because public health officials could isolate and trace individuals with the virus. The system is based in part on the one used in sub-Saharan Africa to track and contain HIV.The president said he made the Easter decision because it “would be a beautiful time” that “happened to arrive” within the timeline he had already been discussing. Trump said his team had been considering an earlier date but he liked the Easter symbolism.“That’s a very special day” Trump said. “And what a great timeline this would be.”— With assistance by Jordan Fabian and Josh Wingrove
332,Fifth U.S. Lawmaker Tests Positive for Virus: Congress Update,Erik Wasson and Billy House,Bloomberg,0,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/house-is-ready-to-send-virus-measure-to-trump-congress-update?srnd=politics-vp,Speaker Nancy Pelosi called House members to Washington to pass the $2 trillion coronavirus rescue plan Friday and send it to President Donald Trump for his signature.Here are the latest developments:Fifth U.S. Lawmaker Tests Positive for Virus (4:33 p.m.)Republican Representative Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania said in a statement that he learned Friday he’s tested positive for the coronavirus.Kelly said he was tested after experiencing flu-like symptoms earlier this week.“My symptoms remain mild” Kelly said adding that he’ll work from home until he fully recovers.Three other House members -- Joe Cunningham of South Carolina and Ben McAdams of Utah both Democrats plus the GOP’s Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida -- have also tested positive along with Senator Rand Paul Republican of Kentucky.Fourth U.S. Lawmaker Tests Positive for COVID (2:16 p.m.)Representative Joe Cunningham a Democrat from South Carolina said Friday he tested positive for COVID-19 after entering self-quarantine on March 19.“While my symptoms have begun to improve I will remain at home until I know it is safe to leave self-quarantine” Cunningham said in a statement. “I am grateful that my family remains in good health and urge South Carolinians to follow the guidance and recommendations from the CDC and other health experts so that we can recover from this public health threat.”Two other House members and one senator have also tested positive.House Clears $2 Trillion Coronavirus Package (1:27 p.m.)The House passed the massive spending plan on a voice vote. The economic aid measure is to be sent quickly to Trump for his signature later in the day.House leaders thwarted Republican Thomas Massie of Kentucky’s effort to force a roll call. Leaders ensured that a quorum of more than half of the House’s members were present and refused to support Massie’s request for a recorded vote. A roll call would have taken much longer than usual because members would have entered the chamber only 30 at a time to maintain social distancing.The bill was passed after more than three hours of House debate.House Leaders Have Plan to Avoid Roll-Call Vote (12:34 p.m.)House leaders have a plan to thwart Republican Thomas Massie’s effort to force a roll-call vote on the coronavirus package two Democratic aides and one Republican aide said. That would allow the House to pass the measure on a voice vote.When Massie requests the recorded vote the chair will rule that a sufficient number of members has not stood up to support the request the aides said.House members plan to be on the chamber’s floor and upstairs in the gallery to establish a quorum of at least 216 while also maintaining social distancing the aides said.Massie to Seek Roll-Call Vote on Virus Measure (11:53 a.m.)House Republican Thomas Massie said he will insist on a roll-call vote Friday on the coronavirus response package.“I swore an oath to uphold the constitution and I take that oath seriously” Massie of Kentucky wrote on Twitter. “In a few moments I will request a vote on the CARES Act which means members of Congress will vote on it by pushing ‘yes’ or ‘no’ or ‘present.’”In a string of tweets Massie included a reference to a constitutional requirement that a quorum of the 435 House members at least 218 be on hand to conduct business.House Plans to Send Virus Bill to Trump Today (10:35 a.m.)The House plans to quickly send the $2 trillion stimulus bill to President Donald Trump for his signature after it passes the House Friday according to a senior House Democratic aide.Unlike in past cases there won’t be a time lag to enroll the 880-page bill on parchment before getting it to the president’s desk. Lawmakers and the administration are eager to get the bill enacted and begin delivering relief checks to individuals and loans to businesses a process that is expected to take weeks.House Convenes to Vote on $2 Trillion Stimulus (9 a.m.)The House convened on Friday to vote on the coronavirus measure with a number of them traveling to Washington in case they’re needed for a recorded vote.House is Ready to Send Virus Measure to Trump (6 a.m.)If no members object the House can pass the massive bill by a simple voice vote -- but leaders are making sure enough members will be on hand for a roll-call vote if necessary.

333,Trump Signs $2 Trillion Virus Bill Largest Ever U.S. Stimulus,Jordan Fabian and Justin Sink,Bloomberg,0,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/trump-signs-2-trillion-virus-bill-largest-ever-u-s-stimulus?srnd=politics-vp,President Donald Trump signed the largest stimulus package in U.S. history on Friday a $2 trillion bill intended to rescue the coronavirus-battered economy.“This will deliver urgently needed relief” Trump told reporters at the White House as he was joined by GOP leaders but no Democrats. “We’re going to keep our small businesses strong and our big businesses strong.”The hard-won plan willprovide a massive injection of loans tax breaks and direct payments to large corporations small businesses and individuals whose revenue and income have plummeted under “social distancing” restrictions meant to slow the virus’ spread.The U.S. has become the worldwide epicenter of the epidemic with more than 97000 people infected surpassing China.Stocks finished Friday in the red following a three-day rally. Traders cut positions ahead of the weekend despite passage of the stimulus bill. The S&P 500 fell 3.4% while the Dow dropped 4.1%.Read More: When and How Will I Get That $1200 Stimulus Payment?Trump urged Congress to quickly finalize the package saying earlier that it would “deliver much-needed financial assistance to hardworking families and small businesses.”The prospect of a long-term blow to the economy has prompted Trump to consider easing federal guidelines despite warnings from governors public health experts and some members of his own administration they should stay in place for longer.Trump has repeatedly spoken of “re-opening” the country by Easter and on Thursday he told governors he would rank different areas of the country based on risk level in order to allow states to eventually relax quarantine and social distancing measures.The package provides roughly $500 billion in loans and other assistance for major companies including $62 billion for the airline sector as well as cities and states struggling with virus-related financial burdens.It includes $350 billion in aid for small businesses and offers $1200 direct payments to middle- and low-income American adults plus $500 for each child. Hospitals would receive $117 billion in assistance as many become overwhelmed with virus patients. Unemployment insurance would also grow to $600 per week on top of existing state benefits.The size of the package far surpasses the $800 billion measure signed by former President Barack Obama following the 2008 financial crisis. Combined with Federal Reserve measures it would provide around $6 trillion in stimulus to the economy according to chief White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow.But the plan might not be enough to stave off an economic recession or another spike in unemployment. Even before it passed leaders in Congress said another round of stimulus would almost surely be needed.“This is not going to be the last bill” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday on PBS.The package came together over several days of marathon talks between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer. The Senate passed the bill on Wednesday with an overwhelming 96-0 vote.The House passed it by voice vote on Friday.“This is a proud moment for our country” McConnell said at the White House where he joined Trump.Democrats had demanded transparency measures on the $500 billion corporate assistance fund and they ultimately won language requiring the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve to publish who receives loans every seven days.The bill was held up for days until the language was added sparking a round of partisan squabbling in Washington. Leaders also included conditions to the aid including the ability of the Treasury Department to take equity stakes in companies that require cash assistance.The House planned to swiftly pass the stimulus package on Friday but the plan hit a speed bump when Representative Thomas Massie a libertarian Republican from Kentucky suggested he would delay a vote until lawmakers returned to Washington to cast their votes in person.Trump and lawmakers in both parties chided Massie for forcing hundreds of members to leave their home states for a maneuver that would ultimately fail to stop passage of the bill.“Heading to Washington to vote on pandemic legislation” New York Republican Peter King wrote on Twitter. “Because of one member of Congress refusing to allow emergency action entire Congress must be called back to vote in House. Risk of infection and risk of legislation being delayed. Disgraceful. Irresponsible.”Trump blasted also Massie using Twitter to call him a “third rate Grandstander” and saying he should be thrown out of the Republican Party.
334,Johnson Accused of Prioritizing Brexit Over Saving Lives With Ventilator Plan,Joe Mayes and Alex Morales,Bloomberg,0,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/johnson-s-ventilator-push-hobbled-by-mishaps-and-confusion?srnd=politics-vp,Britain’s attempt to plug a shortage of life-saving ventilators needed to treat the most seriously ill coronavirus patients is being hobbled by mishaps and confusion.Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s failure to sign up to a European Union-wide effort to buy ventilators has left the government open to accusations of putting Brexit over people’s lives -- while U.K. manufacturers have warned they might need months to respond to the government’s call to ramp up production.At stake is Britain’s ability to respond to a nationwide outbreak that has already claimed 759 lives. The National Health Service has less than a third of the devices it needs and Johnson’s call to get 30000 in service within weeks is not just a test of his leadership but also his reluctance to engage with the EU.“The hard reality is there’s an awfully big hill to climb” said James Greenham managing director of medical device manufacturer EMS Physio. “When you hear ministers say we’re going to have thousands of these in a few weeks you simply cannot believe them.”Johnson’s spokesman initially said the government didn’t take part in the Europe-wide procurement program because the U.K. isn’t a member of the EU. After the bloc pointed out Britain was still welcome to join the prime minister’s office said it didn’t receive the invitation due to a “communication problem.”Four RoundsThe bloc insisted British representatives were in meetings about sourcing ventilators and it was clear the U.K. which left the bloc in January was eligible to join the EU initiative. London’s decision not to take part means it has already missed out on four procurement rounds.“The possibility of launching a procurement procedure has been discussed several times in meetings of the health security committee in which the U.K. participated” Commission spokesman Stefan De Keersmaecker told reporters. “At these meetings the commission stressed its readiness to further support countries with the procurement of medical counter-measures if needed. So member states and the U.K. had the opportunity to signal they wanted to participate.”On the domestic front companies such as Airbus SE Dyson Ltd. and Formula 1 teams have all offered to produce ventilators. But industry executives were skeptical about how quickly the devices will be available.Even using an existing ventilator design it could take three months to source the materials needed and train manufacturing staff to oversee the process Greenham said.Dyson announced this week it had developed a new ventilator and received an order from Britain for 10000 units -- but the government later said its purchase would depend on regulators approving the device.“So Much Ambiguity”A separate group including Airbus McLaren Automotive Ltd Siemens AG and Meggitt Plc is trying to ramp up production of existing ventilator designs made by Smiths Group Plc and Penlon Ltd -- but it is also waiting for the green light from government.“Things are happening but there’s so much ambiguity and vagueness at the moment” said Tony Hague chief executive officer of Midlands-based manufacturer PP Control & Automation which has offered to help the ventilator-building effort. “There are a lot of people not very clear about a lot of things.”Any new ventilator design would have to jump through lengthy -- and necessary -- regulatory hoops in order to be approved for use in intensive care wards according to Greenham. That process which includes developing a prototype testing it “to destruction” and ensuring traceability of all components typically takes two to three years he said.Johnson held talks with some of the manufacturers late on Thursday according to his office and assured them the government would move as quickly as possible to approve new designs as long as they meet the requirements.Test First“I’m sure Dyson and Airbus have got thousands of engineers who can help but you’ve still got to test it and verify it before you go into production” he said.Greenham’s verdict chimes with what Penlon Ltd. said soon after Johnson issued his call to manufacturers. The company makes anesthesia machines that perform some of the functions of intensive care ventilators and is now involved in one of the groups working to scale up production. To develop a new product from scratch and secure regulatory approval would take three years it said.For all the criticism some progress is being made with the government acquiring 50 ventilators from overseas in the past week according to one official familiar with the matter.“The government is pulling out every stop to explore every avenue to get more ventilators” said Stephen Phipson chief executive of the MakeUK manufacturing lobby group. “No stone is unturned on this one. Whether it results in ventilators being produced quickly enough is another matter -- but they are trying everything.”— With assistance by Ian Wishart
335,Trump’s Sprint to Relax Regulations Must Clear Virus Hurdles,Jennifer A Dlouhy Amena Saiyid and Susan Decker,Bloomberg,0,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/trump-s-sprint-to-relax-regulations-must-clear-virus-hurdles?srnd=politics-vp,The Trump administration is racing against the clock to lock in pieces of the president’s first-term deregulation agenda before an obscure law makes it easier for congressional foes to reverse his policies.Regulators are rushing to finish work as soon as next week on some top Trump initiatives including relaxing fuel economy standards for vehicles and eliminating the legal basis for restricting mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants. The haste is necessary to prevent the measures from being killed by Congress next year if President Donald Trump loses re-election and Democrats retake the Senate.“Time matters” said Cary Coglianese a regulatory expert at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. “Anything that delays regulatory changes from going forward in the last year of an administration does raise the risk of a reversal should control of the White House change.”The effort has been complicated by the coronavirus which has strained government resources distracted policy makers and created a public-relations risk to any measures not connected to the global pandemic.The White House Office of Management and Budget warned agency heads last week that the coronavirus is now the top priority with everything but “mission-critical” work taking a back seat. Nevertheless agency officials now are preparing to advance the final fuel economy and mercury measure as soon as next week according to two people familiar with the matter who asked for anonymity to discuss administration strategy.Agencies Still Hand-Delivering Regulatory Documents to CapitolTrump officials are well acquainted with the threat posed by the 24-year-old Congressional Review Act which gives lawmakers special power to overturn recent regulations on a simple majority vote and without being held hostage by filibusters. Republicans in Congress wielded it to kill a slew of Obama-era rules in 2017.The repeal power applies to regulations imposed by federal agencies within the past 60 legislative days -- a cutoff now expected around mid-May. But that deadline is a moving target and could shift sooner or later if the coronavirus causes changes to the congressional schedule.The Trump administration advanced some of its highest-priority regulations earlier to avoid the CRA cutoff even carving up its automobile plan so that last year it finalized the most important piece of it: a strike against California’s authority to write its own rules on tailpipe greenhouse gas emissions.Now the administration is preparing to unveil the second piece of its auto package: a rule resetting mandates on fuel economy and emissions. The Environmental Protection Agency is also moving to issue its final rule asserting mercury pollution control requirements are too costly to justify at coal-fired power plants.Still other efforts such as authorizing a sale of drilling rights in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge were within weeks of being finished before the coronavirus was deemed a pandemic.“They were really working to get everything done and then this thing escalated to the level it has and understandably put everything on hold” said Tom Pyle president of the American Energy Alliance that has championed the auto plan.While the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs is still reviewing draft rules tied to Trump’s pre-pandemic priorities those efforts are up against a deluge of coronavirus-spurred policy making.Trump agencies now are triaging to get the highest priority items finished. At the EPA for example reviews of ambient air quality standards for ozone and particulate matter are in limbo while the agency wraps up work on the auto and mercury measures.“We are moving forward on any number of regulatory issues” EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told reporters Thursday. While the new coronavirus has caused employees to work from home “all of our employees are still working.”Christopher Guith a senior vice president at the Chamber of Commerce’s Global Energy Institute said “The administration is appropriately focused on responding to the global coronavirus pandemic and stabilizing the economy.”“The response is all hands on deck and while regulatory reform continues to be a priority of the Chamber and the business community we understand that resources may have to be diverted” he said.When lawmakers are sworn in next January they will get an extra 75 legislative days to target any rules that were still within the CRA window when Congress adjourns this year.Even without the CRA threat any so-called midnight rulemaking by the Trump administration can be easily wiped away. Rules finalized within the final 30 days of an administration generally could be pulled back if the White House changes hands. And ongoing lawsuits against rules could make it easier for a successor to overturn them.Imposing controversial policies now during a global health crisis could invite blowback as nearly 75000 have tested positive in the U.S. and more than 1000 have died from it.The public might wonder “why are you even dealing with this right now when you’re supposed to deal with Covid?” said Dan Bosch director of regulatory policy at the American Action Forum. Bosch said that’s particularly true for three proposed immigration rules that would limit the ability of asylum seekers to obtain work permits and increase the fees on many forms and applications.It would be a “colossal mistake” to advance measures undermining clean air requirements for cars and power plants amid a spreading respiratory virus said James Goodwin a senior policy analyst for Center for Progressive Reform. Those regulations already were a bad idea he said and now the coronavirus makes them even worse.“Patients who live in areas with better air quality have higher survival rates” Goodwin said. “The point is to advance policies right now that improve our ability to absorb this epidemic.”— With assistance by Ryan Beene
336,A Virus to Kill Populism Or Make It Stronger,Marc Champion,Bloomberg,0,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/will-coronavirus-kill-populism-or-strengthen-leaders-like-trump?srnd=politics-vp,The last global crisis paved their way to power. The question is whether the latest one will loosen their grip on it.Fallout from the 2008 financial meltdown produced an electoral earthquake that upended postwar party politics brought a new breed of populists to government and decisively shifted the balance among global powers toward China from the U.S. Novel Coronavirus may prove just as disruptive.It’s too soon to predict which governments will suffer politically from their handling of the virus as the death toll continues to grow and a quarter of the world’s population remains in lockdown. Whether responses to Covid-19 unmask or entrench such leaders as U.S. President Donald Trump Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil or Italian opposition chief Matteo Salvini remains unclear.So too whether China will succeed or fail in transforming a disease that appears to have spread across the globe from Hubei province into a geopolitical opportunity as it airlifts medical teams and supplies of masks and other equipment to burnish its image in countries such as Iran and Italy.Chinese Medical Team Arrives In MilanMembers of a Chinese anti-epidemic medical expert team attend a press conference after landing at Milan - Malpensa airport in Ferno on March 18.Photographer: Photographer: Emanuele Cremaschi/Getty ImagesBut what’s already apparent is that for populist leaders who thrive on portraying their country as under siege the coronavirus is proving a challenge. This time the enemy is an invisible one that doesn’t easily fit into a simple anti-elite anti-migrant or anti-science narrative that has proven so politically fruitful before. Rather than fear others people fear for themselves. Not only is the coronavirus creating a Darwinist test of which systems and societies are better able to cope more citizens will put a premium on political decisions being underpinned by truth said Ahn Cheol-soo a former South Korean presidential candidate and trained physician. Ahn was speaking from self-isolation after treating the sick in the country’s outbreak epicenter of Daegu.“It will eventually help build a political landscape in which the public isn’t swayed by populism” said Ahn who has formed a political group to mount a challenge in April 15 parliamentary elections. “That will eventually make populists lose ground.”At the same time some leaders have sought to tap into wider unease about a virus that has spread across a deeply interconnected globe at the speed of modern airliners. It’s forced even governments that favor globalization to shut down travel and disrupt supply chains. The course of the virus could yet be portrayed as vindicating nationalist arguments for a less connected world.After initially dismissing the severity of the pandemic Trump has since tweeted that “THIS IS WHY WE NEED BORDERS!” He referred to the coronavirus as “Chinese” before backtracking.In Hungary Prime Minister Viktor Orban initially focused popular ire on a group of Iranian students who were quarantined and later tested positive. As the virus took hold in the wider community he then dropped the anti-immigrant theme that helped him win a third straight election in 2018.Salvini leader of the League party whose roots are in the hardest-hit north of Italy linked the spread of the disease with migrants who crossed the Mediterranean to Italy from north Africa. He didn’t provide any evidence.Italy's League Leader Matteo Salvini InterviewMatteo SalviniPhotographer: Alessia Pierdomenico/BloombergA former interior minister Salvini has also portrayed Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte as doing too little too slowly to combat coronavirus while at the same time accusing him of imposing the decisions of an elite without consulting parliament. Yet none of these arguments has gained traction to date in a country struggling to cope with what’s quickly becoming the world’s largest outbreak of the disease.Italians are instead rallying behind their institutions in the emergency. Conte’s imposition of an ever-tighter lockdown has seen his government’s popularity reach a record high backed by 71% of Italians in March according to a Demos survey. But whether that popularity will survive a postmortem of Conte’s handling of the crisis also remains to be seen.A similar dynamic seems to be at play in Germany. Chancellor Angela Merkel and her beleaguered Christian Democratic Union party were severely damaged in elections by the wave of refugees who fled to the country from the Syrian war in 2015-16.They are now seeing their popularity rise on the back of their coronavirus response. A recent poll showed support for the Christian Democrats has jumped by five percentage points. The party joined traditionally fiscally cautious peers such as U.S. Republicans and Britain’s Conservatives in abandoning  ideological commitments to cutting budget deficits. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz called for a “bazooka” to be fired into the economy.Members Of The Coronavirus Task Force Hold Press Briefing Donald Trump leaves following a Coronavirus Task Force news conference in the briefing room of the White House in Washington D.C. on March 22.Photographer: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPA via Bloomberg“The economic crisis rising immigration these are things you can easily blame on one group or the political elite” said Benjamin Moffitt a senior lecturer in politics at the Australian Catholic University in Melbourne whose latest book “Populism” was published this month. “But this is a biological crisis—to stop it you can’t just drain the swamp or block refugees from coming.”Whereas Salvini has the luxury of opposition and risks at worst being side lined the stakes are higher for Trump and Bolsonaro.The U.S. president has come under attack from state governors for not acting quickly enough to contain Covid-19 despite a $2 trillion aid package for the economy passed in the Senate. He claimed churches would be full again for Easter a little over two weeks away. On Thursday the U.S. surpassed Italy in cases with more than 80700 and is poised to overtake China.In Brazil Bolsonaro’s insistence that life and business should go on as usual despite the virus has led to protests in the major cities with people hanging out of their windows to bang pots and pans. Already under pressure before the pandemic as scandal swirled around his family and a promised economic renaissance failed to materialize Bolsonaro looks vulnerable.BRAZIL-HEALTH-VIRUS-BOLSONARO-PROTESTAn image of Bolsonaro and the phrase ‘Hysteria Damages the Economy’ is projected on the wall of a building during a protest against the president regarding his handling of the coronavirus outbreak in Sao Paulo on March 21. Photographer: Miguel Schincariol/AFP via Getty Images“This crisis has knocked the government out of his orbit” said Creomar de Souza chief executive of Dharma Political Risk and Strategy in Brazil. “The characteristics he has that were seen as positive like combativeness and obstinacy are now being seen as a liability.”Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrado a populist from the left has also downplayed the severity of the threat from the virus telling people “to keep taking the family out to eat.”Although Mexico still has relatively few recorded cases a telephone poll by the owner of newspaper Reforma found 44% of Mexicans now disapprove of his handling of the coronavirus threat to 37% in favor. On Thursday he appeared to  change his tone and called on companies to send their workers home.In the U.K. the urgency surrounding Covid-19 has even buried the debate over the terms of the country’s departure from the European Union—and with it Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s flirtation with populism.He deferred conspicuously to medical and epidemiological experts in his initial attempt at taking a measured approach to fighting the disease. During the Brexit campaign experts were deliberately derided.Yet the idea that fighting coronavirus will lead to a restoration of a pre-financial crisis faith in fact is probably wishful thinking according to Moffitt. That particularly goes for the U.S.“Expertise in terms of this idea of neutral knowledge is dead in a lot of people’s minds” he said. “You cannot spend a decade arguing that climate change is nonsense and that you don’t need vaccines and then turn around and say actually yes we need experts.”— With assistance by Kanga Kong John Follain Walter Brandimarte Zoltan Simon Misha Savic and Samy Adghirni
337,Wisconsin Governor Requests Mail-In Ballots: Campaign Update,Emma Kinery,Bloomberg,0,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/campaign-update?srnd=politics-vp,Governor Tony Evers asked lawmakers to ensure that all of Wisconsin’s 3.3 million registered voters receive absentee ballots as the state moves forward with plans to hold its April 7 primary election despite the coronavirus pandemic.Evers a Democrat said the request to the Republican-held state legislature was made to allow as many people as possible vote while many Americans are staying at home to limit the spread of the virus. Evers declared a state of emergency in Wisconsin last week but both he and Republican leaders in the legislature opposed any move to delay the vote as several states have done.“This is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue -- this is an issue of democracy” Evers said in a tweet. “I don’t care who gets the credit I just want to make sure that everyone has the chance to vote this April. We don’t have time for politics -- we have to get this done folks.”Physical polling locations would still be open though they are the responsibility of local governments.Biden Allies to Air Anti-Trump Ad in Spanish: Campaign Update (4:44 p.m.)A Democratic-allied super PAC is doubling down on an ad Donald Trump’s campaign has tried to stop television stations from airing.The super PAC Priorities USA said Friday that in addition to continuing to broadcast the original ad in several states it will begin airing a Spanish-language version in Florida. The spot titled “Exponential Threat” features Trump appearing to call the coronavirus a “hoax” and criticizes his response to the pandemic.Earlier this week the Trump campaign asked TV stations in swing states to take down the ad which the president’s allies say is misleading. The Trump campaign says the president was describing Democrats’ efforts to politicize the coronavirus not calling the virus itself a hoax.Fact-checkers at the Washington Post called a similar ad from Joe Biden’s campaign misleading noting that the full comments from Trump at a campaign rally compared “politicizing the coronavirus” to the investigation into Russian interference and his impeachment.Daniela Martins Hispanic media director of Priorities USA said the super PAC would not be deterred. “The Trump campaign is doing all they can to prevent us from hearing Trump’s own words as he downplayed and mismanaged this crisis leaving us all at risk. But Latino communities will not fall for his lies” she said in a statement. -- Max BerleyBiden Defends Governors On Virus Response (3:42 p.m.)Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden fired off one of his toughest critiques of Donald Trump to date chastising the president for attacking state and local officials “doing the work he won’t” to fight for more equipment to combat coronavirus.“Patients need ventilators. Nurses need equipment. And Donald Trump is attacking people who dare to do something about it” Biden said Friday on Twitter.Trump said Thursday on Fox News that he’s having problems with Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer a Democrat who endorsed Biden and is pushing aggressively for more federal support for her state. Trump referring to her as “the young a woman governor you know who I’m talking about from Michigan” said he doesn’t “know if she knows what’s going on” and “all she does is sit there and blame the federal government.”Biden said he thanks “God every day for people like @GovWhitmer who are doing the work he won’t.”Whitmer has frequently been mentioned as a potential running mate for Biden after he committed to picking a woman for the role. Whitmer said earlier this month that she wasn’t going to be Biden’s vice-presidential pick but wanted to help him make a good choice. “I’m going to help him vet and make sure he’s got a great running mate. It is not going to be me” she said in an interview on MSNBC. “But I’m going to have a hand in helping make sure that that he has got the rounded out ticket that can win.” -- Jennifer Epstein— With assistance by Jennifer Epstein and Max Berley
338,Trump Promises GOP Convention Will Be Held This August,John Harney and Mario Parker,Bloomberg,0,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/trump-promises-gop-convention-will-be-held-this-august?srnd=politics-vp,President Donald Trump said that the Republican National Convention would go forward as planned this August even as the coronavirus has caused the cancellation of large-scale events all across the U.S.The Democrats are scheduled to hold their convention in Milwaukee from July 13 to 16. The Republican convention is to be held from Aug. 24 to 27 and the president told Sean Hannity on Fox News Thursday night that “We’re quite a bit later than them which I think is good.”Trump said there was “no way” he would cancel the convention. “It’s going to be incredible.”He added that by the end of August “we’re going to be in a great space” though he did not specify why he thought that. He said that he might have a rally in Milwaukee. His campaign has not held any rallies because of the virus.The Democratic National Committee has been looking at contingency options for its party gathering amid a growing concern that the coronavirus crisis will not have abated by then.“As we navigate the unprecedented challenge of responding to the coronavirus we’re exploring a range of contingency options to ensure we can deliver a successful convention without unnecessary risk to public health” Katie Peters communications director for the DNC’s convention committee said in a statement earlier this week.Peters added it is a “very fluid situation” with the Democratic convention more than three months away.A convention is the only mechanism the parties have to nominate a presidential pick. If the pandemic persists they would have to change the rules in order to hold a different type of forum.CNN announced Thursday night that former Vice President Joe Biden the leading Democratic candidate will take part in a network town hall on the coronavirus on Friday night.— With assistance by Emma Kinery
339,The Coronavirus Crisis Reveals New York at Its Best and Worst,Adam Gopnik,The New Yorker,-2,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/30/the-coronavirus-crisis-reveals-new-york-at-its-best-and-worst,Plagues happen only to people. Animals can suffer from mass infections of course but they experience them as one more bad blow from an unpredictable and predatory natural environment. Only people put mental brackets around a phenomenon like the coronavirus pandemic and attempt to give it a name and some historical perspective some sense of precedence and possibility. The coronavirus indifferent to individuals has no creed or moral purpose but it becomes human when it hits us—neither microscopic nor historic just the size we are as we experience its effects. As Albert Camus wrote in “The Plague” the 1947 novel that’s becoming to this disruption what W. H. Auden’s “September 1 1939” was to the aftermath of 9/11 the microbe has no meaning; we seek to create one in the chaos it brings.The final weekend of semi-ordinary life in New York arrived on Friday the 13th. In the week that followed New York became a ghost town in a ghost nation on a ghost planet. The gravity and scale of what is happening can overwhelm the details of daily life in which human beings seek a plateau of normalcy in abnormal times just as they always have in blitzes and battles. Nobody has any confidence at all about whether we are seeing the first phases of a new normal the brief calm before a worse storm or a wise reaction that may allow not so horribly long from now for a renewal of common life. Here are some notes on things seen by one walker in the city and some voices heard among New Yorkers bearing witness on and off the streets.I t happened slowly and then suddenly. On Monday March 9th the spectre of a pandemic in New York was still off on the puzzling horizon. By Friday it was the dominant fact of life. New Yorkers began to adopt a grim new dance of “social distancing.” On a sparsely peopled 5 train heading down to Grand Central Terminal on Saturday morning passengers warily tried to achieve an even strategic spacing like chess pieces during an endgame: the rook all the way down here but threatening the king from the back row. Then when the doors opened they got off the train one by one in single hesitant file unlearning in a minute New York habits ingrained over lifetimes the elbowed rush for the door.In the relatively empty subway cars one can focus on the human details of the riders. A. J. Liebling in a piece published in these pages some sixty years ago recounted the tale of a once famous New York murder in which the headless torso of a man was found wrapped in oilcloth floating in the East River. The hero of the tale as Liebling chose to tell it was a young reporter for the great New York World who identified the body by type before anyone else did: he saw that the corpse’s fingertips were wrinkled in a way that characterized “rubbers”—masseurs—in Turkish baths. Only someone whose hands were wet that often would have those fingertips. On the subway in the street nearly everyone has rubbers’ hands now with skin shrivelled from excessive washing.At the other end of the day in Central Park late at night the only people out were the ones walking their dogs. Dogs are still allowed to have proximity if only to other dogs. They can’t be kept from it. The negotiations of proximity—the dogs demanding it the owners trying to resist it without being actively rude—are newly arrived in the city. Walking home down the almost empty avenues you could see the same silhouette repeated: dogs straining toward dogs on long-stretched leashes held by watchful owners keeping their distance a nightly choreography of animal need and human caution.At J.F.K. in Queens during that strange weekend people huddled and waited anxiously for the homecoming of family members who had been stranded abroad with the understanding that homecoming now comes at a cost: arriving passengers have been asked to self-quarantine for two weeks. J.F.K. had been spared some of the nightmarish lines and confusion seen at Dulles in Washington and O’Hare in Chicago following Donald Trump’s abrupt decision the previous Wednesday (relayed in a garbled announcement) to suspend most travel from Europe. But no one is spared the emotional ambivalence of the moment: every feeling pulled out hard like an attenuated nerve. Parents are keenly aware that in bringing their children home to what is meant to be safety they are bringing them to an increasingly unsafe place.“Barren” was the word that Lisa Cleveland who lives in New Jersey used for the normally bustling airport. She spent part of Saturday morning waiting for her teen-age children Zoë and Xander who had been staying in the Netherlands. Their father is a Dutch citizen. “I’m still trying to understand the risks but he’s been tracking this for more than two months” Cleveland said. “He’s that guy.” Getting the kids back to the U.S. before further barriers went up wasn’t easy. “Xander and Zoë—she likes the double dot over her name otherwise it becomes a Dutch word that rhymes with ‘cow’—were in Amsterdam. We struggled and struggled to find them tickets home. Someone told us that one of the airlines was going to go bankrupt.”When she saw Zoë and Xander at last Cleveland said “it was just such an enormous relief. And more emotion than you can easily imagine. This is the first day I’ve been able to smile in weeks. But now they have to do a mandatory self-quarantine for two weeks.”Zoë said “Not that I’m not glad to be home but I’ll miss school. The mood on the plane was weird—half the plane was wearing masks.” Because safety masks were sold out in Amsterdam she and her brother decided to wear masks that their parents had bought them out of an abundance of caution. They were 3M respirators the kind an industrial worker might wear in the presence of toxic aerosols. “I felt people were judging us” Zoë said. “It’s a crazy mask. No one else on the plane had on such a serious mask.”Crises take an X-ray of a city’s class structure. After 9/11 it was the Middle Eastern and South Asian taxi-drivers who suddenly became visible lining their cabs with American flags for fear of being taken for jihadis. Now particular visibility falls on bicycle deliverymen Mexicans and Indians the emissaries of Seamless who modestly shoulder the burden of feeding the middle class. On the East Side outside a Thai restaurant at 7 p.m. on Saturday a single deliveryman balanced five bags of food hanging from his handlebars. His livelihood hinges on his getting meals to people who are self-isolating a luxury he doesn’t have. Although he was grateful for the work he said he was a little frightened about his own exposure. Asked how many more sacks he ferries during his shift these days he shrugged and said at least ten times the usual load.Just as the medical system depends on the lowest paid of the health workers—the orderlies and custodians—the food system now that restaurants have been limited to takeout and delivery depends on a whole cadre of men pedalling bicycles. They are literally overburdened and that night this one got off to an unsteady start like a plane in wartime trying to take off with too large a load of refugees. He glanced up at a high-rise condominium being built on Madison Avenue and Eighty-ninth Street. Construction work continues right through the closures—no letup in the noise and activity even on the weekend. The workmen in their puffy vests and hard hats were side by side though they didn’t seem particularly worried or constrained. The exigencies of Manhattan real estate and development are evidently undeterred by the crisis.What’s strange about this energetic construction of more luxury housing is that in the existing apartment buildings nearby on the impossibly wealthy blocks of Fifth Avenue scarcely a light can be seen. Nobody’s home. Most of the truly wealthy have gone by helicopter or private jet to the Hamptons or to an island somewhere. There can be something vexing about the thought that those whose wealth relies on the intense close-ordered entanglement of the city abandon it in its hour of need or dread but they do. Still who would not decamp to a remote island if she had one? “Boccaccio-ing” someone calls this business of fleeing the city in honor of the Italian author who wrote of fleeing Florence during the Black Death and telling stories with his companions for ten days up in the hillside villas of Fiesole.In West Harlem Sam Rivera certainly can’t leave. At a residential facility run by the Fortune Society and known as the Castle his job is to oversee the rooms and the souls of about eighty-five men and women almost all released from prison not long ago some as recently as this month. They come in and out of his office all day seeking help and solace. “It’s crazy but the system is still churning” Rivera said. He is a huge man with a beaming steady smile. “They’re still discharging people from Rikers and elsewhere even as we go through all this. So we have a steady inflow of people coming home even while we’re trying to lock down the people we already have.”This is Rivera’s second plague. Incarcerated himself when H.I.V./aids hit New York’s state prisons in the nineteen-eighties he still remembers the shock of working in the isolated wards where those who fell ill with the disease were sequestered: “Everyone was so frightened that they pretty much put on a hazmat suit to go into those places. Except me.” His experience led him once he was out of prison to join the aids-care movement where he met and worked with Anthony Fauci the current director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Now that Rivera is responsible for the residents of the Castle he thinks hard about what to do. His memories of the aids epidemic are strong and they give an oddly positive cast to his take on today’s crisis.“We’ve stockpiled three weeks’ worth of food and we’re sending staff to screen visitors at Rikers” he said. (City jails have since suspended in-person visits.) “But it’s not a deadly virus for most people—it’s not as deadly as aids. I think we’ll get to the point where the next announcement will have to be What are we doing for people who have to manage the elders and those with compromised immune systems? I’m coping two ways. I’m not overthinking it. I expect to get it one day. I’ll feel sick and I’ll manage it I’ll come through it and my body will build immunities to it. And that will be a blessing.”Despite his brio in the face of the virus Rivera worries about the vulnerable residents in his charge. “We have a number of people in the Castle who are living with H.I.V. and we’re really monitoring where and how they are” he said. “The problem is that they don’t like following up. Most of them have had bad experiences with the medical system or sometimes no experience with it. But if anyone has flu-like symptoms then we are able to get a test right now at Columbia Presbyterian which is great. All we can do is watch and move forward day by day.”Panic-buying has been in evidence all over town if unevenly executed. Many chain supermarkets and food stores are stripped bare of groceries in a way that calls to mind the days just after 9/11. Back then people gathered “Armageddon baskets” filled with expensive things—steak and Perrier. Now they assemble survival kits. Toilet paper and canned beans are treasured. (There is no chance the grocers assure the city of running out of either.) Still there’s a pattern to the emptying of the supermarkets. Every potato every carrot every onion in a West Side Citarella is gone as is every package of pasta and every jar of tomatoes in an uptown Whole Foods. Yet many of the less tony supermarkets the nearby Key Foods and Gristedes have remained well stocked and serene throughout the rush.“You realize what this means?” a college student who grew up in New York said about the depredations of upscale shoppers. “It means they believe that it’s every man for himself. They don’t really believe in community or that people will or can share. Their instinct despite living in one of the more affluent spots in the world is that they’re on their own.” The plague as Camus insisted exposes existing fractures in societies in class structure and individual character; under stress we see who we really are. The secession of the very rich the isolation of the well-off the degradation of social capital by inequality: these truths become sharply self-evident now.The current crisis is in some respects the mirror image of the post-9/11 moment. That turned out to be a time of retrospective anxiety about a tragedy unforeseen. The anticipatory jitters weren’t entirely unfounded—anthrax killed a hospital worker in Manhattan—but they arose from something that had already happened and wouldn’t be repeated. By contrast the covid-19 crisis involves worries about something we’ve been warned is on the way. The social remedy is the opposite of the sort of coming together that made the days and weeks after 9/11 endurable for so many as they shared dinners and embraced friends. That basic human huddling is now forbidden with the recommendations for “distancing” bearing down ever tighter: no more than five hundred people together then two hundred and fifty then fifty then ten.At the same time the emphasis on social distancing and even isolation is part of an epidemiological study in statistical probability. If we delay the communication of the virus from patient to patient the curve of new cases may flatten so that fewer people at any time will need hospitalization reducing the stress on the system and keeping health services available for all the other countless ailments that strike a city of eight million. In a way the self-seclusions are exhibits not of personal panic but of public-minded prudence: we are trying to save the lives above all of the most vulnerable. But of course the plague-in-progress may progress despite it all.ove in the Time of Cholera” is Gabriel García Márquez’s great novel of another plague time—with cholera we’re told referring to both the name of the terrible disease and the condition of being colérico angry and impassioned. Love in the time of coronavirus was bound to happen—in crisis and despair is born desire—and it already has. Kids forced to leave college and return home to the city talked about long-sought last-minute assignations on the night before the general expulsion.Sometimes desire in anxiety can be more delicate. In Grand Central Terminal what some call “the tile telephone”—the whispering gallery in front of the Oyster Bar under the beautiful basket weave of arches—has never been so clear. The noise of the station is usually so intense that the tiled ceiling turns mute. Now for the first time in forever the abatement in the roar and press of people allows couples’ murmured endearments spoken into one corner to race up through the solid Guastavino tile and carry all the way over to the diagonally facing corner.A pair of young friends encountered there that Friday weren’t out-of-towners; this was Kyle and Leah and they’re New Yorkers through and through who decided that this was the moment finally to really see Grand Central. The appetite for the joys of structured sightseeing is indomitable. Another young woman Amaya—visiting from Durham North Carolina and crushed to find the city so inhospitable—stood in the corner smiling and singing to a friend on the other side.But it was on Saturday when the sky was blue and the temperature hovered in the fifties that the irresistible urge to find pleasure brought out flocks of young people to various outdoor spaces. “I’ve noticed that a lot of people my age are headed to Prospect Park and are taking advantage of a beautiful day a large space where they can mingle” a thirty-one-year-old woman said early on Saturday afternoon. “They sort of keep social distance but also connect.” Many photographs shared widely on social media seemed to show the millennials lounging thoughtlessly close prompting a Twitter uproar.The uproar did seem to reflect a determination on the part of young people in New York to go on living like young people in New York. “Last night I went out to a restaurant” the same woman said. “And the wait was half an hour. So we went to a different restaurant and at that one when the waitress was bringing out drinks she got confused about where to go since they had just changed their seating—I think to have more space between tables. ”Like life-hardened Sam Rivera these younger New Yorkers have touching if perhaps worrying faith in their own invulnerability. “I don’t think people in my cohort are that terrified” the woman went on. “Most people seem to believe that they will get the virus and they will survive having it. The vibe is pretty much one of acceptance even a little bit of excitement. I hate to say this but it’s become a distraction from the election. Also a lot of my friends are cooking. Like ambitious stockpot recipes—soups and stews—and a lot of baking too. Pies and cookies. I myself am currently deep-cleaning my apartment knowing that I’ll be stuck in it.” Meanwhile she said “my family is from New York and my father has been fearlessly going to the gym. I think there’s a bit of yolo fear to it—he wants to make the most of his life. But I have pleaded with him to stop.”That same Saturday Maggie McGlinchy a bartender worked all evening at Bernie’s Restaurant on the border of Greenpoint and Williamsburg. “It was full” she said on Sunday. “But it doesn’t take much to fill the restaurant. The actual volume was low and it seemed as though no one wanted to be seen to be fully enjoying themselves. I sold a lot of Martinis that night—mostly Martinis or Old-Fashioneds or Manhattans. No wine or artisanal ale. Everyone was trending the spirits.“At Bernie’s I’m on a first-name basis with possibly a third of the customers—it’s definitely a home base. In the past two nights a lot of my customers are people who wanted to come in and support us. Most of my tips were over twenty per cent. That’s the other thing about social distancing—so much of what it means to be comforted is to be . . . not distant. Stay positive I’d say—we’re feeling well right now and let’s hope it stays positive and do you want another drink?” But by Sunday night all the bars and restaurants in the city had been ordered to stop table service in the next few days an unimaginable act a week earlier as strange as if the island of Manhattan had floated out to sea.McGlinchy said that she is looking for a new job but there are no new jobs for bartenders because there are no bars.“What do I have going forward? I have a month’s rent and a warm e-mail from my former employer” she said dryly on Tuesday morning. “I’ve had some regulars send me twenty bucks over Venmo. Last tips.”The full weight of the shutdown will fall most heavily on the Maggies of the world who have little or no financial cushion. (Later Bernie’s set up a GoFundMe campaign for the staff.) Hundreds of thousands of people in the service and entertainment industries—from bartenders to the “swing” theatre actors who pride themselves on leaping into whatever role has been left open by an unwell lead—are out of work for a time that has no known limit.There are as well the small crushing disappointments that though reasonably lost in the larger life-and-death clamor are very real to the people they have happened to. The actress Ilana Levine had just opened in a new play “The Perplexed” by Richard Greenberg—a comeback of sorts for her—when all theatres concert venues and night clubs were closed. “You know I had been on Broadway a lot when I was younger” she said. “But then came L.A. and children. . . . And out of the blue I got this call to do this play of Richard’s with the idea that after all this time I’d be back on the stage in New York which I missed desperately. So all of these things I’d been dreaming of happened and with it came so much fear and anxiety: ‘Can I make it work?’ ” She laughed at the idea of what fear and anxiety meant a few days earlier—having too much to memorize.“The play is about family and struggle and old hurts and people having to be in this sort of Sartre way perpetually closed off in the space of one room with each other” she continued. “So now the play and the reality are one in ways I could never have imagined. Except I don’t get to do it in this world with an audience.” The evocative set designed by Santo Loquasto of a New York town house has not yet been struck from the Manhattan Theatre Club stage she said. “So all of us keep thinking of that set and how we want to get to it be on it—the company even without an audience just to work together on it. Actors are not people who know how to isolate. We are suddenly physically frozen at this moment.”The young musical-theatre actress Abena Mensah-Bonsu cast in a significant role in a new show “Nollywood Dreams” had been commuting in from New Jersey feeling all the ancient excitement of a big break. Now she sits at home and is eager to get back to the theatre. “Acting is the opposite of social distancing” she said echoing Levine. “Even if you’re introverted as I am. So when we sit in place we long to be engaged with someone.” On Broadway the theatres are empty but the lights have still been on as though the theatres were willing the shows to continue.One irony of this pandemic is that while it exposes the gaps in our social and medical safety nets it also punishes people for behaving well. Communities with the healthiest intergenerational relationships seem to be at greater risk than those that sequester older people in nursing homes. Italy one study shows has been so hard hit by the coronavirus because there the young and the old have the beautiful habit of mingling together. Grandparents are accustomed to being with their grandchildren.In the days before the shutdown the Lubavitcher community in Crown Heights became a virus hot spot perhaps because the Hasidic sects too have kept at bay the alienation of generations that is so much part of American life. “Do you want to know how things appear or how they are?” Mica Soffer the editor of a Jewish news Web site said that Sunday. “It’s been extremely hectic. As far as the community itself I guess we weren’t so much prepared. It’s in China it’s in Europe—we didn’t realize how quickly it would get here. Our community is so connected. We live in an urban area—you’re always around people. It’s Brooklyn after all! Late last week I had a shiva call a wedding and an engagement party. Everyone has a million things they need to go to—families are large.”She went on “Most families here have elderly parents and grandparents—it’s a big part of life. Purim was last weekend—you’re talking about people being exposed. We didn’t realize at first. We didn’t know. There was a lot of contact. Very much part of our day-to-day life—especially with the men going to shul three times a day and Torah classes every single day. One of the things that’s so amazing is that everybody kicked into high gear to put up yeshivas online within two days.“In Crown Heights davening still goes on it always has to be there within the realm of whatever number the health department says. No more than ten people in Israel. A rabbi told me ‘Faith is not the absence of reason.’ We don’t give up on the interventions. God blessed us with doctors not as something apart from us but as something there to help us. My father told me this: God is in charge and God watches over us. Every time I get really panicky there’s that sense that God is taking care of us. I’m an anxious person and it’s not easy. But I have to access that. Rabbi Nachum said ‘Gam zu l’tovah’—‘This too shall be for the good.’ ” On Tuesday rabbis closed the Crown Heights synagogues. “Now” Soffer said “many people are praying outdoors six feet away from each other.”The self-exile of the very wealthy from the city that made them rich is hardly uniform. A feeling of social responsibility of solidarity is embodied by Elizabeth Smith who is the head of the Central Park Conservancy. She and her husband Rick Cotton the head of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey became among the first public officials in New York known to have covid-19. Now all she wants is to get back to the Park.“I’ve never been in the tabloids before” Smith who is in her late sixties said from her Manhattan apartment where she was convalescing and in her second week of seclusion. “In my family you’re in the paper when you’re born and again when you marry. And the fact of the matter is that the virus gets . . . very virulent. I wasn’t feeling well on Saturday—all the typical flu symptoms like a fever but a relatively mild case of the flu for me. I stayed in bed had my moments of panic but I was fortunate to be paired with Rick who was positive but asymptomatic. And I was well enough to stay in touch with the Conservancy and find out how everyone was faring—the morale and the health of the staff—and the Park itself too. It has the tremendous power of offering peace and respite to people. The amazing people are the city workers. They keep showing up. They show up at work and they do the right thing. There are lots of selfless people lots of people who take public service seriously.”Even if she hadn’t fallen ill Smith said she would have wanted to stay in the city. “We have a big responsibility to the public” she said. “You know when Frederick Law Olmsted made the Park it was just with that in mind: most people don’t even have a chance of leaving New York. It’s for all those people who couldn’t leave the city to get to the Adirondacks.” Smith is the chair of the Library of America which published a collection of Olmsted’s essays letters and other reflections in 2015. “Believe it or not I never quite got through Olmsted’s writings” she admitted. “He was a genius and a beautiful writer.” She is now immersed in the volume: “I’m not in the Park but I can stay in the Park.”Emptiness and absence contradict the very concept of the city. The point of a city is social proximity; to see people deliberately spaced out like the walking but never intersecting figures in a Giacometti is to see what cities aren’t. In a historical sense cities are always organisms of a kind like coral reefs where a lot of people come together to barter spices and exchange ideas and find mates and endure the recurrent damage of infectious disease.The question is whether the current upheavals could somehow alter New York forever. Some beloved places may stay closed. Some new practices may be perpetuated. The digital trends toward disaggregation of experience may get a boost at a cost to everything we love about the city. There’s an eerie gap between the raucous and argumentative world of the Internet and the silence of the streets. Outside new patterns of wider spacing and greater caution assert themselves: Is that masked man contagious and to be avoided by crossing the street? Did we forget to sanitize after touching the gate to the park? And with them the terrible self-monitoring of plague times: Do I feel normal? Is my temperature high? Feel my forehead.Until last week no one ever thought that Camus’s “The Plague” was about the plague. It was the text through which generations of high schoolers were taught how not to read literally. It was always taken as a fable or an allegory specifically of the German occupation of France. The people in Camus’s plague town of Oran did not in any way deserve to suffer from the disease but the crisis revealed all the various human responses of cowardice denial and courage. The point was not that actual plagues tell us much but that the pressure of extreme and unexpected events forces the flaws in our common character to the surface.This plague has proved an equal-opportunity evil striking theocratic states like Iran and authoritarian ones like China and more open ones like our own and those in Europe. Some hard balance of authority and openness is obviously essential to going on at all but this is not news. We have always known that having the confidence to act and the clarity to see if the way we act is good is vital to our continued existence. Our continued existence! It used to be a kind of metaphor really meaning “the easy perpetuation of our familiar way of life.” No more.By midweek even the dance of wariness was muted: New Yorkers largely sheltering in place still allowed themselves to walk their dogs but walked them alone on each street with the next dog and owner at least a stoplight away. The dogs puzzled not to have the greetings of others of their animal kind sniffed doggedly in the dark though now only at the scent of their solitary owners.
340,Life on Lockdown in China,Peter Hessler,The New Yorker,-2,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/30/life-on-lockdown-in-china,"On the twenty-seventh day of the coronavirus lockdown in Chengdu, in southwestern China, five masked men appeared in the lobby of my apartment building in order to deliver a hundred-inch TCL Xclusive television. It was late morning, and I was taking my nine-year-old twin daughters, Ariel and Natasha, outside to get some air. The three of us also were wearing surgical masks, and we stopped to watch the deliverymen. I had never seen such an enormous TV; it arrived in an eight-foot-long box that weighed more than three hundred pounds. Two of the deliverymen stood inside an elevator with a tape measure, trying to figure out whether the box would fit. Otherwise, it was going to be a long haul up the stairs to the twenty-eighth floor.By that point, the country was deep into the most ambitious quarantine in history, with at least seven hundred and sixty million people confined largely to their homes. The legal groundwork had been established on January 20th, when the National Health Commission designated the highest level of treatment and control to fight the new coronavirus, which eventually became known as covid-19. After that, provinces and municipalities issued their own regulations, and the Chengdu government passed its first measures on January 24th. They were tightened seven days later, when it became clear that the epidemic had reached a point of crisis: during that week, the number of reported deaths in China had increased more than sixfold. By the end of January, there were a total of 11,791 confirmed cases, with two hundred and fifty-nine deaths.The New Yorker’s coronavirus news coverage and analysis are free for all readers.My family rents an apartment in a nine-building complex not far from the center of Chengdu, where I teach writing at a local university. We chose the place, last September, primarily for its location: the apartment blocks are situated beside a pleasant, tree-lined stretch of the Fu River, and there’s a subway stop outside one of the side gates. But, after the quarantine began, the subway was deserted and both side entrances were chained shut. Anybody who arrived at the main gate was greeted by an infrared temperature gun to the forehead. The gun was wielded by a government-assigned volunteer in a white hazmat suit, and, behind him, a turnstile led to a thick plastic mat soaked with a bleach solution. A sign read “Shoe Sole Disinfecting Area,” and there was always a trail of wet prints leading away from the mat, like a footbath at a public swimming pool.Compared with other places, our compound’s restrictions were relatively light. We could leave and return as often as we pleased, provided that we carried passes that had been issued by the neighborhood committee, the most local level of the Communist Party. The majority of my friends in other parts of China were restricted to one individual per household going out every two days, and often that person had to tell the authorities where she was headed. Even at our complex, which has few foreign residents, it was rare for people to go outside. All restaurants, government offices, and most shops had been closed, and, after the Lunar New Year holiday ended, in February, all schools would be suspended indefinitely. One of the new Chengdu measures even banned “every sort of group dinner party.”Most of my neighbors ordered things on Taobao, one of the world’s biggest e-commerce sites, and they got their food delivered from Fresh Hema, a nationwide grocery chain that has a branch nearby. (Both Taobao and Hema are owned by the Alibaba Group, a Chinese technology company.) All day, motorcycle deliverymen handed off items to the security guards, who trundled through the compound’s grounds with dollies and shopping carts, dropping off boxes and bags. In my lobby, the most packages I counted at any time was a hundred and twenty-five, all of them marked with apartment numbers in black ink. Sometimes it was possible to see what was inside. On the morning that the Xclusive TV was delivered, the contents of other packages reinforced the impression that people had settled in for the long haul: two electric power strips for Apartment 1101, three bottles of Omo laundry detergent for 3003, a huge box of fresh ginger for 3704.I tried to strike up a conversation with one of the TV deliverymen. He was standing near the elevator door, and he wore his surgical mask in the position that I call “the holster.” This is when a man keeps the straps around his ears but pulls the mask down beneath his chin, usually so that he can spit or smoke a cigarette. Another Chengdu measure demanded that citizens stop spitting, but I still occasionally saw people holstering their masks and hawking loogies. I asked the deliveryman what he would do if the TV wouldn’t fit inside the elevator.“It’ll fit,” he said. “No problem.”He pulled the mask back over his face. People were much warier of strangers than usual, and sometimes if I got in the elevator with another resident he turned his back to me. Most people were aware that our compound was, at least by local standards, a hot spot. On the various apps that mapped the government-issued statistics for coronavirus cases, our compound lit up bright red. There had been a positive test for a resident somewhere in the complex—the only one in our neighborhood.The deliverymen weren’t making fast progress with the TV, and Ariel and Natasha were eager to leave, so we went out the gate. Next to the river, a long row of ride-share bikes had hardly been touched for weeks, and I used my phone to unlock one. The twins liked the challenge of riding the adult-size bikes—they took turns wobbling along the empty riverside path. After that, we visited the zombie subway station. It was still operating, but the place was silent except for a public-service message, played on an endless loop, that warned nonexistent passengers to watch their step. Ariel and Natasha ran up and down all the escalators in the wrong direction, laughing. This was our usual morning routine during the lockdown. They hadn’t seen another child their age for nearly a month.After we returned to the compound, and had the infrared gun pointed at our foreheads, and crossed the bleach footbath, the deliverymen were returning with the empty box on a dolly. The man wearing the holster explained that once they’d removed the top half of the box and stood the TV on its end they’d been able to fit it in the elevator. He still didn’t seem very eager to talk.Last September, my wife, Leslie, and I enrolled the girls in the third grade at a local public school, in part so they would learn Chinese. Like the other students, they also took English, and Unit 2 in their textbook was titled “My Body.” All anatomical vocabulary was taught in the context of injuries, illnesses, or mishaps. There were cartoons of children lying in hospital beds, with labels that identified the patient, the age, and the symptom: “Bill—8 years old—foot hurts”; “Ben—10 years old—leg hurts”; “Lily—9 years old—ear hurts.” One lesson read:In the morning, I play with Lucky. He bites my hand! It really hurts.At lunchtime, I bite my tongue. It really hurts.In the afternoon, I play football with Andy. He kicks my leg. It really hurts.This is a very bad day!For weeks, Ariel and Natasha returned home imitating the class’s taped dialogues, which invariably ended with the phrase “I’m going to the hospital!” It seemed to confirm an unscientific impression that I’ve long held of the Chinese view of health: namely, that people are even more fearful about children’s safety here than they are in other places I’ve lived. My daughters often complained that at recess the simple jungle-gym equipment at their school was strictly limited to sixth graders, because teachers believed that younger children would injure themselves.After the epidemic began, though, I saw that recurring phrase—“I’m going to the hospital!”—in a new light. The textbook was accurate: if somebody’s ear hurts, often her only option is to go straight to the hospital. In China, there’s no comprehensive primary-care system, which is one reason that the coronavirus spiralled out of control so quickly in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, where the epidemic started. Some of the most awful images from the early days were videos of mob scenes at hospitals, where terrified citizens, many of them sick, clamored to be tested and treated. Contact in these crowds undoubtedly accelerated the rate of infection.A number of the earliest cases occurred in people who worked at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which sold live fish and animals. Epidemiologists told me that they still don’t know the nature of the spillover event—the moment when the disease leaped from animals to humans. Scientists believe that the virus began in bats and likely passed through an intermediate host; some speculate that this may have been pangolins, scaly anteaters that are sometimes consumed as a delicacy in China. “Set oven to five hundred degrees. While preheating, get stepladder and turn off smoke alarm. Then season brisket, chop herb medley, and turn off smoke alarm again. Resume chopping herb medley, peel potatoes, slip off stepladder while angrily trying to remove the battery from the smoke alarm . . .”Cartoon by Lars KensethBy December, the disease had started to spread among people. Some early victims included medical staff who, unaware that they were dealing with a new strain of virus, lacked appropriate protective gear. In Wuhan, a small number of doctors tried to report what they were seeing, but officials suppressed their comments. Li Wenliang, an ophthalmologist, warned his colleagues via WeChat. Li was subsequently summoned by the police, who forced him to sign a confession saying that he had “seriously disturbed the social order.” Li became seen as a martyr after his death from the disease was announced, on February 7th, and local officials eventually issued an apology to his family.The coverup gave the virus more time to spread unabated. But, in early January, once Chinese health officials grasped the seriousness of the situation, they moved quickly. “Within three days, they had scientists who were able to sequence and characterize the structure of the virus, which is unheard of,” Wafaa El-Sadr, the director of icap, a global-health center at Columbia University, told me. She said that recent advances in technology made the sequencing possible, a crucial step that allowed scientists to develop ways to diagnose the disease and to start to identify methods of treatment.But for Wuhan it was already too late, because the first wave of infections overburdened hospitals. With many health-care workers falling sick, and with an urgent need for more support, reinforcements were sent from other parts of China. During the quarantine, I sometimes talked on the phone with an I.C.U. physician from Huaxi, a Chengdu hospital that is recognized as the best facility in southwestern China. After volunteering to go to Wuhan, seven hundred miles east of Chengdu, the I.C.U. physician was assigned to the Red Cross hospital, which is less than a mile from the seafood market where the virus first took hold.“It was like the epicenter,” he told me, during one of our conversations. “There are a little more than four hundred beds, but they were getting two thousand patients a day. They were adding beds, and some sick people just found places to lie down.”Like other people in Wuhan with whom I communicated, the doctor asked me not to use his name. Since the initial coverup, the Chinese government has seemed determined to report numbers openly, but it still attempts to control the human narrative. “Keep yourself politically disciplined,” an internal notice from Xiangya Hospital, an institution in Hunan Province, informed staff who had gone to Wuhan. “Do not talk to outsiders in private.”The I.C.U. physician was one of about two hundred Huaxi staff who had been sent to Wuhan, and when I talked to him on February 22nd he said that none of his colleagues had been infected. He seemed confident that they would stay healthy, and he attributed the high death rate in Wuhan to the time it took to recognize a new disease. The difference from the rest of China was striking: on February 29th, when the government issued an analysis of more than fifty-five thousand confirmed cases, 5.8 per cent in Wuhan had resulted in death, compared with 0.7 per cent in other parts of China. The latter number seemed likely to decline significantly over time—in part because treatment was improving, but also because the early testing didn’t include many people who were mildly sick or asymptomatic. (The percentage of infections that are asymptomatic is one of the major unanswered questions about the virus.)The reaction of medical staff in Wuhan was sometimes angry. I frequently exchanged messages with a Wuhan hospital pharmacist whom I’ll call Zhang, who had seen a dozen colleagues fall sick. One remained in critical care. “We didn’t have enough protective devices and we weren’t cautious enough,” he wrote. When I asked about the root cause of the epidemic, he was blunt:My personal opinion is that the government has always been careless and they suppressed dissent. Those are two of the direct causes. Because of this, they lost the golden opportunity to control the virus. . . . I don’t believe the state-run media or read their reports. On the contrary, I pay more attention to what my friends say. You asked about my first reaction? In fact, even now I am not very frightened by this disease. I just take necessary precautions. But I’m worried sick that if I get it I might infect my family.Zhang was still working long hours, and he had a wife and an eleven-year-old daughter at home. He had considered checking into a hotel to isolate himself from family, but the few places that remained open required special approval; the city had been shut down more completely than anyplace else in China. Fearing a run on necessary goods, the government had stepped in. Like Chengdu, Wuhan is the capital of a populous inland province, but now the two cities seemed to belong to different worlds, different eras. A few days after the hundred-inch TV passed through my lobby, Zhang described how Wuhan’s neighborhood committees had taken charge of all purchasing and delivery arrangements:Our basic needs are met (at least food and clothing are enough). It feels like the era of planned economy when I was little. . . . There are barely any cigarettes, alcohol, tea, snacks, drinks, or pet food available. Maybe things will get better later, who knows?On the thirty-ninth day of the lockdown, the packages in my lobby included a box of houseplants for 3703 and some flowers for 2903. It was now March, and sometimes I saw people on their balconies, tending plants. But it still seemed rare for residents to leave the compound. When women went downstairs to pick up packages, it wasn’t unusual for them to be dressed in pajamas, even in the afternoon. In the lobby, management provided a spray bottle of seventy-five-per-cent-alcohol solution, and sometimes I saw a masked, pajama-clad resident standing in a puddle of the stuff, spraying her hands, packages, shopping bags, whatever.People rarely spoke in these situations. There were no greetings, no jokes, no moments of commiseration. Part of it was the masks, which were an obsession. On my floor, residents wore them even if they were merely dropping off garbage, ten feet from their door. Mask-wearing, after all, was required by the new measures, and people were diligent: I often saw motorcycle deliverymen helmetless and fiddling with their phones at thirty miles an hour, their masks safely in place. When I went running along the river at dawn, the few other people who were out sometimes shouted at me for being bare-faced. Ariel and Natasha despised the things, and I gave them permission to go with the low-rider—this is when you pretend that you are obeying the rules but actually tug the mask down so that your nostrils are uncovered.Health-care professionals told me that masks have no value in uncrowded outdoor settings, where infection isn’t a risk, and most people wore them improperly even when they weren’t holstering or low-riding. The notion of these things playing a talismanic role isn’t new. In “The Plague,” published in 1947, Albert Camus described two characters in a hospital:He opened one and took two gauze masks out of a sterilizer, offered one to Rambert and asked him to put it on. The journalist asked if it served any purpose and Tarrou said no, but that it inspired confidence in others.Masks also make it easier for people to ignore one another. If residents passed me in the courtyard, they avoided eye contact; some wore see-through plastic gloves and surgical booties in addition to the masks. These costumes of the quarantine, along with all the other restrictions, helped turn citizens inward, and people directed their energy toward whatever space was left to them. Among the packages in my lobby, I noticed many home furnishings and cleaning implements: a Pincai-brand storage cabinet for 602, a Deema vacuum cleaner for 2304, a giant carpet, wrapped in tape and plastic, for 303. There was home-office equipment (wireless mouse, 4201; file cabinets, 301). By the forty-fourth day, somebody in 3704 had felt the need to buy an electric footbath machine from Kosaka. (“Powerful by Dreams.”)From what I could tell, the lockdown diet of my neighbors was remarkably healthy. If quarantined Americans were forced to survive on delivery food, health officials would want to track the X curve of body-mass index rising across the drop in coronavirus cases. In Chengdu, though, my neighbors were obviously cooking: lots of fresh vegetables and fruit. I never saw evidence of alcohol going anywhere other than 1901: my apartment. The government had strategically allowed cigarette and alcohol shops to remain open—these were among the very few places of business that never shut down. But, when I talked to store owners in my neighborhood, they said that sales were terrible. There are many types of loneliness in this world, but it’s a unique sensation to feel that you are the only individual in a forty-three-story building who is drinking his way through a quarantine.I seldom saw children. I knew they were up there: a Mini Table Football game to 2703, a Huanqi toybox to 1804. The compound printed out documents on request, and sometimes the lobby contained homework assignments for kids who were attending school online: for 2102, a chapter on chemistry; for 3802, a handout on poems from the Northern and Southern dynasties. But, in the early weeks of the lockdown, children didn’t even venture into the courtyard, because parents were so frightened of the disease. I had no idea what they were doing for exercise. Even with our trips to the bikes and the subway station, I usually put my daughters on our treadmill every three days or so. In Wuhan, Zhang the pharmacist was also doing the best he could:People who spend a lot of time in a confined space tend to become lazy and depressed. It’s not easy to motivate them. I’m now teaching my daughter to practice Ping-Pong against the living-room wall. My childhood school didn’t have so many Ping-Pong tables. We used to do that a lot. Now she is quite skilled at it. Other times, I encourage her to stand up and play the guitar, moving to the beat, like a real band guitarist.It was widely acknowledged that China’s measures had been remarkably effective at halting the advance of the disease. In mid-February, the World Health Organization sent twenty-five Chinese and international experts to visit medical facilities around the country, including in Wuhan and Chengdu. In a subsequent report, the W.H.O. announced, “In the face of a previously unknown virus, China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile, and aggressive disease containment effort in history.” One member of the delegation, Dale Fisher, a professor of medicine who specializes in infectious disease at the National University of Singapore, told me that China’s actions prevented hundreds of thousands of cases and thousands of deaths. “I can look at the epidemic curve,” he said, citing the government-issued statistics. “I can look at the trajectory it had and the trajectory that appeared after January 23rd, and there’s no doubt.”But other scientists wondered about the sustainability of the effort. Wafaa El-Sadr, the epidemiologist at Columbia, told me that drastic measures had been necessary in Wuhan, because the health-care system had been so overburdened. But she wasn’t certain that the same approach made sense in a place like Chengdu, which had a population of sixteen million and had seen a hundred and forty-three cases and three deaths by the beginning of March. “You don’t need to have a complete shutdown of a city like Chengdu,” she said. “What you need is very focussed intervention. Identify cases early, and manage them and their contacts appropriately.”Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, believed that China’s quarantine would inevitably be a temporary solution. “As soon as schools open, and as soon as people get back to work, and as soon as people start circulating in the world—China is a global country—the virus will be back,” she told me. “I don’t fully understand what the endgame is in terms of these measures.”Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist who directs the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, at Harvard University, was more positive about China’s strategy. But he noted that the next step was difficult—he compared it to letting the air out of a balloon slowly. “I think it will bounce back,” he said, of the virus. “But you will have delayed things, and, if you don’t let it bounce back too much before you put the clamps on again, then you may spare the hospitals from getting overwhelmed. But it’s a really painful process, and people are going to get tired of it.”In the meantime, there were no announcements of how long schools would be closed, or when the lockdown might be lifted. Many measures seemed likely to continue indefinitely. Every day before noon, like many workers across the country, I was required to take my temperature and submit it in a standardized form to my employer. The form also required me to testify that I’d had no personal contact with people from Wuhan or elsewhere in Hubei in the past fourteen days.That part was easy, because it was rare to have an old-fashioned mask-to-mask conversation with anybody. Apart from home life, my interactions were mostly by e-mail, phone, or WeChat, and often the subject of these exchanges was the isolation itself. A former student of mine wrote, after her husband returned to his factory job, “When it’s time to work, he needs to wear a gas mask that covers the whole head.” She described the scene during lunch break:[He] takes a seat alone at a table, which is set far apart from another one. And he has to face the same way as other workers. No talking. People say on Internet that the way they eat reminds them of the way they took the College Entrance Examination.I taught all my writing classes online. I had met only one of the students before, and I never saw any of their faces. We interacted over audio and text. I tried to have discussions, but it was time-consuming to switch back and forth between different microphones; the classes were too large to have everybody on at once. Last semester, the students had lived in dormitories in Chengdu, but now they were scattered across the country, in their home towns. The most distant was in Jilin, not far from Siberia. Of my sixty-plus students, nobody personally knew someone who had contracted the virus. A number of them told me that they had not set foot outside their apartments for more than a month.Quite a few had learned to cook. One boy happily reported that, because his home had a treadmill and some dumbbells, he had lost twenty pounds. Another described a day when he and his father, after a month of being restricted to their building, took turns cutting each other’s hair. Some had been reading books or watching movies and shows that made them think about fear or claustrophobia: “Chernobyl,” “Parasite,” and another South Korean movie, called “Flu.”For the first week of class, I assigned John Cheever’s “The Enormous Radio.” In the story, a couple acquire a radio that allows them to listen to the conversations in other apartments in their building. After reading it, my students mentioned things that they had noticed around their homes: how people cringed if you happened to cough in the elevator, or how, when there was a report that a family was under observation for the virus, they were shunned by neighbors. There were also moments of brightness: one student described how the rooftop of his apartment block had become a communal space for people to relax and socialize, because they were restricted from leaving the building. Some students reported that the experience of the past month had brought them closer to their parents. Any complaints tended to be leavened with humor. One student began a paper:This is a really special time. Almost all the people in China have to lock themselves at home, just because of a tiny coronavirus. People hate this coronavirus, hate bats carrying this coronavirus, and hate other people who eat these bats.At the entrance to my compound, the Communist Party’s neighborhood committee erected a series of information boards. They displayed the new epidemic measures, along with an organizational chart for an entity called the Communist Party Service Team for Home Quarantine. Head shots and cell-phone numbers of seven officials were included. I had never lived anywhere in China where such information was posted in public. “I think my dad is losing his memory—he keeps forgetting to say he’s proud of me.”Cartoon by Zachary KaninOne afternoon, I dialled the number at the top of the chart. The quarantine-team leader picked up immediately, and, after I introduced myself, she promised to arrange an interview; within an hour, I received a call from the neighborhood committee’s Party secretary. He told me to stop by his office the following morning, which was a Saturday.Our conversation was masked on both sides. He was middle-aged, a serious man in a blue blazer with a safety-pinned armband that said “Party Member Service Team.” He had grown up in the neighborhood, where his father had also worked for the government. The old man had come out of retirement to don a hazmat suit during the epidemic—he was one of the volunteers who checked temperatures in front of apartment buildings.The office contained a narrow vinyl-covered couch, and the Party secretary told me that he had slept there for the first two weeks of the quarantine, when he was working from 8 a.m. to midnight every day. His home was in a distant northern suburb, and he couldn’t afford the time to commute. In Chengdu, there are 1,685 neighborhood committees, and each had prepared a quarantine team like the one near my home. Most details of our local lockdown—the information boards, the hazmat thermometer workers—had been managed by the team, which consisted of thirty-eight people, mostly volunteers. In a jurisdiction of nearly six thousand residents, there had been exactly one case of coronavirus: the person in my compound.The Party secretary explained that the resident had travelled to his home town, in Hubei, during the Lunar New Year holiday. In the early days of the epidemic, the government tracked such links so intensively that locals became terrified by the sight of a car with Hubei plates. Many Chengdu hotels turned away guests from Wuhan, so the government finally designated twelve lodgings to accept them. A friend of mine in another part of the city passed along a WeChat conversation that had occurred among people in her compound:Resident 1: Yesterday somebody said there was a car with Hubei plates at the underground car park of Building 2.Property Management: O.K., I will send somebody immediately to check it out.Resident 2: What the fuck? This is not funny!Resident 1: Please have the door guard pay attention . . .Resident 2: I think that now we should show our I.D. card to go in and out!!!Resident 3: Quickly, call 110 [police] or 120 [emergency ambulance].In my neighborhood, the Party team organized periodic door-to-door surveys, which was how they learned of the resident’s Hubei trip. Thus far, people had come to my apartment three times, and they always asked about Hubei and Wuhan. Their policy was to call the community’s Health Service Center if anybody had visited those places.“They came and checked his temperature—it was 37.1,” the Party secretary told me, using the Celsius figure. (The temperature was normal.) “He didn’t feel sick, but the health officials tested him for the coronavirus, and it was positive.” Later, the man showed mild symptoms, which meant that the team had caught him at a critical time: he’d appeared normal but may have been contagious. He spent ten days under observation in the hospital, and then he was quarantined at home for fourteen days.I asked the Party secretary when we would be allowed to enter our compound without the passes, and he said, “I think it will be two fourteen-day periods.” He seemed to think in this unit of time, which is the standard span of a stringent quarantine. He estimated that my daughters’ school wouldn’t resume until mid- or late April—three more fourteen-day units. When I asked if there had been much resistance to the new policies, he shook his head. “Ninety per cent of the population agrees,” he said. “We have some people who think it’s not convenient, and they want to go out and play mah-jongg or something. But most people follow the rules.”From what I had seen, he wasn’t exaggerating. The overwhelming compliance was one of the most impressive features of the lockdown, along with the dedication of grassroots officials. In Wuhan, the government had sent eighteen hundred teams of epidemiologists, each consisting of at least five people, to trace the contacts of infected citizens. The W.H.O. report noted that the containment effort had been possible because of “the deep commitment of the Chinese people to collective action.” At the individual level, though, people occasionally expressed reservations. During one of my exchanges with Zhang, the pharmacist in Wuhan, I mentioned that most people I knew were supportive. He wrote back:Everyone grumbles a lot, but everyone obeys the rules strictly. It’s very contradictory, but it’s China. Our cultural traditions dictate our thinking. We will use the word “victory” to describe the final end of the epidemic, although I personally don’t like that description.It was common for Chinese leaders to speak in such terms—President Xi Jinping had declared that the country would “defeat the virus.” Eventually, President Trump’s Twitter feed would adopt a similar tone. (“we will win!”) I asked Zhang to explain what he meant.There is a bad tendency in China right now for the state propaganda department to turn what should be remembered as a sad incident into a comforting one. They are accustomed to using the word “victory” toward everything, the so-called man can conquer nature. I don’t think there is joy in such an incident. So many people died, and their families won’t think this is a victory whatsoever.During the lockdown, the Ministry of Education estimated that more than two hundred and twenty million children and adolescents had been confined to their homes. At our daughters’ school, for the first three weeks of the semester there were no online classes for the younger grades, although they were given some materials, including a school project titled “The Coronavirus and Everybody’s Battle Against the Epidemic.” Then the school started holding short lessons online, but Leslie and I thought that children of that age shouldn’t be engaged in remote learning.We organized things as best we could, using the school’s assignments and finding other projects. Ariel and Natasha usually worked well in the morning, and then, around ten or eleven o’clock, when we started to hear sounds of roughhousing, I took them out for our morning walk. In the afternoon, we sent them to play in the compound courtyard, where it was common for passersby to lecture them about the dangers of being outdoors or of wearing their masks improperly. The latter criticism probably should have been directed at me,"
341,“It Spreads Like Wildfire”: The Coronavirus Comes to New York’s Prisons, Daniel A. Gross,The New Yorker,-2,https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/it-spreads-like-wildfire-covid-19-comes-to-new-yorks-prisons,Last week Adam Roberts who has been incarcerated in New York State since 1999 began to prepare for the arrival of covid-19 the respiratory infection caused by the novel coronavirus at Fishkill Correctional Facility in Beacon. He began washing his hands more often and keeping his distance from men in the mess hall; he noticed someone in a common area using a TV remote through a plastic bag. Roberts has an intolerance to dairy and worries about losing access to foods he can eat so he planned to buy as much instant ramen tuna mayonnaise peanut butter and tea from the commissary as he could. “It seems like things are slowly shutting down” he told me on Thursday. “Funny that prison may be safer than the outside—until that is covid inevitably finds its way in here. At which point it spreads like wildfire.”The coronavirus has now found its way into New York’s prison system. On Sunday the state’s Department of Corrections and Community Supervision or D.O.C.C.S. confirmed that two prisoners at Wende Correctional Facility had tested positive for covid-19. (One of them according to multiple reports is the former movie producer Harvey Weinstein who was sent to the facility only recently after being convicted of rape.) Health officials in Cayuga County announced that the coronavirus had infected a man who had been incarcerated at Auburn Correctional Facility. D.O.C.C.S. has also confirmed three cases of covid-19 in its ranks: one officer at Sing Sing Correctional Facility another at Shawangunk Correctional Facility and one civilian staff member in Albany.“It is absolutely impossible to practice social distancing in prison” Laron Rogers who is serving twenty-five years to life at Sing Sing wrote to me on Wednesday a day after officials confirmed that the Sing Sing officer had tested positive for covid-19. Rogers learned about the positive test from his peers not the prison administration. “As you might imagine we are extremely concerned with the lack of information concerning a contingency plan” he said. “We all feel like it is only a matter of time before this virus enters and spreads rapidly in here.” At the time Rogers said many correctional officers were not wearing rubber gloves even when collecting large numbers of I.D. cards or patting men down for contraband. (The D.O.C.C.S. did not respond to a request for comment on this matter.)Preparations for the coronavirus have now seeped into nearly every aspect of life in state prisons according to about a dozen incarcerated sources in five different facilities. Ten days ago D.O.C.C.S. closed all its prisons to visitors—with the exception of non-contact legal visits—and issued each prisoner five postage stamps two electronic messages and one free phone call per week. (Roberts had been expecting a visit from his cousins their first in more than a year.) Prisons are distributing bleach and have been posting memos that encourage hand washing. But experts say that none of these measures can prevent a widespread outbreak of covid-19. “It’s nearly impossible to provide infection control in these settings” Gregg Gonsalves an epidemiology professor at Yale School of Public Health who has researched access to treatment for hepatitis C in state prisons told me. “If you wanted to set up a situation that would promote rapid transmission of a respiratory virus you would say prison: it’s close quarters unsanitary individuals in frequent contact.” Across the state prisoners are trying to stand a few feet apart in long lines and crowded mess halls; educational and vocational programs have been cancelled—though some jobs have not.“All programs have been cancelled except the Soap Shop” Shakim Allah who has been incarcerated for forty-three years wrote to me from Great Meadow Correctional Facility in Comstock. Earlier this month about a week after New York reported its first case of covid-19 and when stores were beginning to run out of toilet paper and hand sanitizer Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that incarcerated workers had begun producing a state-branded hand sanitizer called NYS Clean. The soap shop is part of Corcraft a state entity that pays workers between sixteen and sixty-five cents per hour and has been operating around the clock at Great Meadow. “There are major complaints about the conditions men are being forced to work under as well as pay” Allah told me. He said that men are working eight-hour shifts and have been promised letters of commendation from the Governor. Allah also alleged that some workers have been unable to punch time cards to record their hours worked have worked double shifts or have worked on the expectation of future pay. Until recently alcohol-based hand sanitizer was not available in state prisons even to the workers who produced it; late last week a journalist asked Cuomo about the issue and D.O.C.C.S. announced that it would begin to distribute sanitizer in common areas.Victor Garcia who is also incarcerated at Great Meadow serving fifty-five years to life told me that fears of an outbreak have grown by the day. He wrote that staff members had distributed spray bottles of bleach and extra bars of soap; only two men were allowed to sit at mess-hall tables that were previously used for four. “It seems like the department is doing everything in its power to keep the virus from entering and spreading” he said. Still he has been alarmed by news reports about the rapid spread of covid-19 and worries about his family especially his ninety-six-year-old grandmother. “I have never experienced this level of panic coming from our families corrections staff government and the media” he told me.At Bedford Hills Correctional Facility the state’s largest women’s prison officials have been distributing bleach and telling women to wash their hands avoid groups and sick people and cough into a tissue; movement between housing units was cut off on March 17th according to Misha Louis a member of the prison’s Inmate Liaison Committee. The restrictions initially caused an uproar Louis said and some women experienced anxiety attacks. “We are keeping each other strong” she told me. Another woman at the prison who earns about a quarter per hour distributing bleach said on March 20th that most programs had closed but that general medical appointments had not stopped and that incarcerated women were still working at a D.M.V. call center located at the prison. She had been working overtime every day for a week. “I’m tired but I love my job” she told me. Women were eager to protect themselves by cleaning their living spaces the woman said but some officers were allegedly hoarding the bleach that her crew was distributing. “There’s an unspoken understanding amongst us as inmates too that if we were to fall terribly ill precious resources may not be ‘wasted’ to save one of our lives” she said.When I asked D.O.C.C.S. about preparations for the coronavirus a spokesperson told me that every facility has an emergency control plan and that state prisons were used to dealing with infectious diseases such as tuberculosis hepatitis influenza and H.I.V./AIDS. (All of these infections spread in different ways and at different rates than the coronavirus and can be treated with medication.) “At all times D.O.C.C.S. retains supplies equipment and other resources that can be readily available if needed to those impacted in correctional facilities during the spread of an infectious disease” the spokesperson said. “Additionally the Department has medical staff specially trained in infection control employed in facilities across the state.” According to the Correctional Association of New York which oversees D.O.C.C.S. emergency control plans are considered security directives and are not available to the public. (The association shared a hundred and seventy-five page D.O.C.C.S. manual on infectious diseases meant to guide employees on such practices as personal hygiene infection surveillance disinfection and decontamination and the use of personal protective equipment. It lists policies for the control of about twenty specific diseases.)On Friday I summarized my reporting for Gregg Gonsalves the epidemiologist and asked him whether he considered the prison system’s preparations sufficient. “You have a gaping wound and you’re giving a Band-Aid” he replied. Although the U.S. as a whole may be able to flatten the curve of the outbreak through social distancing Gonsalves said he expected to see in prisons jails and immigration detention centers a largely “uncontrolled unflattened curve” even if the incarcerated try to practice social distancing and have constant access to soap and hand sanitizer. Oluwadamilola Oladeru a resident at the Harvard Radiation Oncology Program who co-authored an op-ed with Gonsalves on the threat that covid-19 poses to those who are incarcerated pointed out that if the health system is overwhelmed people in prison may not only get sick from the coronavirus but may also lose access to ongoing care for chronic conditions such as diabetes and respiratory illnesses. The U.S. prison population currently includes more than a hundred and seventy thousand people over the age of fifty-five an age group that is particularly vulnerable to covid-19.“Sick inmates elderly and women who are not dangerous as well as parole violators should be released” Misha Louis wrote to me from Bedford Hills. “That way they will not be exposed in large numbers to the virus and take up hospital beds that the state does not have to spare.” She is not alone in calling for these steps: in the past week activists legislators judges public defenders and prosecutors have all advocated for decarceration to slow the spread of the pandemic. Gonsalves suggested medical furlough for elderly and at risk prisoners and the release of people near the end of their sentences. “You have to reduce the population load to reduce the risk of infection” he said.In Fishkill Adam Roberts had as normal a weekend as he could: he listened to coverage of covid-19 on the radio cooked apple turnovers and watched long stretches of Animal Planet which has become one of his go-to distractions. No inmates have tested positive at Fishkill but D.O.C.C.S. told the prison’s Inmate Liaison Committee that some men are under quarantine. For a few days now Roberts has been expecting the start of an outbreak. “I have to believe it’s here” he told me. “The numbers say it has to be here.”
342,Breaking Transmission: The Fight Against the Coronavirus Offers a Strategy for Cutting Carbon,Bill McKibben,The New Yorker,-2,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/breaking-transmission-the-fight-against-the-coronavirus-offers-a-strategy-for-cutting-carbon,We’ve all learned a good deal about epidemiology in the past few weeks. In particular the notion that staying at home can break chains of transmission and thereby interrupt the spread of the coronavirus is now ingrained in the minds of anyone who hasn’t been watching Fox News exclusively. My favorite graphic description of that action looks like this. And in places such as South Korea there are signs that it’s begun to work.Once you see something you start seeing it everywhere. Over the weekend I was reading a fine new book “Citizen Outlaw” about a New Haven gang leader turned gang-outreach officer who by talking down revenge-minded young men manages to interrupt the cycle of retaliation. “Jumping in at exactly the right time makes all the difference” the author Charles Barber explains. Barber who has written extensively on mental-health and criminal-justice issues cites studies showing that otherwise a single death can lead to a cascade of violence. In an Illinois study for instance “a single incident that was linked through the victim’s social networks to 469 separate violent incidents.”The coronavirus and gang violence are both examples of public-health problems where interrupting the spread of something once you figure out how to do it is fairly intuitive. But the logic holds I think for other realms including the fight against climate change. The mental image of breaking chains of transmission helps me understand intellectually some of the work that activists have been doing in the past decade and suggests strongly some paths to follow going forward.About ten years ago—after the defeat of congressional efforts to tackle climate change by pricing carbon through the Waxman-Markey bill—activists began working on a series of much smaller interventions. People in groups including 350.org (which I helped found) joined indigenous groups and farmers who were already fighting the Keystone XL pipeline which was intended to carry tar-sands oil from Alberta to the Gulf Coast and made it a national issue. They also began asking institutions to divest their stock holdings from fossil fuels.Many pundits thought such approaches were futile. An opinion piece in the Washington Post said that the Keystone fight was “an irrational and insulting litmus test for seriousness about climate change” that “made the environmental movement look capricious and immature” because “the real formidable task” was “transitioning the economy onto low- and no-emissions technology.” An allied group of doubters—the “that bus you took to the protest runs on gasoline!” critics—said that instead the emphasis should be on working to reduce people’s emissions.In retrospect it turns out that those actions were attempts to cut the chains of transmission that allowed the fossil-fuel industry to keep expanding. The Keystone fight was successful in stopping that pipeline at least so far. (Barack Obama rejected the pipeline and though Trump quickly reversed his ruling the work has not been completed. This week tribal groups are demanding the end to construction “man camps” in light of the virus.) The delay has been very useful: it has meant eight hundred thousand barrels a day of the dirtiest oil on earth not flowing down through Nebraska. But by itself obviously stopping the pipeline wouldn’t turn the tide against climate change. The good news is that as people watched that protest they decided to fight everything else too: now no fracking wells or coal mines or liquefied-natural-gas terminals get built without a fight. The most compelling of those battles—the standoff over the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock the kayaktivist blockade of Shell’s Arctic drilling rigs in Seattle and Portland harbors—get lots of coverage but around the globe every day similar fights are under way. They’ve slowed the growth of the fossil-fuels complex: the government of Alberta expected oil production in the tar sands to have quadrupled by this year but without pipelines to carry the crude it has had to impose production restrictions.Similarly divestment began small. The first institution to divest Unity College in Maine had a twelve-million-dollar endowment. Now funds worth more than twelve trillion dollars have divested from fossil fuels and oil and coal companies credit that with making their expansion difficult; it’s a brake on their acceleration. This is not the same of course as solving the problem any more than slowing the spread of coronavirus makes people healthy. covid-19 could just miraculously vanish (President Trump’s predicted solution) but we’d still have an unhealthy America. There is a great deal of work to be done on everything from health-care access to opioid addiction and nutrition. That kind of work is perhaps harder and definitely different. It’s utterly necessary that there are people working on the Green New Deal—and this week on a green economic stimulus. And engineers and entrepreneurs need to continue to make solar power cheaper. Over time these are the more important tasks than protest. But the success of that work depends on everyone else coming together in broad movements to break the political and economic power of the fossil-fuel industry.This means that we should keep looking for pressure points and opening up gaps in the chain that keeps the planet-wrecking industry thriving. Recently there has been a movement to get banks asset managers and insurance companies to stop steering cash to the carbon companies. And it’s beginning to work—financial institutions have started to limit their investments in coal-fired power in Arctic drilling and in the tar sands. None of this works overnight or entirely: as with the coronavirus relaxing vigilance means that transmission recurs. But it’s good to have a mental map of where we’re headed. If we can learn to slow the coronavirus microbe we can learn to slow the carbon molecule.
343,Journalist recounts the moment in the 2016 campaign where Trump took a ‘dark turn’,Cody Fenwick,Alternet,-2,https://www.alternet.org/2020/03/trump-economist-peter-navarro-fumbles-as-cnn-host-demands-answers-about-the-lack-of-ventilators/,In a new book excerpt published by Vanity Fair ABC reporter Jonathan Karl recounts a moment from December 2015 in which he began to believe Donald Trump’s presidential campaign started taking a “dark turn.”It was a few days before Christmas Karl recounted in “Front Row at the Trump Show” and the candidate was about to appear before thousands at a rally in Grand Rapids Michigan. A Trump aide had insisted in a profanity-laced demand that Karl’s upcoming TV interview with the candidate feature a prominent Christmas tree the book explained.But just a few minutes into the interview things went south. Karl says he brought up polls showing that Trump was consistently losing to Hillary Clinton — and he erroneously had missed a couple of polls showing her losing which Trump pointed out. In response Trump erupted.”If you are so sure that Hillary Clinton is going to beat me you shouldn’t be interviewing me because you are wasting your time” Trump reportedly said walking away from the interview. “Quote the polls where I win.”A little later before Trump went on stage before the crowd after he was away from the cameras he reportedly unleashed a tirade of profanity at the sight of Karl: “Fucking bullshit! Fucking nasty guy! That was fucking bullshit!”Karl continued:As I started to walk toward him Santucci jumped in front of me and said one word: “Don’t.” I noticed that as Trump continued to scream George Gigicos and campaign manager Corey Lewandowski were standing between us and Trump keeping him from coming back to me. Gigicos finally got Trump to turn and he walked through the black curtain and onto the stage to thunderous applause. And he wasn’t done yet. Onstage Trump went after me but he held back from calling me out by name. “You know I was just with somebody from ABC I won’t mention who” he told the crowd. “And he said ‘Oh the Hillary camp said they’d love to run against Trump.’ Of course they’re gonna say that…Ask Jeb Bush if he enjoys running against me. Seriously. Ask him.” I had asked much tougher questions of Trump in virtually every other interview I had done with him but any suggestion that he was or could be a loser enraged him. And although he was enraged he was also fully aware of the cameras. He didn’t rage until he was out of the room and out of their sight.Trump later joked about how he hates reporters but unlike Vladimir Putin he wouldn’t want to kill them. Eventually Trump came back for the rest of the interview Karl said and “was once again all smiles like nothing had happened.”“Trump had insulted and taunted reporters since the early days of his campaign but there in Grand Rapids the last rally before Christmas 2015 I sensed he was taking a dark turn” Karl wrote. “He was no longer complaining about unfair coverage or insulting individual reporters he was crafting a new role for the press in the Trump Show. We were the villains. His crowds loved the attacks on the press and he was about to give them more of what they wanted.”Now one could easily quarrel with Karl’s claim here. Trump’s campaign was already quite dark. He announced his candidacy with a vicious screed claiming Mexico of sending rapists to the United States and he built his political profile on the racist claim that President Barack Obama had faked his birth certificate. His fascist tendencies were long evident.But Trump’s targeting of the press has been a distinctive feature of both his candidacy and his presidency and it may be having its worst consequences now. Trump has convinced a wide segment of the public that he is a much more reliable source of information than the media; and now he has turned his disinformation campaign on to the subject of the coronavirus pandemic. Since he thinks it’s in his interest to downplay the seriousness of the threat the fact that so many people will tune out dissenting voices poses a major danger to the country.
344,GOP’s Matt Gaetz obliterated after going full ‘Florida Man’ with racist uninformed coronavirus tweet,Walter Einenkel,Alternet,-2,https://www.alternet.org/2020/03/gops-matt-gaetz-obliterated-after-going-full-florida-man-with-racist-uninformed-coronavirus-tweet/,There are all kinds of issues one might have with the coronavirus emergency relief bill. However one of those issues is obviously not going to be earmarking money to go to medical facilities that are dealing directly with COVID-19 cases. But that is exactly what Florida Man Matt Gaetz did on Wednesday when the congressman decided to try and score some racist dogwhistle points with fellow faux-fiscal conservatives. “Education is important- but a $13 million check to Howard does not belong in COVID-19 relief.” Attacking a prestigious HBCU is the kind of racism that bigots like Gaetz consider a salient point. Unfortunately for Mr. Florida Man intelligence facts and the use of those two things are not a strong suit of Rep. Gaetz.Steve Hofstetter is a comedian and comedy writer and his response to Rep. Gaetz took off almost instantly since it was so well-written.

345,Trump economist Peter Navarro fumbles as CNN host demands answers about the lack of ventilators,Sarah K. Burris,Alternet,-2,https://www.alternet.org/2020/03/trump-economist-peter-navarro-fumbles-as-cnn-host-demands-answers-about-the-lack-of-ventilators/,CNN’s Brianna Keilar lost it with President Donald Trump’s top economist Peter Navarro during an interview Thursday.The two were discussing the lack of protective equipment available for healthcare professionals on the front lines of fighting to save people suffering from the coronavirus. The president has said that he is leaving it up to governors to find their own masks and ventilators. New York has begged the federal government for some of their surplus supply while other companies ramp up efforts to produce more.Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D-NY) requested 30000 ventilators but he only got 4000. He told the federal government that they are going to have to give direction over who to choose to die.When faced with questions about the federal government being caught flat-footed Navarro bristled with defensiveness.“The Chinese Communist Party cost this country and the rest of the world six-weeks of preparation because they did not tell us early to mid-December that there was a crisis of human to human transmission with a new novel coronavirus” Navarro said. “That has set the world back six weeks so we are dealing with this issue every day. We have a full force of the federal government.”Cases of coronavirus didn’t surface until November 19 and the Chinese didn’t discover what it was significantly later. On December 31 China alerted the World Health Organization to several cases of an unusual type of pneumonia in Wuhan. At that point the virus was still unknown. They didn’t uncover it was a new strain of a virus until Jan. 7. The first case hit the United States on January 19. It took Trump 40 days from that point to declare a national emergency and begin taking action. Intelligence reports date back to January demanding action on coronavirus. Thursday marks day 67 since the first case hit the U.S.“In fairness the government was clearly ill-prepared for this” Keilar shot back. “This is not something that you know these viruses happen and how awful they are. But they are things that happen. Your government knew in the summer when they did a drill if this happens this would be a problem and there was a lack of preparation which was why we have you on to talk about the sly supply chain. The US it looks like is going to be about 200000 ventilators and what experts are saying there could be a million needed. Are you going to be able to meet that demand?”She also asked if the president understands that relaxing restrictions on April 12 means that the hospitals are going to need even more.Navarro turned to blame President Barack Obama’s administration and their reaction to H1N1.“Peter why are you wasting your time on this and not solving the problem you have? Peter why are you even talking about this?” Keilar asked.“You made the claim that this administration was ill-preparedv” Navarro said.“That’s a fact Peter. That’s a fact” she replied. “I’m just asking you if you’re going to be able to get to a million ventilators.”“Look if you’ll let me” Navarro tried to respond.As a fact check there were no tests for coronavirus in the stockpile because coronavirus didn’t exist until now. The White House was warned by the Obama administration and by Trump’s own staff in a 69-page report three years ago that they were not prepared if a pandemic hit the United States.“Are you going to have a million ventilators?” she asked again.“You keep talking in my ear and you won’t let me talk” Navarro whined.“Will you answer the question? Can you get to a million ventilators?” Keilar asked.“That wasn’t the question. You asked why this administration was ill-prepared” Navarro said before going off on a rant about not having enough resources. He called it a 500-year-flood when the US was only equipped to handle a 100-year-flood. “We’re doing the best we can but don’t tell me we were ill-prepared for this because we inherited a system of testing a system of stockpiles that was woefully inadequate.”
346,Mulvaney and other Trump confidant got tested even as the publicly downplayed coronavirus,Kerry Eleveld,Alternet,-2,https://www.alternet.org/2020/03/mulvaney-and-other-trump-confidant-got-tested-even-as-the-publicly-downplayed-coronavirus/,As critical shortages of coronavirus tests persist nationwide there’s one group of people who have no trouble getting testing access—Trump loyalists. Case in point: Mick Mulvaney who late last month told a gathering of conservative activists that the media was simply hyping the coronavirus pandemic to “bring down the president.”“It’s not a death sentence it’s not the same as the Ebola crisis” Mulvaney told attendees of the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) on February 28. What Mulvaney didn’t share with those activists was the fact that he had already been tested once for the coronavirus according to the Washington Post and at a time when access to testing in the U.S. was nearly nonexistent. Mulvaney still showing no symptoms then proceeded to get a follow-up test this month after a close contact with someone who spent time with members of a Brazilian delegation and later tested positive for the virus.In fact proximity to Trump has proven to be the surest way to jump the massive line of millions waiting for coronavirus testing. While governors continue to clamor for more tests and faster turnaround on results and most testing continues to be limited to the most critical cases and front-line health care workers Mulvaney is one of three Trump confidants to get tested even though they weren’t experiencing any of the symptoms commonly associated with COVID-19.The other two members of Trump’s inner circle to undergo asymptomatic testing were Trump’s incoming chief of staff Mark Meadows and consummate Florida man Rep. Matt Gaetz who earlier this month mocked concerns about the disease by donning a gas mask on the floor of the House.And yet another asymptomatic Trump booster who hopped the testing line is GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky who not only tested positive but also declined to self-quarantine during the six-day window in which he awaited his results putting everyone who came into contact with him at risk.
347,‘Me’ not ‘we’: Here’s how far-right arguments against social distancing mimic those against Obamacare,Alex Henderson,Alternet,-2,https://www.alternet.org/2020/03/me-not-we-heres-how-far-right-arguments-against-social-distancing-mimic-those-against-obamacare/,Far-right talk show host Glenn Beck is being slammed by everyone from liberals and progressives to Never Trump conservatives for his idiotic argument that if older Americans have to die from coronavirus so be it — it’s better to end social distancing and get the U.S. economy back on track than to maintain social distancing and keep hurting the economy. Beck’s argument was not only morally bankrupt but also unscientific: coronavirus can kill younger Americans as well. Beck however is not alone in making such assertions and journalist Ronald Brownstein — in an article for The Atlantic — notes the parallels between far-right arguments against social distancing in 2020 and far-right arguments made against the Affordable Care Act of 2010 a.k.a. Obamacare in the past.“How much do the healthiest people in society owe to the most vulnerable?” Brownstein writes in his article. “That question — about Americans’ capacity for shared sacrifice — was at the core of the struggle over repealing the Affordable Care Act during the first months of Donald Trump’s presidency. Now it’s resurfacing in the escalating partisan debate over responding to the coronavirus crisis.”Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick a Republican has made arguments against social distancing that are similar to Beck’s. In Patrick’s view it’s wrong to tell younger Americans to refrain from working in order to protect older Americans from coronavirus — which is a ridiculous argument because even though coronavirus has killed thousands of older people around the world it hasn’t signed an affidavit promising not to kill anyone under 50. People in their twenties and thirties have died from COVID-19 as well and they can still become infected if they come into contact with those who have already been infected.As Brownstein points out one of the Republican arguments against Obamacare was that healthier Americans shouldn’t have to subsidize Americans with major health problems.“Promoting the sharing of risk between the healthy and the sick was a preeminent goal of the ACA” Brownstein notes. “Before the law people with significant health needs were either charged much higher premiums for coverage in the individual-insurance market or denied coverage altogether because they had a preexisting condition. Those rules benefited healthier people buying individual coverage: because those with greater needs were systematically excluded insurers had to pay out fewer claims — allowing them to hold down premiums for everyone else.”According to Sabrina Corlette a researcher at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University in Washington D.C.  there is clearly a parallel between arguments against mandatory social distancing and arguments against Obamacare.“It absolutely is a parallel there” Corlette told The Atlantic. “It’s very much about the social compact and how much cost do I have to incur to help my neighbor who may be in greater need than I am?”One of the strongest arguments in favor of universal health care has to do with communicable diseases: when the poor or the uninsured don’t receive the health care they need they are more likely to pass diseases along to others. In other words an uninsured American who has pneumonia is problematic for Americans in general — including those with health insurance — whether Republicans like it or not. But Republicans as Brownstein observes live in a world of “me” rather than “we” and reject the assertion that someone else’s wellbeing can affect their own wellbeing.“It’s not too surprising to see Trump and other Republicans bridle against social distancing” Brownstein writes. “Their complaints fit with the right’s long-standing unease about any policy that shares risk by imposing costs broadly.”
348,Journalist recounts the moment in the 2016 campaign where Trump took a ‘dark turn’,Cody Fenwick,Alternet,-2,https://www.alternet.org/2020/03/journalist-recounts-the-moment-in-the-2016-campaign-where-trump-took-a-dark-turn/,In a new book excerpt published by Vanity Fair ABC reporter Jonathan Karl recounts a moment from December 2015 in which he began to believe Donald Trump’s presidential campaign started taking a “dark turn.”It was a few days before Christmas Karl recounted in “Front Row at the Trump Show” and the candidate was about to appear before thousands at a rally in Grand Rapids Michigan. A Trump aide had insisted in a profanity-laced demand that Karl’s upcoming TV interview with the candidate feature a prominent Christmas tree the book explained.  But just a few minutes into the interview things went south. Karl says he brought up polls showing that Trump was consistently losing to Hillary Clinton — and he erroneously had missed a couple of polls showing her losing which Trump pointed out. In response Trump erupted.”If you are so sure that Hillary Clinton is going to beat me you shouldn’t be interviewing me because you are wasting your time” Trump reportedly said walking away from the interview. “Quote the polls where I win.”A little later before Trump went on stage before the crowd after he was away from the cameras he reportedly unleashed a tirade of profanity at the sight of Karl: “Fucking bullshit! Fucking nasty guy! That was fucking bullshit!”     Karl continued:As I started to walk toward him Santucci jumped in front of me and said one word: “Don’t.” I noticed that as Trump continued to scream George Gigicos and campaign manager Corey Lewandowski were standing between us and Trump keeping him from coming back to me. Gigicos finally got Trump to turn and he walked through the black curtain and onto the stage to thunderous applause. And he wasn’t done yet. Onstage Trump went after me but he held back from calling me out by name. “You know I was just with somebody from ABC I won’t mention who” he told the crowd. “And he said ‘Oh the Hillary camp said they’d love to run against Trump.’ Of course they’re gonna say that…Ask Jeb Bush if he enjoys running against me. Seriously. Ask him.” I had asked much tougher questions of Trump in virtually every other interview I had done with him but any suggestion that he was or could be a loser enraged him. And although he was enraged he was also fully aware of the cameras. He didn’t rage until he was out of the room and out of their sight.Trump later joked about how he hates reporters but unlike Vladimir Putin he wouldn’t want to kill them. Eventually Trump came back for the rest of the interview Karl said and “was once again all smiles like nothing had happened.”“Trump had insulted and taunted reporters since the early days of his campaign but there in Grand Rapids the last rally before Christmas 2015 I sensed he was taking a dark turn” Karl wrote. “He was no longer complaining about unfair coverage or insulting individual reporters he was crafting a new role for the press in the Trump Show. We were the villains. His crowds loved the attacks on the press and he was about to give them more of what they wanted.”Now one could easily quarrel with Karl’s claim here. Trump’s campaign was already quite dark. He announced his candidacy with a vicious screed claiming Mexico of sending rapists to the United States and he built his political profile on the racist claim that President Barack Obama had faked his birth certificate. His fascist tendencies were long evident.But Trump’s targeting of the press has been a distinctive feature of both his candidacy and his presidency and it may be having its worst consequences now. Trump has convinced a wide segment of the public that he is a much more reliable source of information than the media; and now he has turned his disinformation campaign on to the subject of the coronavirus pandemic. Since he thinks it’s in his interest to downplay the seriousness of the threat the fact that so many people will tune out dissenting voices poses a major danger to the country.
349,Trump tells governors he’s working on new Covid-19 guidelines for social distancing measures,Cody Fenwick,Alternet,-2,https://www.alternet.org/2020/03/trump-tells-governors-hes-working-on-new-covid-19-guidelines-for-social-distancing-measures/,President Donald Trump sent a letter to U.S. governors on Thursday telling them that the administration is developing new guidelines for state and local leaders to respond to the coronavirus.“There is still a long battle ahead but our efforts are already paying dividends” it said.The letter took a strikingly different tone than Trump’s public comments in which the president has lambasted the media for trying to use social distancing practices to take him down. This week he announced that he would like to see the country roll back social distancing measures by Easter — April 12 — when we could see “packed churches” across the country. Public health experts however have almost uniformly said this plan is far too optimistic. Packing churches full of people while the coronavirus is still spreading rapidly throughout the population could be cataclysmic.In his letter Trump didn’t mention Easter but he indicated that the administration will “publish new guidelines for State and local policymakers to use in making decisions about maintaining increasing or relaxing social distancing and other mitigation measures they have put in place.”It continued: “Our expanded testing capabilities will quickly enable us to publish criteria developed in close coordination with the Nation’s public health officials and scientists to help classify counties with respect to continued risks posed by the virus. This will incorporate robust surveillance testing which allows us to monitor the spread of the virus throughout the country. Under these data-driven criteria we will suggest guidelines categorizing counties as high-risk medium-risk or low-risk.”It’s not really clear how helpful these different risk-level designations will be since people can travel easily across county lines.The letter also expressed more concern for the people affected by the virus than is common in Trump’s public appearances: “The virus has inflicted a heavy toll on our country. A number of our fellow citizens have tragically succumbed to its ravages while many more are fighting for their lives.”At other times Trump has downplayed the fatality risk from Covid-19 by comparing it to the mortality rate of the flu or automobile accidents (though the total death count from the coronavirus is expected to surpass both potentially many times over). And he has now repeatedly said that the “cure is worse than the problem” — indicating that he’s less concerned about the cost of the coronavirus compared to the economic costs of widespread shutdowns.The letter represents an effort by the White House to frame Trump’s new push to “reopen the country” in a way that seems more sensible and science-based. But he remains in charge — and his reckless messaging will continue — so this may be a sign that more reasonable voices in the administration are actually losing influence.The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman noted in response to the letter: “Some in White House share POTUS view that there has to be an end date that people can look toward when life might resume. But division over whether April 12 [Easter] is overly optimistic.”It is likely too soon to begin talking about relaxing social distancing measures at all. Obviously that will need to come eventually but there’s no sign yet that the spread of the virus has even begun to slow down. Social distancing is hard and sending signals that make people think it may not be so important can reduce compliance and put many more lives at risk.It’s not really clear how helpful these different risk-level designations will be since people can travel easily across county lines.The letter also expressed more concern for the people affected by the virus than is common in Trump’s public appearances: “The virus has inflicted a heavy toll on our country.

350,‘Beyond parody’: Fox News host blasted for saying ‘people are dying’ — but my friends ‘can’t get their nails done’,Daily Kos,Alternet,-2,https://www.alternet.org/2020/03/beyond-parody-fox-news-host-blasted-for-saying-people-are-dying-but-my-friends-cant-get-their-nails-done/,Thursday’s “Fox & Friends” featured insight into how the rich on the right a struggling to deal with the coronavirus pandemic that has killed over 1000 people in the U.S. where there are more than 68000 confirmed cases. A record 3.3 million people filed for unemployment this past week.“I live in the city” Ainsley Earhardt told her co-hosts. “You can’t go back to the city – you can but I don’t want to I don’t want to be around the area that’s infected the most” she said. The New York City region is now the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S.“But I’m thinking like all the bills that are stacking up at my apartment. You know we’ve got to think about that kind of thing. If you bought clothing before all this happened and you want to return it are stores going to you know waive that 30 day period where you can get your money back if you need to return something?”“These are all the things. Women – y’all don’t think about this guys but – this is not a priority but women have to get their hair done. I saw someone tweet out ‘You’re gonna see what color our real hair is because our roots are going to grow in.’ Women – all my friends are saying this is not a priority people are dying and I realize that – but they can’t get their nails done.”“You know businesses are closed everywhere. We’re in priority mode right now. It’s pharmacies and it is grocery stores – those are really the only places that people are going now.”
351,Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic is that of a ‘weakman authoritarian’ — not a full-fledged ‘autocrat’: Politico founder,Alex Henderson,Alternet,-2,https://www.alternet.org/2020/03/trumps-response-to-the-coronavirus-pandemic-is-that-of-a-weakman-authoritarian-not-a-full-fledged-autocrat-politico-founder/,Critics of President Donald Trump have often used the word “authoritarian” to attack him noting the admiration that Trump has expressed for bullies like the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro Turkey’sRecep Tayyip Erdoğan and Russia’s Vladimir Putin. But Politico co-founder John F. Harris in a thought-provoking article published on March 26 argues that Trump’s response to the coronavirus pandemic is that of a “weakman authoritarian” — not a true strongman or a “autocrat.”Harris doesn’t deny that Trump has authoritarian instincts but he essentially argues that the U.S. president lacks the self-discipline of a true “autocrat.” And such an autocrat according to Harris would have used the pandemic as an excuse to exert as much control as possible.  “The notion of Trump as authoritarian strongman” Harris contends “has been cast in an odd light in this pandemic. Would-be tyrants use crisis to consolidate power. Trump by contrast has been pilloried from many quarters including many liberals for not asserting authority and responsibility more forcefully to combat COVID-19. Rather than seizing on a genuine emergency Trump was slow to issue an emergency declaration moved gingerly in employing the War Production Act to help overburdened local health systems and even now seems eager to emphasize that many subjects — closure of schools and businesses obtaining sufficient ventilators — are primarily problems for state governors to deal with.”According to Harris there are two main “pillars” of “anti-Trump” thought coming from his “most ardent detractors”: the first pillar is that he is “a terrible person whose terribleness finds expression in terrible policies” while the “second pillar” is that Trump is “a leader bent on amassing personal power and undermining constitutional democracy.” And during the coronavirus pandemic Harris writes one could make an argument for the “first pillar” much more easily than for the second. But in “recent weeks according to Harris  the “second pillar” has “wobbled.”“Perhaps the way to think of Trump is as an authoritarian weakman” Harris writes. And he points to Trump’s “I don’t take any responsibility at all” assertion in reference to coronavirus’ spread in the U.S. as an example of someone who doesn’t have what it takes to be a full-fledged strongman. Another recent Trump quote that Harris cites is “The governors locally are going to be in command. We will be following them and we hope they can do the job.”“Quotes like these don’t mean the critique of Trump as aspiring dictator is in terminal condition” Harris asserts. “But it is on bed rest with a high fever.”“Even a Trump defender could comprehend how Trump critics would seize on the performance of the past two months — ‘we have it totally under control’ he said on January 22 — to add damaging new counts to the indictment they began compiling four years ago” Harris observes.
352,‘Foreclosure king’ Steve Mnuchin claims never-before-seen surge in unemployment ‘not relevant’,Jake Johnson,Alternet,-2,https://www.alternet.org/2020/03/foreclosure-king-steve-mnuchin-claims-never-before-seen-surge-in-unemployment-not-relevant/,Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin the former Goldman Sachs banker Congress is about to entrust with overseeing a $4.5 trillion corporate bailout fund said Thursday that the record-shattering surge in jobless claims last week due to the coronavirus crisis is “not relevant” to the health of the economy and insisted that businesses will soon be able to “hire back those people.”“To be honest with you I just think these numbers right now are not relevant” said Mnuchin showing what critics denounced as a callous lack of regard for the economic pain of millions of people.“They’re going to give nearly unchecked power to dole out trillions of dollars to a guy who just called over 3 million new unemployment claims ‘not relevant'” tweeted progressive talk show host John Iadarola.In response to Mnuchin’s remarks Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) tweeted that the staggering new unemployment figures “are in fact extremely relevant.”“Millions of people lost their livelihoods” said Pocan. “Which also means millions lost their health insurance.”“Maybe not the right guy to oversee COVID-19 crisis response” Allied Progress tweeted. As HuffPost‘s Amanda Terkel and Zach Carter wrote Thursday Mnuchin’s claim that businesses will soon be able to rehire the millions of workers who filed for unemployment last week “is wishful thinking to put it mildly.”“Despite its big price tag economists believe the legislation passed by the Senate on Wednesday is far too modest to meet the scope of the coming economic crash” wrote Terkel and Carter. “The $349 billion the legislation sets aside for small businesses will be exhausted quickly but experts also believe that it will take months for the aid to reach most small firms. During that time many of them will simply fail and you can’t rehire workers if you don’t have a company.”Report AdvertisementReport AdvertisementConsumer advocacy group Allied Progress said the comments are “not surprising coming from Steve Mnuchin the ‘Foreclosure King’ of the last recession” referring to the nickname progressives gave Mnuchin after his destructive tenure as CEO of OneWest Bank.Mnuchin said he hopes “those workers will be rehired” and pointed to temporary protections for the unemployed in the stimulus legislation that passed the Senate Wednesday night.Asked about the news Thursday that 3.3 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week Mnuchin said in an appearance on CNBC that President Donald Trump is “protecting those people.”
353,Trump is a dangerous media mastermind,Julian Zelizer,CNN Opinion,-2,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/21/opinions/trump-racist-tweet-mastery-media-coverage-zelizer/index.html,"The media have spent several days covering the noxious chant -- ""Send them back"" -- that broke out at President Donald Trump's North Carolina rally. The chant was inspired by a tweet from the President saying that congresswomen Ilhan Omar Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Ayanna Pressley and Rahida Tlaib should ""go back"" to the ""broken and crime infested places from which they came."" Critics rightly condemned the President for encouraging this racist message among his loyal base. No longer shy about calling out Trump's use of racist tropes politicians and reporters came down hard on his injection of dangerous rhetoric into his reelection campaign. And though Trump later said he didn't like the chant he did nothing to stop it.Trump is trying to repeat historyBut here's the problem: This kind of nonstop coverage is exactly what the President counts on. Since Trump declared his candidacy so many reporters have endeavored to call out the President when he lies or distorts the facts. And though they've been more discerning in trying to sift the serious stories from the daily chaos they still have not figured out how to handle the ways he manipulates the 24-hour news cycle to promote political messages meant to provoke and incite. Regardless of how news stories evaluate what the President or his supporters have said the message itself keeps circulating in the public square. From his tweet to the subsequent chants to the endless coverage about the rally voters in Trump country are hearing ""send them back"" over and over again wording with a long history in racist and nativist discourse and one now targeting four prominent women of color. Although analysts are disputing what impact his white nationalism will have in the election writers like Nate Cohn and David Wasserman have argued that these messages might strengthen the advantages that he has in the Electoral College. Send her back' will be the Trump era's defining sloganEver since the start of the television age politicians have understood that the news coverage of controversial messages can do more than anything to advance a single cause. In 1964 President Lyndon Johnson's campaign team released a television spot suggesting that his opponent Republican Sen. Barry Goldwater would trigger a nuclear war. The ""Daisy"" ad depicted a young girl counting the petals on a flower before viewers heard a government voice counting down in more ominous fashion. The ad concludes with the image of a nuclear mushroom cloud. Republicans were furious. Illinois Senator Everett Dirksen a Republican who was pivotal to helping Johnson pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 denounced the ad for taking ""political advertising to a depth never approached in the history of television."" The Johnson team pulled the ad but the mission was complete. And according to political journalist Theodore White ""the shriek of Republican indignation fastened the bomb message on [Goldwater's campaign] more tightly than any calculation could have expected."" The news coverage of the ad further promoted the message that Johnson's team wanted to promote: Goldwater could not be trusted with the nation's political arsenal. The Squad is a gift to TrumpThis tactic has been used many times since by candidates as well as interest groups. During the debate over President Bill Clinton's health care plan in 1993 and 1994 the Health Insurance Industry of America released a blistering ad that featured a white suburban couple Harry and Louise worrying about what the plan would do to their health care coverage. Louise looking at a copy of the proposal tells her husband that ""this plan forces us to buy our insurance through these new mandatory government health alliances."" Sharing the concern Harry adds that it would be ""run by tens of thousands of new bureaucrats."" The ad ran in only a handful of major markets. But the small insurance lobby understood how ""Daisy"" had worked. The media coverage of the ad spread the message to even larger markets and made it a national story. Chip Kahn one of the masterminds of the ads loved when Clinton attacked them. ""Every time we did a new ad ... we were on the evening news"" he recalled. Trump similarly relies on this dynamic. However unlike in 1964 and even 1994 he can now depend on two additional factors. The first is his Twitter feed which enables him to get his message to millions of people in a matter of seconds. The second is a 24-hour political news platform which often will endlessly cover any message he tweets into the universe. The combination of cable news online publications and his incredibly powerful Twitter feed means that any statement he makes will be subject to ongoing discussion for many days to come. And the more controversial the greater the coverage. The President's mastery of the modern media environment should not be underestimated. As the campaign season gets underway editors reporters and producers will have to decide how much of their resources they allocate to covering discussing and analyzing Trump's latest incendiary message. His opponents will also have to be more discerning about responding and reacting so much concentrating instead on building their own agendas and promoting their own issues. The best way to drown out messages -- such as the one we saw this past week -- is to avoid giving the message more air time than it deserves. And while it's important to call out racism it's equally vital to cover the many policies this administration is proposing and implementing on a day-to-day basis."
354,What to expect from Mueller's testimony,Shanlon Wu,CNN Opinion,-2,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/20/opinions/mueller-testimony-wu/index.html,"What can we expect July 24 when Robert Mueller the former special counsel testifies in back-to-back hearings before the House Judiciary and House Intelligence Committees?We can expect the testimony that Attorney General William Barr should have given. In short Mueller will act and testify with all the dignity and integrity lacking in the current attorney general. Mueller will be factual dispassionate and most of all accurate in his testimony.Shanlon WuThere will be no partisan spin. While we will not hear Mueller express sympathy for President Donald Trump's feelings (or anyone else's feelings) neither will we hear him express moral outrage over Trump's actions. Mueller will also defend to the death his right not to speculate by reciting -- mantra-like -- his belief that his testimony must be limited to the four corners of his 400-page report.Therefore Democratic members of Congress who view Mueller's testimony as an opportunity to conclusively show Trump's guilt will be disappointed as much as those Republican members who think Mueller's testimony will fully exonerate Trump. In truth his testimony represents a historically unique opportunity to demonstrate for the American people how a republic can properly function as well as show those who support the move how to muster the necessary political will to commence an impeachment inquiry. To accomplish this the Democratic members must understand the difference between questions asked in direct examination and questions asked in cross-examination. The former will work wonders with Mueller while the latter are doomed to failure.The basic distinction between direct examination questions and cross-examination questions is that direct examination questions consist of who what where when and why. They seek explanation. On the other hand cross-examination questions start with assumptions (""isn't it true that ..."") and therefore seek agreement.Mueller is a former prosecutor and prosecutors are most familiar with direct examination questions because that's what they base their cases on and how they meet their burden of proof. He will not like cross-exam questions meant to get him to agree with some assertion.Republican members foolish enough to ask Mueller the question ""Isn't it true that your report fully exonerated the President?"" will get absolutely nowhere. Similarly Democratic members asking questions such as ""Isn't it true that you found evidence that the President obstructed justice?"" will find themselves frustrated by Mueller's reticence and squander their chances.Democrats can elicit everything they need from Mueller in only three direct examination questions accompanied by follow-up. The three questions are:1. Explain your view of whether a sitting President of the United States can be indicted.2. Explain why you could not say that the President did not commit a crime.3. Explain the difference between finding evidence of Trump and his associates having contacts with Russia and finding sufficient evidence to charge the President with crimes.These three questions are quite straightforward but it will be the quality of the follow-up questions that determine whether they yield gold. Here is the key to asking high-yield follow-up questions of Mueller: Seek further explanations not agreement with assumptions. For example a good follow-up question would be ""Why did you investigate the circumstances of the Trump Tower meeting?' and ""Why were those circumstances significant to your investigation?""Robert Mueller's disciplined silence and taciturn demeanor render him a kind of tabula rasa upon which people project their views of the Trump presidency. For his upcoming testimony to be more than a reflection of warring passions the questioners must be wiser and greater than their politics."
355,The God of Love had a really bad week,Diana Butler Bass,CNN Opinion,-2,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/20/opinions/god-of-love-had-a-really-bad-week-bass/index.html,"Shock is not the right word when I heard the crowd at a Trump rally chanting ""send her back."" There has been so much shock recently that it is hard to know what to call it anymore.As the crowd continued to chant I watched them: They were almost exclusively white wearing T-shirts and polos with blonde hair peeking from under MAGA hats. Familiar-looking middle class white people -- like my neighbors classmates friends and family. I assumed most were probably Christians. Trump's ""base."" ""Where"" I blurted out to my husband ""did these people go to Sunday school?"" He stared. ""You are worried about Sunday school?""""Yes. Sunday school"" I insisted. ""That song -- the one we all learned. Jesus loves everybody."" I quoted what may well be the Protestant Sunday school national anthem:   esus loves the little childrenAll the children of the worldRed brown yellowBlack and whiteThey are precious in His sightJesus loves the little childrenOf the worldI sang it in Methodist kindergarten the teacher displaying a picture of children of every color holding hands. ""Jesus said we are all equal"" she instructed ""God loves everybody and you should too."" It would take me awhile to figure out that the Declaration of Independence was not in the Bible but it sounded right at the time. As the chant died down the rhetoric of division went on with new words from the President's speech. That familiar audience -- mostly white probably mostly Christian -- continued to howl its approval. As many have noted ""send her back"" is racist sexist and un-American. It is also the expression of a certain view of God one that has slowly shifted the priorities and teaching in far too many American churches and made it possible for those who would have once sung Jesus Loves the Little Children to join this hostile liturgy. How did they get there? Slowly perhaps imperceptibly hymn-by-hymn and sermon-by-sermon one theological step at a time.I do not feel shock. I feel grief. I do not recognize this Christianity even if the faces in the crowd were familiar.Not all Christians support Donald Trump. The president remains wildly unpopular among Christians who are persons of color. A majority of white Christians continue to approve of him. Of white Christians according to Pew evangelical support for Trump hovers around 70%; white mainline Christians are split with 48% approval; and around 44% of white Roman Catholics support him.These numbers demonstrate the strength of white Christian base but they also suggest something else: America's white churches are roiled by political division. Although pro-Trump evangelicals are a solid majority the divides in other white Christian groups are fairly even. Many white Christians are struggling with fractured families and frayed friendships. White clergy friends have reported to me that angry congregants have intimidated them after preaching a political sermon with threats to rescind donations or to have them fired. A recurring feature of progressive Christian Twitter has become white people bemoaning the fact that their relatives and friends have turned away from Jesus' command to love one's neighbor. White Christianity right now is a dumpster of discord; internecine warfare has not been this bad since the 1920s when controversy ripped American churches apart on whether human beings evolved from monkeys. In the last three years Donald Trump has replaced Charles Darwin as troublemaker-in-chief in many white American churches. Scholars have offered sound theories as to the cause of this sharp divide especially around issues of race and gender. There are excellent books on how white supremacy shaped American Christianity; and equally solid work regarding misogyny in churches particularly around abortion politics. The media publishes stories about Christian Democrats pushing back against Trump with liberal renderings of faith and politics. All are helpful. But none seems to get to the heart of the matter: Too many white Christians have a God problem.I recently mentioned to someone that my brother had not spoken to me since Charlottesville when we argued about white nationalism and racism. My friend asked ""How is that possible? That you and your brother could be so different?"" My brother and I grew up in the same Methodist Sunday school. We were confirmed together in the same Methodist church. Same parents same school same church. We sang how Jesus loved all children. We learned Golden Rule -- ""Do unto others"" -- and the Great Commandment -- ""Love God and love your neighbor."" Ours was not a scary God threatening sinners with hell. It was the God of the peaceable kingdom.My brother as an adult traded that God for a tougher stricter one who exercises judgment against all who refuse to bend the knee a kind of Emperor-God enthroned in glory. This God has often shown up in Christian history; including in American fundamentalism. But from 1980 onward he underwent a revival in several strands of American religion including Pentecostalism neo-Calvinism traditionalist Roman Catholicism and some Orthodox communities. He is a masculine Sovereign and a winner-God for people feeling displaced in a pluralistic world. And after 9/11 this militaristic God became more real.Meanwhile the God of Love was not having a particularly good run. In the political age bookended by Ronald Reagan's culture wars and a devastating terrorist attack the God of Love began to look like a loser one fit for liberation theologians do-gooders and feminists. The churches that still preached a God of Love declined; those seminaries closed.In 1865 Abraham Lincoln ruminated on how Americans had read the same Bible and prayed to the same God. Poetry aside Lincoln was wrong. My brother and I read the same Bible and wound up praying to different gods. His God thunders about lawless mobs and unbelievers. Mine is the mysterious Word present before the beginning of creation calling all to compassion and who welcomes little ones.This was true in Lincoln's day as well. In the 1840s and 1850s major denominations split over the issue of slavery and a deeper political crisis bound up with different visions of God: the God of the Master versus the God of Love. All theologies might come from the same Bible but they were not then and are not now equally true. Even as trends point to the decline of religion Americans are still living with this theological argument -- one playing out among Christians of mostly European descent. This argument shapes our politics its dogma chanted as liturgy in Trump rallies and offered up in pulpits across the land. This is an ancient conflict that never quite seems to go away. For whatever reason western Christianity has a hard time sticking with a God of love.But as a minority of white Christians know and the majority of Christians of color never need be reminded the God of love is always hanging around the brown-skinned Jewish rabbi preaching about the poor being blessed and the broken-hearted comforted. Love your neighbor as yourself. Do unto others. Let the little children come. Faith hope and love. And the greatest of these is love."
356,The 500-year battle over 'who is American' continues,Ben Railton,CNN Opinion,-2,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/20/opinions/who-is-american-500-year-battle-continues-railton/index.html,"Donald Trump's attack on four freshman Democratic congresswomen fits into a long tradition of people in power trying to define who is a real American—and an equally long tradition of resistance from those whom the powerful are trying to define out of the country.In his initial July 14th Twitter thread Trump wrote that the congresswomen ""come from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe"" and then suggested that they ""go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came."" Yet three of the four Congresswomen in question—Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib—were born in the United States; only one Ilhan Omar was born in another country (Somalia) and arrived in the United States with her family nearly three decades ago at the age of 10.While it's tempting to see this error as just another presidential misstatement or falsehood I would argue instead that Trump's description of these four women and their distinct cultural and ethnic heritages—Puerto Rican African-American Palestinian and Somali respectively—as all equally ""coming from"" outside of the United States is entirely purposeful and indeed comprises a core element of his and his supporters' exclusionary vision of American identity. Trump's racist 'go back' message is un-American demoralizing and unlawfulAs divisive and racist as the ""send her back"" gambit -- aimed at Rep. Omar and chanted fervently by Trump supporters at a recent rally -- is Trump's use of it is far from unprecedented; it has a long and turbulent history that has helped shape our nation. In earlier moments in that history as now the movement to exclude has been met with or intertwined with efforts to promulgate an inclusive vision of this country.My book reveals that such exclusionary definitions of America are but one side of a foundational and ongoing debate in the United States. These exclusionary visions define the American ""we"" by identifying numerous ""thems"" -- communities and cultures that are physically present in the United States but are not part of what this perspective sees as American identity. On the other side of this debate are definitions of the American ""we"" that see all those communities and cultures as instead integral parts of American identity. What is most striking about the battle between these competing definitions of America is how consistently we find examples of both at work during multiple consequential moments in our history. Here are four of those key moments:The documentation of America's Revolutionary idealsIn his draft of the Declaration of Independence Thomas Jefferson made slavery one of the colonists' complaints against King George calling enslaved Africans a ""distant people"" who had been ""obtruded upon"" the colonies and defining their desire for freedom as antithetical to the Revolution. But two enslaved African-Americans Elizabeth Freeman and Quock Walker embodied the Revolution's ideals by using the language of the Declaration and its legal extension in the 1780 Massachusetts Constitution to gain their freedom and facilitate the state's abolition of slavery. The Massachusetts Constitution's Article I begins ""All men are born free and equal"" and when Freeman an enslaved person in Sheffield heard the Constitution read aloud she approached an abolitionist local lawyer arguing ""I'm not a dumb critter; won't the law give me my freedom?"" In a 1783 Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling Chief Justice William Cushing agreed writing ""I think the idea of slavery is inconsistent with our own conduct and Constitution."" The status of Mexican Americans after 1848Although the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo promised US citizenship for Mexicans who remained in the newly acquired territories for much of the next century Anglo squatters white supremacist mobs and their governmental and military supporters forced many Mexican-Americans off their land and out of their communities. But Southern California rancher and author Maria Amparo Ruiz de Burton fought back against this forced expulsion through both legal and literary means as illustrated by both her successful lawsuit to win back her family ranch and her historical novel ""The Squatter and the Don"" (1885).When Ruiz de Burton returned to her San Diego ranch after her husband's death from Civil War wounds she found that Anglo squatters had occupied the land; she spent the next decade fighting to reclaim the land securing a federal land patent in October 1876. She then turned to literary activism as illustrated by chapter two of ""Squatter"" ""The Don's View of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo"" in which her main character expresses a Mexican-American take on these exclusionary histories and their effects. The treatment of Japanese Americans as ""alien enemies"" during World War IIExecutive Order 9066 the Roosevelt administration's February 1942 order of internment of hundreds of thousands of Japanese Americans depended entirely on definitions of that community (many of them US citizens) as threatening ""alien enemies"" for whose ""conduct and control"" the Executive Order was created. But Hawaii's Varsity Victory Volunteers a group of Japanese-American college students refused to be forced out of the military in the months after Pearl Harbor writing to the territorial governor ""We know but one loyalty and that is to the Stars and Stripes. We wish to do our part as loyal Americans in every way possible."" Inspired in part by their example over the next three years more than 30000 Japanese American men volunteered for the armed forces with more than 2000 coming from the internment camps. Their 442nd Regimental Combat Team became by the war's end the most decorated unit in American military history and at a July 1946 ceremony in which he awarded them a Presidential Distinguished Unit Citation President Truman remarked ""You fought the enemy abroad and prejudice at home and you won.""The dehumanization of Muslim Americans after 9/11 and beyondTwenty-first century exclusions have frequently targeted Muslim-Americans culminating in our current moment of Muslim bans hate crimes and political debates over whether ""Sharia Law"" prohibits Muslim-Americans from holding elected office at all. Yet Muslim-Americans have been present and influential at every stage of American history as exemplified by the Revolutionary era Charleston (SC) Moroccan American community. In January 1790 eight members of that community petitioned the South Carolina House of Representatives arguing that as free-born subjects of a nation with which the US had a treaty (Morocco was the first nation to recognize the United States) they were entitled to citizenship.                        The Moors Sundry Act of 1790 granted their petition and gave these Moroccan-Americans citizenship but they had an even more striking influence on early American law: Charleston's own Charles Pinckney a cousin to the judge who first supported the Moroccan-American petition was the framer who drafted the Constitution's Article VI guarantee that ""no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States""; and in defending that clause during the ratification debates the Constitution's advocates noted ""It is objected that ... pagans and Mahometans may be admitted into offices. But how is it possible to exclude any set of men without taking away that principle of religious freedom which we ourselves so warmly contend for?"" Perhaps the two most common threads across all these histories that is are exclusionary policies and oppressions challenged and countered by inclusive American lives and communities. Those contemporary lessons drawn from these episodes of the past are both bracing and vital. As the last few days have illustrated with particular clarity we find ourselves in the midst of another profoundly exclusionary moment with not only laws and policies but the words and perspectives emanating from our federal government offering these white supremacist visions of America. Yet once again inspiring American figures and communities offer inclusive alternatives visions of an America that resist and transcend those exclusions. The four congresswomen targeted by Trump and indeed their entire cohort of 2018 elected officials embody that inclusive American identity and perspective."
357,Women in Puerto Rico know all too well why Rossello must resign,Sandra Guzman,CNN Opinion,-2,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/20/opinions/women-in-puerto-rico-know-why-rossello-must-resign-guzman/index.html,"Puerto Rican women warned us. They have been alerting us for years that there is a crisis of violence against women on the island. After Hurricane Maria the crisis became an emergency. Nonprofits that provide services to survivors of domestic violence reported a surge in requests for help. Despite the outcry from women little to nothing was done at the highest levels of government. And now Governor Ricardo Rossello's leaked chats -- nearly 900 pages in all published by Puerto Rico's Center for Investigative Journalism — show him the governor of this country where women are living in crisis calling women whores and encouraging violence against women elected officials. This is the tipping point for many islanders but especially for the women. Now many women say they understand why their calls have been ignored: the macho culture of Rosello and his boys. Two male members of Rossello's Cabinet who also participated in the chats have resigned in the wake of the scandal but the governor -- who has apologized for some of his comments saying they were a way to blow off steam after a day's hard work -- said he will remain. Women on the island are furious. We all should be. This is a crisis that has been allowed to fester at the expense of the lives of women and children. Rossello must resign. According to an ACLU report Puerto Rico has the highest per capita rate in the world of women over 14 killed by their partners a number the organization describes as disturbing and climbing. Researchers found that governmental agencies fail to follow protocols respond record and investigate crimes of rape and sexual assault. And of the 20000 domestic violence cases reported to police annually the ACLU report citing a government office found that only a fraction 500 result in conviction. They have been ignored.""Just yesterday two more women were killed and one of them an 18-year-old was pregnant"" Vilma Gonzalez told me over the phone on Wednesday. Gonzalez a mother of a 24-year-old daughter was on her way to the march in San Juan to join hundreds of thousands who are calling on the governor to step down. She is the executive director of Paz Para la Mujer (Peace for Women) a 30-year-old organization that helps victims of domestic violence and has worked for the organization for 17 years.""He and his administration don't take women seriously they think we are all whores. He must step down"" she said.The governor's private chats were homophobic and crass — he made fun of obese people poverty-shamed a neighbor whose shack was destroyed by the hurricane. He also made fun of the dead. And Rossello showed his disturbing misogyny. In one exchange Rossello's chief fiscal officer says he is ""salivating to shoot"" San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz and Rossello's response was: ""You'd be doing me a grand favor."" In another Rossello calls former Speaker of New York City Council Melissa Mark-Viverito a whore who should be beaten up. Words are a window into a mindset and also into an administration's culture. Rossello's private chats with a group of male staffers demonstrate just how deeply the personal is political in what some (myself included) call the oldest colony of the USA.According to the Puerto Rico Governor's Office on Women (Oficina de la Procuradora de las Mujeres) the number of women killed by an intimate partner nearly doubled from 14 in 2017 to 26 in 2018. And the women saw it coming. ""We warned the administration that there was going to be a rise in violence after the hurricane. After a catastrophic event we know trends. But our warnings have fallen on deaf ears"" Gonzalez fumed. Paz Para la Mujer and Seguimiento de Casos an organization run by a group of retired social workers are keeping tabs on the murders because women activists don't trust official numbers. They comb news reports and gather numbers from women advocates all over the island. Since the start of 2019 19 women have been murdered nine of them by an intimate partner including a 13-year old girl whose 19-year old boyfriend poured gasoline on her and set her on fire. Colectiva Feminista en Construcción (Feminist Collective in Construction) is among the leading groups calling attention to gender violence on the island. The collective has been leading sit-ins in different parts of the island and in front of the governor's mansion—La Fortaleza. For three days in November 2018 the women held posters with grim statistics. They banged on drums. They chanted. They held vigils. They sang. They yelled. They continue to protest.""Women are living in abhorrent crisis every single day"" bristled Vanessa Contreras one of the leaders of Colectiva Feminista who have been actively protesting and demanding action by Rossello. ""He did not come out to ask why we're so concerned why we are so angry"" said Gonzalez who joined the Colectiva Feminsita sit-ins. Advocates like Gonzalez and Colectiva Feminista say Rossello's words are an offensive reminder of a dark reality too many women are facing. ""The language that the governor expressed in the intimacy with his friends is the same language that we hear from aggressors"" Gonzalez said. ""I am so furious. We can't allow this violence to be normalized.""Gonzalez and Contreras said that they and thousands of women who advocate on behalf of women will continue to protest every day until Rossello resigns. But they won't stop when he resigns. They will keep pressure on his replacement until the government declares a state of emergency about the epidemic of violence against women. They are also calling for the cancellation of billions of dollars of debt. They want the Financial Oversight and Management Board of Puerto Rico known on the island as the Junta (the Congressional board that oversees the debt and that has been implementing austerity measures including closing schools and cutbacks on basic services) to stop imposing more painful cutbacks some of which target programs that help women. Calling for a state of emergency women advocates say will bring seriousness to the issue of gender violence and direct government funds toward programs to help. They want the issue of violence to be handled holistically—tackling a culture of machismo everywhere from schools to government agencies to law enforcement. Puerto Rican women have endured dehumanizing violence for a long time. In the mid-20th century for instance island women were forced to undergo sterilization and the contraceptive pill was tested in a Puerto Rico housing project. They were the first human guinea pigs to have endured OxyContin tests. A Los Angeles Times investigation on the opioid crisis found that in the 1989 a group of unsuspecting Puerto Rican women recuperating from abdominal and gynecological surgery were given opioids to test the efficacy of the narcotics the same drugs which have caused devastation all over the USA. ""Basta ya!"" Gonzalez said as we finished our conversation which translates to enough is enough. ""We will not be killed sexually assaulted tested on beat and raped any more."""
358,Mr. President leave declaring war to Congress,William D. Hartung,CNN Opinion,-2,https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/24/opinions/congress-end-executive-branch-declare-war-power-hartung/index.html,"The House of Representatives just took a historic step toward ending the policy of perpetual war that has governed US foreign policy during this century. Eighteen years after the passage of the 2001 Authorization of Military Force (AUMF) which essentially gave the executive branch a blank check for going to war the House passed an amendment by Democratic Rep. Barbara Lee that will sunset that 2001 measure within eight months of its passage into law. The original authorization was supposed to target ""nations organizations or individuals [the President] determines planned authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 2001 or harbored such organizations or persons"" but it has been applied to situations that go well beyond this definition. The aim of Lee's legislation is to restore Congress' constitutional authority to prevent the executive branch from launching unnecessary ""wars of choice"" -- like the largely disastrous US intervention in Iraq. Getting the Republican-controlled Senate to follow suit and overcoming a potential veto by President Donald Trump will be a tough road but well worth the effort if it puts the issue of congressional authority to sign off on the use of military force front and center between now and 2020.This measure is particularly important now as tensions with Iran run the risk of sparking yet another war in the Middle East. In a closed-door briefing last month members of Congress expressed concern that the administration might wrongly invoke the authorization for the use of military force approved after September 11 to go to war with Iran. Testifying to the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday the administration's point man on Iran Brian Hook dodged the question stating only that it would ""comply with the law"" in deciding whether to take military action against Iran. But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's dubious claims of a significant relationship between Iran and al Qaeda suggest that the administration is at least considering using the 2001 AUMF to justify a war with Iran. Thankfully last week Trump pulled back from the brink and decided not to bomb Iran in response to Tehran's shooting down of an US surveillance drone. As Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group has noted if a military action against Iran were to escalate to a full-scale war it would ""make the Afghan and Iraqi conflicts look like a walk in the park."" It could also cost hundreds of billions of dollars. The House action to restrict the President's war powers is long overdue given the high price of our post-9/11 wars. According to Brown University's Costs of War Project the US wars of this century will cost over $5.9 trillion once obligations for lifelong care of the veterans of these conflicts are taken into account. These financial costs immense as they are can't begin to express the human consequences of these conflicts which have left over 4423 US troops dead and 31597 wounded and hundreds of thousands more with traumatic brain injuries or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). And by a conservative estimate more than 480000 people have died on all sides of these wars. Meanwhile the number of terrorist groups operating around the world has multiplied. There is growing evidence that the American public is tired of our forever wars. An October 2018 survey by the Charles Koch Institute found that only 21% of Americans feel that the United States has a ""clear strategic objective"" in Afghanistan and a Pew poll from November of that year indicated that only about one-third of voters think hunting down terrorists in other countries should be a priority. Veterans organizations such as VoteVets and Concerned Veterans of America which occupy opposite ends of the political spectrum have joined forces to press for a withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan and a repeal of the overly permissive 2001 AUMF as the House has just voted to do. The mood in Congress with regard to war powers has been shifting over the past few years as evidenced by the historic passage in both houses of bills that would have ended US support for the brutal Saudi-led war in Yemen under the War Powers Resolution. Although Trump ended up vetoing the resolution it remains a testament to growing congressional opposition to counterproductive unauthorized wars. The bipartisan nature of this opposition was underscored in an April 4 letter to the President urging him not to veto the resolution. It was signed by a group of members that included Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna Republican Rep. Thomas Massie Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders along with Republican Sens. Mike Lee and Rand Paul. The letter called for an end to the unconstitutional US role in Yemen as a way to ""set a new precedent for cooperation with both chambers of Congress"" on issues of war and peace. Since then Republican Rep. Andy Biggs and Democratic Rep. Khanna have started a new War Powers Caucus which in the words of Khanna is designed to lead the way to ""re-establish congressional war-making power military restraint and [remove] the U.S. from endless wars as the pillars of our foreign policy."" Despite his veto of the Yemen legislation and his failure to end any of the wars he inherited even Trump has on occasion acknowledged that the era of perpetual war needs to come to an end. During his campaign for President he routinely referred to the Iraq War as a ""disaster"" and he has noted that the trillions spent on our Mideast wars could have gone a long way in rebuilding America. In this year's State of the Union address Trump stated flatly ""Great nations do not fight endless wars."" Strong action by Congress will help tip the balance away from a policy of ever more war and toward one grounded in diplomacy and economic cooperation -- with force reserved as an instrument of last resort when there is a serious threat to the United States that can't be resolved through other means. Never again should the United States go to war without the authorization of Congress. The next step is for the Senate to take action to repeal the 2001 AUMF and for Trump to sign it into law. America will be stronger and better for it."
359,When America seemed divided beyond repair something great came out of it,John Avlon,CNN Opinion,-2,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/18/opinions/apollo-11-when-america-seemed-divided-something-great-happened-avlon/index.html,"Fifty years ago America sent a man to the moon. It is a feat that will define our civilization in a thousand years. We hear a lot about how America can't achieve big goals anymore. We can't seem to summon political will across partisan lines. Adding to what can seem like an insurmountable hurdle is the fact that the moonshot occurred less than one decade after it was announced by JFK. These days it can take longer to build a bridge.Back in the summer of '69 when Neil Armstrong stepped down from the lunar lander to the surface of the moon and said ""One small step for man...one giant leap for mankind"" America was in the midst of a musical revolution that would shape world culture. The economy boomed throughout the 1960s extending a nearly decade-long economic expansion with an unemployment rate that was even lower than today.But if you talked to folks on the streets of America 50 years ago it did not necessarily seem like we were going through a glory period guided by the greatest generation.One year after the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. murders were at an all-time high -- more per capita than the current rate. American cities suffered devastating riots and fires between 1968 and 1969 that led to urban blight and a belief that our cities were in permanent decline. Not only were streets burning but bombs were going off at a frequency we can't imagine today. Between January 1969 and April 1970 there were more than 4000 domestic terror bombings in the United States costing 43 lives and causing more than $21 million in damage according to one Senate investigation. And while America was still rising as a superpower on the global stage we were on the way to losing our first war half a world away in Vietnam which took more lives than in all subsequent American wars combined. Lyndon Johnson's ambitious War on Poverty and Great Society would also be among the casualties. It's sometimes said that the good old days are good because they're gone. The fact is that America has always had its challenges. The future is always uncertain.So if you fear that America's best days are behind us it's worth remembering that a half century ago when we were putting a man on the moon many people felt America was divided beyond repair. But one hundred years before that the US survived a civil war in which more than 700000 Americans died and four million slaves were freed. We survived that crisis of confidence in our democracy despite the fact that our greatest president Abraham Lincoln was bookended by two of our worst -- the irresolute James Buchanan and the bitter Andrew Johnson.So while we should look clear-eyed at all our challenges and recognize that some of them are indeed dangerous and unprecedented -- with facts under attack and bigotry enabled from the White House while authoritarianism seem ascendant around the world -- we have been through far worse before. We've emerged fitfully and imperfectly stronger and wiser because of all we've experienced. We should continue to face the future without fear bolstered by the spirit JFK summoned when he aimed us toward the moon telling us that we should aim to new heights not because it is easy but because it is hard. The challenges we face today are significant but relatively small compared with overcoming slavery and the civil war -- or looking at the moon and deciding we would be the first to plant our flag there despite all the dangers and utterly inadequate technology at the time. Whether the challenge is at home or abroad or in outer space the goal to form a more perfect union becomes more bracing when the odds seem long. But it's invigorating to fight the good fight -- to confront fear with hope lies with truth and hate with love. And we do it armed with the idea that we will be proud of making a lasting positive difference and defining our time for the better. There is no perfect time in American history to harken back to. The question is always what to do with our time and how to define the challenges we will face and overcome clear-eyed in the knowledge that for all our faults it's never been wise to bet against the best of the United States of America."
360,For Biden the debate draw is a potential disaster and an opportunity,David Axelrod,CNN Opinion,-2,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/19/opinions/biden-debate-draw-potential-disaster-and-opportunity-axelrod/index.html,"I can imagine two reactions at Biden headquarters Thursdsay night when the lineups for the CNN debates in Detroit were drawn.The first is that this is a potential disaster. Flanked on the July 31 stage by two of his most aggressive attackers and several feisty progressives who are desperate for a big moment to keep their bids alive the former Vice President could find himself a frequent target.But as my middle school basketball coach always said every challenge is an opportunity.The front runner in polls Joe Biden who faltered in the first round of Democratic debates in June will have a chance to soothe his anxious supporters by confidently swatting down the incoming and proving that at age 76 he's still got game.One consequence of the random draw is that Biden who has struggled on questions of race will find himself competing on the second night of back-to-back debates on a stage that includes every candidate of color in the Democratic field.Standing to the left of Biden will be Senator Kamala Harris of California. Her riveting made-for-TV takedown of the former VP in Miami over his opposition to mandatory school busing in the '70s was the iconic moment of the last debate.On Biden's right will be Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey who led the charge for a public apology after Biden boasted at a fundraiser of his working relationship in the 1970s with two of the Senate's most virulent segregationists. Booker who eventually got the apology has failed to get much lift and will be looking for a big moment in this debate to ignite his campaign the way Harris did last time. So too will the candidates who will fill out the stage including two flamboyant New Yorkers Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Mayor Bill de Blasio who are in danger of failing to make the cut for the next Democratic debate in September if they don't dramatically lift their poll numbers from the land of one percenters where they current languish. In September the eligibility requirements to qualify for future debates will double meaning candidates will be required to post at least 2 percent in four national polls between June 28 and August 28 and show 130000 unique donors to their campaigns. To have any hope of getting there Gillibrand and de Blasio -- who made a lot of noise in the last debate but little progress -- will need to break through in some dramatic way.And as Harris has proven there is no better way to achieve that than a face-off with the front runner.Gillibrand who has staked her campaign on her leadership on issues such as sexual assault could achieve that by challenging Biden over his long ago treatment of Anita Hill at the Supreme Court confirmation hearings of Clarence Thomas.De Blasio who got in late and is improbably hoping to muscle into a race already populated by several iconic candidates of the Left -- Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts -- was fairly hyperventilating in the first debate breaking in whenever he could. Look for him to create a moment with the moderate former VP on ideological grounds.Biden's heat also will include Julian Castro the former HUD secretary and San Antonio mayor who drew notice in the June debates for his muscular confrontation with his fellow Texan Beto O'Rourke over decriminalizing the border. He will be looking for another such moment perhaps with Harris who now is polling in the upper echelon of candidates and has vulnerabilities with the left over her record as a prosecutor.But Biden who is blessed and cursed to sit atop the polls should look forward to the honor of being a target throughout.For unknown reasons Biden was caught flat-footed by Harris in the first debate giving rise to new questions about his age and stamina. (I still don't understand why Biden didn't play his strongest card when Harris challenged him which is his partnership with the nation's first black president -- ""Kamala Barack Obama examined every aspect of my record and chose me to be his Vice President. That should tell you all you need to know about my record and commitment on civil rights."")Biden also could fairly turn on Harris for appearing the day after the last debate to walk back her position on busing to something that sounded a lot like Biden's voluntary-not-compulsory position. And he might challenge her on her on-again off-again support of Sanders' plan to replace the entire private health insurance system under Medicare for All.If the front runner who appears on the stage in Detroit is strong agile and confident in handling the incoming -- and unapologetically claims the mantle as moderate -- he could take a big step toward solidifying his status at the top of his pack. If not the lamentations about his ability to go the distance will grow louder.Harris vaulted to the top tier in polling after her last debate. The upcoming the debate offers a chance to go beyond her moment and deliver a clear message something she has yet to do.If you believe as I do that the ultimate argument against President Trump is that his gleeful nasty and unremitting penchant to divide the country is a dispiriting and exhausting barrier to progress the charismatic Harris could emerge as a force to heal the breach. But that would require her to commit to such a message.By the luck of the draw Sanders and Warren will stand side-by-side on the July 30th stage -- the first of the two CNN debates -- surrounded by an array of moderates.The two who publicly profess their undying friendship are locked in a fierce and bitter struggle for many of the same voters. Will all those expressions of comity fall by the wayside when the meet onstage in Detroit?Their presence also makes them potential targets for the more moderate candidates on the platform. Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend the surprising early season phenom and fundraising champion has the most to gain by carving out that turf.Buttigieg a 37-year-old gay Afghanistan War veteran has impressed with his fluent New Generation appeal. He will be standing to the right of Sanders who is 77 and that's an image the younger candidate probably relishes. But his poll numbers have plateaued in the single digits and he now needs to flesh out his compelling rhetoric with deeper insight into what his new ideas campaign is about.Buttigieg could be one candidate who challenges Sanders and Warren on health care positioning himself as a pragmatic progressive from the center of the country -- not far from Iowa where the whole dance begins in February.Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota whose whole campaign has been staked on Midwestern moderation was on the platform with Warren in the first debate and failed to engage her. If Klobuchar is going to go anywhere in this race warm and funny will not be enough. She will have another chance in Detroit to aggressively challenge Sanders and Warren over the issue of where Democrats should stand on health care immigration and other defining issues.O'Rourke who will be flanking Warren began the year as a bona fide top tier candidate but has underperformed expectations and badly needs a reset. He was more apparition than contender on the first debate stage in June wilting under Castro's immigration attack and retreating to a corner where he remained almost silent for the rest of the debate.O'Rourke could make steak out of hamburger seeking moderate turf by explaining why he almost alone among the field would not change the law to make border crossing a civil rather than misdemeanor criminal offense. Many including me viewed the headlong match to decriminalization in the last debate to be a gift to President Trump who already has announced his strategy to portray Democrats as the party of ""open borders.""Or O'Rourke who has made criminal justice reform a hallmark issue could challenge Buttigieg from the left for his record in South Bend where a recent police-involved shooting has raised questions about the mayor's leadership on police-community relations.There will of course be other moderates on the stage. Governor Steve Bullock of Montana former Governor John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio are closer to elimination than nomination and also may use Sanders and Warren as foils to create a campaign-saving moment.But however it plays out the debate cards produced by The Draw provide two vastly different lineups and a host of possible scenarios for events that could have dramatic implications for the future.De Blasio who got in late and is improbably hoping to muscle into a race already populated by several iconic candidates of the Left -- Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts -- was fairly hyperventilating in the first debate breaking in whenever he could. Look for him to create a moment with the moderate former VP on ideological grounds.Biden's heat also will include Julian Castro the former HUD secretary and San Antonio mayor who drew notice in the June debates for his muscular confrontation with his fellow Texan Beto O'Rourke over decriminalizing the border.

361,An open letter to officials who won't meet with a woman alone,Jen Psaki,CNN Opinion,-2,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/19/opinions/mississippi-lawmakers-billy-graham-rule-psaki/index.html,"Dear State Representative Robert Foster and former Chief Justice Bill Waller Jr. At a time when young people in your state of Mississippi are dealing with both the lowest earnings and the highest unemployment rate for their age group when tens of thousands of people don't have health insurance in part because of the refusal of current leadership to expand Medicaid you have made your way into the headlines by boldly pledging not to meet alone with a woman other than your wife. Congratulations to both of you for all of this national coverage. Your constituents probably won't know anytime soon if ever whether this proclamation was inspired solely by the teachings of Billy Graham by a fascination with the Victorian era or doubts about your own self control but there are a few questions to consider to make sure you are achieving your stated goal of avoiding speculation resulting from the evils of the #MeToo movement. Is having another man present really the answer? So I understand you think that having another man present will really help you control your unbridled masculine urges but doesn't having two men present with a woman make it even more questionable? According to your way of thinking I would feel a lot safer as a supporter of the #MeToo movement if you had two women present instead. Should you really be meeting alone with men either? It is very clear that you believe marriage is only between a man and a woman despite the rulings of the Supreme Court and therefore any sexual relations are only between a man and a woman. But wouldn't it help avoid and question that you are going outside of your marriage with a man if you always had a woman present as well?What kind of women should be present? Now that I think about it it would really make sense for these women chaperones to be married and also mothers. I mean who can even trust a married woman if she hasn't yet procreated? How do you make sure you are taking into account their roles as wife and homemaker? From reading your statements it sounds like you really value the role of wives mothers and homemakers so you should also factor in what work schedule will make that possible. These married mothers who will be the acceptable chaperones will need to be able to drop their children off at school and pick them up and will probably need an hour or two mid-day to ensure your shirts are pressed the home is clean and that the evening meal has been prepped so that it can be on the table when their husbands finish their hard day of work. This likely means you have a window of 10 a.m.-12 p.m. for any meetings. Should you consider body cameras? Now I don't want to overthink this too much but at the end of the day it is your word against someone else's. So to be absolutely certain you won't run into trouble you should consider committing to recording all private meetings and making that video available to the public -- including your meetings with lobbyists lawmakers and financial supporters. Yes you will need a wide lens to fit all the chaperones into the shot but this level of transparency will ensure you are protected. Having worked in government for quite a few years myself I will admit these are pretty cumbersome guidelines if you want to get something done as governor of Mississippi. So in case it all feels like too much I have also taken the liberty of outlining an alternate approach. Don't touch anyone inappropriately. This sounds pretty straightforward but as a rule of a thumb a handshake with a person of any gender will do.Don't make any remarks about a woman's figure including her bust or backside. This includes comments that were once acceptable such as ""nice rack"" or ""your butt looks great in that skirt."" I am happy to provide an additional list if this is not clear enough. Don't ask anyone including women for a sexual favor because of your place in power. This is generally a good rule to follow even if you are not elected but there are a number of cases I am sure you are aware of that have left your fellow former and current public servants in hot water as a result.Hire women to be on your senior team. I know this one probably sounds extreme but having a woman's perspective and the counsel and advice of a group of women you trust may turn out to be illuminating. And if you follow rules 1-3 you won't have any issues.Finally if you are looking for anyone to help you overcome your fear of any supposed lying confused or predatory women in public service and journalism I know a number of excellent professionals of all political stripes who can help you overcome your fear of powerful women. I am easy to reach.SincerelyJen Psaki"
362,Congresswoman Maloney: Trump misled us in his economic report. I'm setting the record straight,Carolyn Maloney,CNN Opinion,-2,https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/18/perspectives/trump-economic-report-carolyn-maloney/index.html,"Every year the public gets a window into the White House's views of the economy when the administration publishes the Economic Report of the President. Typically it is a dense but interesting read offering a data-driven assessment of the economy and highly anticipated by economists policymakers and others who care about economic policy. However the Trump administration's 2019 report is a sharp departure from those of previous administrations. This year's report misconstrues well-established facts cherry-picks data relies on economic theories widely rejected by mainstream economists and entirely omits critical subjects. I correct the record in the Joint Economic Committee Democratic response to the report which is mandated by law and was released Thursday.The report claims full credit for economic conditions that President Trump mostly inherited from President Obama. At the time of President Trump's inauguration the unemployment rate was 4.7% and trending down while the economy had added jobs for 76 straight months. Moreover the average monthly job growth during the last two years of the Obama administration was stronger than the first two years of the Trump administration. Even so Trump implausibly has claimed that he has achieved an economic turnaround. The Trump administration's economic forecast is also extremely optimistic compared to those of respected nonpartisan sources like the Federal Reserve and the Congressional Budget Office. It's The administration's estimates of real GDP growth of 3% or greater each year through 2024 are 50% higher than the Federal Reserve's and assume implausible legislative victories such as the permanent extension of the personal income tax changes in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in order to achieve its forecasts.The report exaggerates the impacts of the Republican tax cuts which mainstream economists have characterized as a short-term sugar rush and an unnecessary stimulus of an already-hot economy. While private investment increased in 2018 much of the gains may have resulted from changes in oil prices. Even with the boost from oil prices private investment grew more slowly in 2018 than in 2011 or 2012. And the $1.9 trillion cost of the tax cuts will weigh on the economy for years into the future. There is only brief consideration in the report given to the economic status of Millennials who now make up the largest generation in the workforce. It ignores their experience entering the job market and beginning their careers during and in the wake of the worst recession since the Great Depression. Many Millennials have depressed wages and more student debt and fewer of them own homes than previous generations at the same stage of their lives. In one of its most erroneous claims the report declares that President Johnson's War on Poverty ""is largely over and has been a success"" based on 1963 standards of material hardship. It uses an alternative measure of poverty to find that only 2.3% of Americans live in poverty compared to the official poverty rate of 12.3%. This makes light of the daily challenges facing the nearly 40 million Americans who live in poverty and the millions more who move in and out of poverty during their lives. With such an overly optimistic assessment of poverty it is not surprising that the report says little about the critical issue of income and wealth inequality which has widened dramatically over the past four decades. It also sidesteps issues of race class gender education age and geography.Finally the report almost entirely omits the subject of climate change perhaps the greatest challenge facing the global economy in coming decades. Rather than ignoring major challenges before us or claiming all is right with the economy we should invest in our communities and our people. Let's start by rebuilding our broken infrastructure expanding opportunity to the millions of Americans who still have not benefited from the recovery reining in prescription drug prices taking actions to reduce income and wealth inequality making higher education more accessible and affordable and recognizing — at every level of the federal government — that climate change is a global threat that requires immediate and bold action.It is an ambitious agenda. But that is what the American people deserve and that's what congressional Democrats are committed to delivering."
363,Don’t Worry America Jared Kushner Is Going to Save You From COVID-19,Molly Jong-Fast,The Daily Beast,-2,https://www.thedailybeast.com/dont-worry-america-jared-kushner-is-going-to-save-you-from-covid-19?ref=wrap,Wednesday during the latest installment of his daily briefings that have become must-see TV New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he spoke with Jared Kushner. You know Kushner—the president’s son-in-law. The president's son-in-law is a member of the president’s COVID-19 taskforce but he is not a doctor or an elected official. In fact Jared has no experience handling pandemics or any medical background whatsoever. Jared Kushner doesn’t know about science or medicine but Cuomo must appeal to him for help from the federal government.And that’s not the only place the president’s son-in-law has popped up the last few days.  One of the biggest questions we've all been puzzling over is why won’t the president invoke the wartime Defense Production Act to force companies to make ventilators? He “signed two executive orders citing provisions of the Defense Production Act” but then refused to use those provisions. Later it was revealed that Trump refused to use the wartime law “reportedly after corporations successfully lobbied his top adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner.” Meanwhile Cuomo holds continual pressers that have the same refrain again and again: “We need the federal help and we need the federal help now.”As the pandemic fills New York City’s morgues the president has decided to bring in the very best and smartest people. For Donald Trump that’s his son-in-law Jared Kushner. And it just makes sense since Jared has already brought peace to the Middle East and innovated America within an inch of its life with his office of American innovation. Now it’s time for the young slumlord to once again fail upwards. This time hundreds of thousands of American lives are at stake but I mean Jared did go to Harvard (via a $2.5 million donation) so…First Jared explained to his father-in-law that the media was making too much of the whole pandemic thing. “Mr. Kushner’s early involvement with dealing with the virus was in advising the president that the media’s coverage exaggerated the threat” according to The New York Times. Sounds like Kushner agreed with Lou Dobbs—you know Fox Business Channel’s Lou Dobbs who’s in quarantine right now because he was exposed to liberal hoax COVID-19.But wait there's more. It turns out that Jared is as good at handling a pandemic as he is at Middle East peace. First he asked his brother’s wife’s dad for advice on handling the outbreak. Dr Kurt Kloss (father of model Karlie) wrote on Facebook “If you were in charge of Federal response to the Pandemic what would your recommendation be. Please only serious responses. I have direct channel to person now in charge at White House and have been asked for recommendations.” I mean it makes sense since he’s a doctor and Facebook is a highly regarded and peer-reviewed medical journal.Then Jared got going on what he does best innovation. You’ll recall that error-filled Oval Office address followed by the error-filled Rose Garden address and the promise as the Times reported that “Google had developed a coronavirus testing website that did not exist. Mr. Kushner was deeply involved in both efforts and had sold his father-in-law on the website as a smart concept.” This fiasco ended with Dr Deborah Birx holding a large poster board of a Google testing site that doesn’t exist. But that was a week ago. Since that innovation we learn that Trump has pivoted to an Easter society-restart date. and Jared may have had his hand in that too. As Vanity Fair reported “Jared is bringing conspiracy theories to Trump about potential treatments” leading Trump to think he can ignore the person who actually knows about pandemics and public health Dr. Anthony Fauci.But Jared’s not the only one in the Trump family hoping to use the pandemic to grow their brand. Ivanka is trying her hand at being a coronavirus lifestyle influencer. When she came into contact with the Australian minister Peter Dutton and was sent home to isolate Ivanka then suggested a faux -out with her children: “Staying home today w/ kids? Plan living room camp out!” she suggested on Tuesday alongside a photo taken a few years ago of her hanging out with the children in a tent made out of sheets. Plan a menu & ‘pack’ sandwiches salads (S’mores optional)! A fun activity that also brings family together for a meal!”  The irony is that Ivanka’s dad is famous for putting immigrant children in tent cities in the hopes of owning the libs. But Ivanka’s COVID-influencer lifestyle seems to have ended. She tested negative (there seem to be unlimited COVID-19 tests for the royal family) and is back at work in the White House doing whatever it is she does.One might find the fact that one in 1000 people in the New York City metro area are infected with COVID-19 terrifying. But not me. No I have confidence that the president’s son-in-law will handle this with his usual competence. I mean we have peace in the Middle East now so... Wait we don’t? Oh well then. I would say we’re all in a lot of trouble. But if we survive just think about how good this will be for the Trump brand and for Ivanka’s 2024 run. If we don’t die that is.
364,These Republicans Think Trump’s Easter Deadline Doesn’t ‘Make Sense’,Hunter Woodall,The Daily Beast,-2,https://www.thedailybeast.com/these-republicans-think-trumps-easter-coronavirus-deadline-doesnt-make-sense?ref=wrap,Republicans are often keen to follow Donald Trump’s lead. But faced with whether or not to go along with the president’s Easter deadline to begin reopening the country from the coronavirus pandemic 2020 GOP candidates are all over the map. Tension over public health measures have begun to play out nationwide as long grocery store lines closed schools and major canceled events serve as the backdrop for a nation sent reeling by the pandemic on Trump’s watch. In the crowded GOP race to replace Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock in Montana Al Olszewski a Republican state senator and orthopedic surgeon emphasized there is no one size fits all approach that works nationwide and isn’t predicting “business as usual come Easter.” “I am hopeful that we can open up and start opening up our economy come Easter time but I don’t think that it’s going to be opened up 100 percent” he said. “I think it should be phased in to try to get us back up to full speed. It’ll probably take us two to three months to do so and it’s dependent on successful treatments. It’s dependent on the availability of testing.”Olszewski said he understands that Trump “is trying to be our cheerleader” and “provide optimism.” There’s plenty of fear and anxiety in Montana he said where people are more worried about their business and taking care of their family than they are of getting sick. “With the president as the cheerleader I know that he’s got people behind him that I’m sure are going to be more measured and will create phases” Olszewski said. “That’s just the public health way.” There are 11 races for governor on the ballot nationwide in 2020 according to The Cook Political Report with seven currently controlled by Republicans. But in the four states held at the moment by Democratic governors some GOP challengers were quick to wrap their arms around Trump’s approach as they look ahead to either longshot election chances or contests where they come in already at a disadvantage. “Impossible deadlines to solve impossible problems are what we are all about” North Carolina’s Lt. Governor Dan Forest who is running to oust the state’s Democratic governor said in a statement. “Today’s challenge could be our moonshot our version of the Apollo mission.” Experts have derided the timeline and even officials in the administration’s pandemic effort have shied away from the president’s hope for an April 12 return during the daily coronavirus briefings. “America is a creative innovative resourceful and compassionate nation” Forest said in his statement. “Stopping the Coronavirus pandemic and getting the economy up and running again can and must be done at the same time.” Republicans in the era of Trump have been loath to break too far from the president but some incumbent governors facing re-election while leading their respective states through the pandemic on a daily basis were quick to push back on any Easter promises this week. North Dakota may have put on controls later than some places Republican Gov. Doug Burgum said during a press conference Tuesday but that could mean those controls remain on longer in the state than in other places “that are relaxing them.”“Picking one date for the entire United States likely wouldn’t make sense” Burgum said when asked about Trump’s Easter timeline.A similar sentiment came across the country from New Hampshire’s Republican governor a state that is a possible pickup opportunity for Trump in November’s general election. “What we are not going to do is overly accelerate or loosen regulations just for the sake of the economy at the risk of public health” Gov. Chris Sununu said during a press conference earlier this week. “...So whatever message is coming out of Washington we’re going to take care of New Hampshire first.”As the pandemic began to freeze life nationwide Trump’s approach from the White House veered to concerns about a dire economic picture. Whether it came during a Fox News Town Hall held in the Rose Garden or during one of the daily White House press briefings Trump’s fretting about the economy has come sharply into focus as large scale legislation aimed at boosting the economy has been considered in Congress. In recent days Trump has fixated on the country not shutting down and pushed the idea that an economic recession or depression could lead to death in “far greater numbers than the numbers that we’re talking about with regard to the virus.” By midweek his fixation on re-opening the country had moved to the conspiracy theory that reporters were the “dominant force” in the country trying to keep the country “closed as long as possible” so that it would hurt his re-election chances in November. Later that same day after he had frequently touted a push to reopen the country weeks instead of months Trump said he wouldn’t “do anything rash or hastily.” “I don’t do that” Trump said. Trump also wasn’t specific during Thursday’s coronavirus task force briefing when asked about guidelines possibly being extended. “When we’re open as soon as we open that doesn’t mean you’re going to stop with the guidelines” Trump said. “You’ll still try and distance yourself. Maybe not to the same extent because you have to lead a life.”Later on in the briefing Vice President Mike Pence pledged they would “listen to the very best health experts in the world.”“We’ll be presenting this weekend the president a range of recommendations and additional guidance for going forward” Pence said. “The president’s made it clear that in his words he wants to open the country up but we’re going to do that responsibly and as the president told the governors today we’ll do that based on the data.”A fixation on the economy is shared by some candidates. In Minnesota one Republican senate candidate urged in a statement Wednesday for his state to “ease” restrictions put in place over the virus next week. “By ‘preferentially protecting the medically frail and those over age 60’ and letting healthy working-age Minnesotans go back to work we can avoid extending the very real social—and eventually health—costs of a second Great Depression” Republican Jason Lewis said. The president’s response to the pandemic has been described as slow by some and different Republican and Democratic governors nationwide have implemented their own strict measures in an effort to keep their state’s residents safe. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine along with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee have been among the leaders aggressively pushing anti-virus measures. In Washington one of Inslee’s potential Republican challengers in November complained in an interview with The Daily Beast about people not being able to shop at a Best Buy and claimed to take some offense “over all these people that are going crazy over the fact that (Trump’s) calling it a Chinese virus.”“You need to minimize the number of businesses that are going to be affected otherwise the economic impact here is just going to be so far off the charts that the cure might be worse than the disease” Washington state senator Phil Fortunato said echoing a similar statement made by the president. The Republican described Trump’s Easter deadline as “sort of ambiguous statements.”“It’s a guess” Fortunato said. “I mean nobody knows what to do. Nobody knows how this is gonna go.”
365,Insurance Companies to Small Businesses: Sorry We Don’t Cover Viruses,Dean Obeidallah,The Daily Beast,-2,https://www.thedailybeast.com/insurance-companies-to-small-businesses-sorry-we-dont-cover-viruses?ref=wrap,"“Running a business can be difficult without the right business insurance. One coverage most businesses need is business interruption insurance also known as business income insurance. It can help replace any income your business loses if you can’t open for a time after a covered loss.” Those words appear on a major insurance company’s website as it like insurers across the country tries to entice small-business owners to plunk down anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars a month for business interruption coverage that promises to help “pay bills replace lost income and cover payroll when a covered event forces your business to close temporarily.” Well if ever we were in a situation where that’s the case it’s now. But now that the owners finally need this coverage to keep their small businesses afloat insurance companies are telling them they’re not covered for COVID-19 related closures. At one time before I saw the light I was a lawyer in a big law firm where we represented large insurance companies. As I saw firsthand everyone thinks they have a great insurance policy—until they make a claim. And then it becomes like the classic scene in Willie Wonka & the Chocolate Factory where Wonka tells Charlie’s grandfather that Charlie doesn’t get the promised chocolate factory because he violated a little-known term of the contract: “Under section 37B of the contract… ‘I the undersigned shall forfeit all rights privileges and licenses herein and herein contained et cetera et cetera…’” ending with Wonka telling them “You lose! Good day sir!”“You lose! Good day sir!” is exactly what insurance companies are now telling small-business owners based on an exclusion in the policy called—wait for it—the “Exclusion for Loss Due to Virus or Bacteria.” Yep tucked into just about every commercial business-insurance policy since 2006 is language that states “We will not pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from any virus bacterium or other microorganism that induces or is capable of inducing physical distress illness or disease.” In fact as insurance lawyers have noted this exclusion was inserted by insurance companies to prevent coverage for the very type of shutdowns we are seeing now caused by the COVID-19 outbreak. You think casinos rig the odds in their favor? You haven’t seen anything until you’ve read the list of exclusions in a commercial insurance policy. True everyone should read all the fine print before signing an insurance contract. But few small-business owners will and even if they do it’s unlikely all will understand the nuances of what is covered and what is not. And who before now would think of asking an insurance broker: “In the case of worldwide pandemic caused by a coronavirus outbreak am I covered?!”  Instead people considering insurance more likely will look at an insurance company’s website for guidance about what is not covered such as at the bottom of one company’s page that states “Closures caused by flood earthquakes or broken glass typically are not covered in a business interruption policy.” (No other exclusions of coverage are noted.)But now people like Norm a small-business owner from Florida (and a listener to my SiriusXM radio show) who forwarded me the denial of coverage letter from his insurance agent are told no coverage “due to loss by virus or bacteria.” In Louisiana the owner of several truck stops who is now losing $30 000 to $40000 a month is also out of luck due to that same exclusion and the list of small-business owners denied coverage goes on and on. This situation did get the attention of some elected officials. In the House a bipartisan group of 18 members of Congress sent a letter last week to four of the largest insurance trade organizations urging them to provide business interruption coverage despite the “virus” exclusion. However the response by the insurers was a resounding “no”: “Business interruption policies do not and were not designed to provide coverage against communicable diseases such as COVID-19.”  The stimulus bill expected to be signed into law shortly does provide billions in loans for small-business owners but that’s far different than getting a check from your insurance company to cover a loss. Instead now small-business owners will be required to apply to the government and comply with any terms imposed (it’s not clear yet what those will be) as they compete with hundreds of thousands of others business owners for limited resources. Plus a federal government loan has to be repaid while proceeds from your insurer do not. “Members of Congress sent a letter last week to four insurance trade groups but the answer came back a resounding ""no.""”I discussed this issue on my show Wednesday with Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) who explained that Congress is monitoring the issue and specific aid for business interruptions may be included in a future stimulus bill. In fact it’s such a growing issue in the Garden State that the New Jersey State Assembly is considering a bill to compel insurers to cover small business for business interruptions caused by COVID-19. The bill was recently pulled from a full vote over concerns about the legality of rewriting an insurance policy after it has been entered into by the parties.  So what happens if you are a small-business owner and you’re denied coverage for the business interruptions caused by the virus? Simple you can as the insurance company hopes just move on. Or you can hire an attorney at your own cost—it may be pricey given its commercial litigation—and sue the insurance company. Last week a Louisiana business sued its insurance company over this very issue reportedly marking the first such lawsuit in the nation. Expect more lawsuits. A lot more. But while these cases make their way through the courts expect insurance companies to keep doing what they’ve been doing all along: Collecting premiums and denying claims."
366,Fiona Hill: Trump’s Coronavirus Talk Sounds a Lot Like Russia’s,Eleanor CliftAdam Rawnsley,The Daily Beast,-2,https://www.thedailybeast.com/fiona-hill-trumps-coronavirus-talk-sounds-a-lot-like-russias?ref=wrap,Into an already toxic brew of political discord and hyperventilating social media a pathogen of foreign origin arrives. To fight it the country must unite. At the same time the coronavirus makes us more vulnerable to manipulation especially if people are scared and nobody seems to have good answers. Some of that manipulation is from Russia and some from China and while the two countries are “not working in close cooperation they are working in concert because they have similar goals” said Fiona Hill former national security official and Russia expert in the Trump White House. Hill gained public notice when she testified before Congress last year on how a “domestic political errand” about Donald Trump’s potential challenger hijacked U.S. policy toward Russia and Ukraine.  Now back at the Brookings Institution and an expert on Russian disinformation she talked to The Daily Beast about how Russia and China are exploiting the coronavirus pandemic. She began by noting “The way the president refers to the ‘Chinese virus’ is not helpful. It’s a way of deflecting responsibility for the outcome and that’s exactly what the Chinese and Russians are doing themselves.” China’s goal is to head off a huge public backlash in which countries might even try to sue China for reparations. “The Chinese bear a great deal of responsibility for covering up and trying to deny the early outbreak” she said. “China should be the skunk at everybody’s party. They don’t want to take responsibility for letting a localized virus become a global pandemic. And now with the United States in a prostrate position they can step in and take on a leader’s role.” Turning to Russia Hill said its behavior fits into a longstanding pattern that began with the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s. Back then the KGB launched a fairly successful covert disinformation campaign dubbed “Operation Infektion” to convince people that the virus was really a U.S. biological weapon. That was easy for people to believe because they knew governments experimented on vulnerable people.“We’ve been in this space a long time where there is a lot of misinformation that takes on a life of its own and governments use it for propaganda purposes to deflect from their own shortcomings and to mobilize the population against an external enemy” said Hill. “All they did is amplify our own discord.”In February after Hill’s departure the State Department briefed reporters on what it said was a social-media disinformation campaign waged by the Russian government in order to blame the U.S. for the spread of COVID-19. Experts say much of the COVID-19 disinformation put out by Russia and others is overt and focuses on amplifying America’s own political fissures and disinformation about the pandemic.“We continue to see accounts aligned with Russian state media work to sow discord in the United States by amplifying divisive content” explained Daniel J. Jones a former staffer for Sen. Dianne Feinstein who founded Advance Democracy Inc. which tracks online disinformation. “We typically track these efforts to exacerbate tensions in the context of elections but we’re now seeing these accounts amplify divisive content relating to the COVID-19 global pandemic to include offensive content relating to race.”Jones pointed to how Russia’s English-language state-media outlets have played up both sides of the debate over whether to label the coronavirus by its official name COVID-19 or the racially charged “Wuhan virus” preferred by the Trump administration. State-backed TV channel RT has blown off criticism of the “Wuhan virus”-style branding and wondered aloud whether the debate is “just media-manufactured outrage?” while the Russia-funded In the Now outlet highlighted the racist attacks on those of Asian descent that have taken place since the outbreak.The European Union’s strategic communications division which monitors Russian and other disinformation narratives released a report in mid-March that found Kremlin propaganda was identifying and amplifying coronavirus concerns in order to “to sow distrust and division.” The EU report claimed that rather than invest in new propaganda narratives much of Russia’s recent disinformation on COVID-19 was “simply amplifying theories that originate elsewhere e.g. in China Iran or the US far right.”As tensions with the U.S. reached a peak Chinese diplomats waged a disinformation campaign that exploited a long-running theme in American conspiracy media focused on Fort Detrick the former home of the U.S. Army’s long-shuttered biological-weapons program. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao led the charge on Twitter with a link to an article written by a Canadian conspiracy theorist that blamed Fort Detrick for the virus an idea that’s long circulated in domestic conspiracy circles. In 2009 Infowars correspondent Paul Joseph Watson wrote a post for Global Research—the same conspiracy outlet Lijian linked to—falsely claiming that the swine flu pandemic may have originated with a pathogen from Fort Detrick.Hill recounted her personal experience when she was one of the first people forcefully restrained at a Russian airport in September 1987 when the government decided while her student group was midair that HIV was a contagious disease and everybody entering the country had to be tested. The group of two dozen students spent a nervous 48 hours in the airport and were then quarantined in their dorm rooms until they got the results. Russia at the time was jailing people who spread STDs so there was some genuine nervousness about how HIV spread and about these possibly promiscuous students coming for a year Hill recalled with some amusement but as CNN and the BBC covered the standoff “it was also to show that a capitalist country was the source of this new scourge.” In 2016 Russia sowed confusion and chaos said Hill chiefly through social media. “They wanted Hillary grievously injured if she won. They didn’t expect Trump to win but the fact that he won under a massive cloud it’s a perfect outcome.” The uproar over Russia’s involvement undermined Trump’s legitimacy as a leader which served Russia’s interests as did Trump’s denigration of NATO. “Their goal has been to neutralize the U.S. and keep it out of the international arena as much as possible. The idea that the U.S. has lost leadership is deeply satisfying to Russia” said Hill author of the 2015 book Mr. Putin: Operative in the Kremlin. “2016 was about discrediting U.S. leadership” she said. In the 2018 midterm elections the hacking of systems wasn’t particularly significant. Rather “it’s the hacking of our minds that is the problem.”She continued “There is so much domestic disinformation tied to our own politics that the Russians don’t have to do much of anything to capitalize on what they already did in 2016. It’s basically a force multiplier for them. They don’t have to do anything on the scale of 2016.” She recalled the disbelief after Trump won the election that the Russians had been so effective using social media. “It was low-cost interference with a high payback. All they did is amplify our own discord. They were just sending it around retweeting—we all know that now—they just circulated around this disinformation to all kinds of groups.” It was information warfare Hill said geared to divide Americans and to break the resolve of government. “The Russians still see us as a threat” she added while Russia is seen by Trump “as a tool wielded by Democrats against the president.” Because the Mueller investigation into Russian meddling in the election was tied to his legitimacy Trump was hostile to it said Hill and because so many people couldn’t believe he would win with such a small margin he immediately attacked the premise of the investigation. It should have been framed differently she said around the question of “What did the Russians do?” not “What did Trump do?” “I think we would have ended up in the same place” with Paul Manafort Trump’s campaign manager indicted along with a number of Russian individuals she said “but it would have had more credibility.” Russia is not going to be immune to the virus. Reports show the number of cases climbing and after initially saying the virus was “under control” Putin canceled all incoming international flights except those with returning Russians and declared next week a stay-at-home holiday.“But they’re still geared up to push back on the U.S.” said Hill who urges a more rational discussion than what we got during the impeachment process when in her view partisanship furthered the tendency to make Ukraine the issue undermining the whole idea that there was collusion between the campaign and Russia. “We should be pulling together instead of attacking Ukraine” she said with some exasperation. As for Russia’s plans for the 2020 election Hill said: “I expect them to keep on doing what they already do because it’s proving successful for them. It’s also possible they will hack and dump—like they did with the DNC emails in 2016 and the releases to WikiLeaks. But the most effective approach is simply mining and amplifying all the disinformation that’s already out there in the U.S. political arena or things like looking for rifts between Biden and Bernie Sanders any grievance or discord we have that they can exploit. There’s so much potential material out there for them to use. Social media has proved extraordinarily useful—Facebook YouTube Twitter all have to police what they’re doing. This is not something that can be tackled on the government level.”
367,No One Puts Bernie in a Corner,Scott Bixby,The Daily Beast,-2,https://www.thedailybeast.com/bernie-does-his-damnedest-to-win-back-the-spotlight?ref=wrap,As the global economy American health infrastructure and Democratic presidential primary have ground to a halt there was one moment on Capitol Hill on Wednesday that amounted to a refreshing return to normalcy: the sight of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont sarcastically excoriating Republicans on behalf of the nation’s beleaguered working class.“I find that some of my Republican colleagues are very distressed they’re very upset that somebody who’s making 10 12 bucks an hour might end up with a paycheck for four months more than they received last week” Sanders said as the Senate debated a stipulation in the $2.2 trillion coronavirus relief bill that would pay low-wage workers more in relief wages than they might have earned if they were employed.Four Republicans— Sens. Lindsay Graham (SC) Ben Sasse (NE) Rick Scott (FL) and Tim Scott (SC)—had threatened to hold up the bill unless an amendment was passed to reduce unemployment benefits for the poorest workers.Sanders was not amused.“Oh my word will the universe survive?” Sanders shouted sarcastically. “How absurd and wrong is that? What kind of value system is that?”It was a return to form for Sanders who like former Vice President Joe Biden has largely been edged out of the national spotlight since their twin campaign events in Cleveland were canceled to prevent the further spread of the novel coronavirus. But two weeks after those final un-held rallies in hindsight the first dominoes to fall in a cascade of chaos that has thrown the Democratic presidential primary dramatically off course Sanders is clearly making a bid to win back his place at the center of the political conversation.What remains unclear is if he is seeking to do so in hopes of a Hail Mary delegate victory in June or because he still sees himself as the best messenger for a progressive message that he views as more critical than ever.“We are winning the ideological debate—I think especially in this terrible crisis that we’re in people understand that health care is a human right” Sanders said in an appearance on NPR on Thursday in remarks that didn’t give off the vibe that he plans on throwing in the towel any time soon.“You’re talking about an election without elections… that’s kind of unprecedented” Sanders continued adding that his campaign planned on going “virtual” with events “almost every single night.”Sanders’ message of social democracy remains strong even as his campaign—which has stopped airing television ads and is not raising money—weakens. But for Sanders’ backers the question of whether his continued pursuit of the nomination is to further an ideology or a candidacy is beside the point.“The avalanche started about ‘Why doesn’t he drop out?’ as if he were just any other candidate and he’s not any other candidate” said James Zogby founder and president of the Arab American Institute and a former member of the Democratic National Committee’s executive committee. He has advised Sanders to continue his campaign. Zogby likened most of Sanders’ fallen competitors to balloons inflated by positive media attention and donations that eventually fell back to earth when the money and media coverage ended. But Sanders he said “is not deflated.”“He therefore has a responsibility to continue to run” Zogby said. “This ain’t over ’til it’s over and it’s not over yet. Many things can happen in the next two months.”Sanders’ emergence from semi-sequestration in Vermont where he departed after a trio of wounding primary losses to “to assess his campaign” in the words of campaign manager Faiz Shakir has won him plaudits from left-wing advocates. Ideological allies on the left have publicly indicated that they view Sanders’ refusal to leave the race as a potential boon for the cause—even those who endorsed the presidential race’s other chief progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.“Thanks to the leadership of progressives in the Senate… the current bill now provides some measure of accountability for this half-trillion-dollar corporate slush fund” said Maurice Mitchell national director of the Warren-backing Working Families Party in a statement. “As record numbers of people apply for unemployment insurance Sen. Bernie Sanders fought tooth and nail to protect UI benefits that are the brightest spot in this package.”It remains unclear how committed Sanders is to the quest of actually winning the nomination a mathematical near-impossibility under current circumstances or if he sees his continued presence in the race as a means to an end like a more altruistic version of candidates who remain in the race to goose their chances of winning a cable news contributorship—but his public commitment to participating in any upcoming primary debate (which may not even exist) leaves little room for ambiguity.“Senator Sanders is still running for president” Mike Casca the campaign’s communications director declared on Wednesday. “If there is a debate in April he plans to be there.”The Biden campaign for its part is not publicly as irked by Sanders’ continued candidacy as it might be if the campaign-slash-world were operating under normal rules—although the former vice president’s patience may be wearing thin as he shifts into general election mode.“My focus is just dealing with this crisis right now—I haven’t thought about any more debates” Biden said on Wednesday about the prospect of another debate with Sanders. “I think we’ve had enough debates. I think we should get on with this.”
368,Tom Steyer MIA on Coronavirus Relief After $300 Million Vanity Campaign,Hanna Trudo,The Daily Beast,-2,https://www.thedailybeast.com/tom-steyer-mia-on-coronavirus-relief-after-dollar300-million-vanity-campaign?ref=wrap,Not too long ago Tom Steyer the billionaire Democrat who flooded the airwaves with an incessant push to impeach President Trump was virtually everywhere. Now he’s hardly visible.As the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread rapidly some of the nation’s wealthiest individuals are evaluating ways to help those most in need. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg who spent nearly $1 billion to self-fund his short presidential campaign committed through his philanthropy to giving $40 million to a global response fund and was part of a $75 million impact fund for his city. Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban another billionaire who briefly considered running for president in 2020 has given to help cover the salaries of arena workers during the stalled economy.“The country would be a far better place if the entire country starting with big money donors and PACs committed to redirect any and all political donations to supporting those in this country that have suffered because of the virus” Cuban told The Daily Beast.But when it came to advice about what Steyer and other high-dollar political donors should do in the midst of the pandemic Cuban demurred. “They should do what they think is right” he said. “Not up to me to judge.”Reached by The Daily Beast on Monday an aide to Steyer simply said: “Tom [is] still assessing his role in this crisis and the campaign going forward.”Steyer a top Democratic Party donor spent over $300 million on his presidential bid before abruptly ending it late last month. But as health concerns around COVID-19 deepen some are wondering why the billionaire Democrat has been largely missing from the response. His organizations NextGen America and Need to Impeach have not run any advertising on coronavirus to date on Facebook including warning the public about precautions according to data from Democratic digital firm Bully Pulpit Interactive shared with The Daily Beast. And his Twitter feed is sporadic with only occasional tweets about coronavirus in addition to an ongoing thread of book recommendations.  “With many of us stuck at home I thought I'd share some of the books that shaped my thinking on our climate crisis. I hope they inspire you the way they've challenged me to tackle this crisis head on. I'll keep sharing here so follow along!” Steyer tweeted on Friday.To some the lack of public spending has raised questions.“People who have that kind of money to spend it would be fantastic if they pitched in” said Vincent Perrone president of Teamsters Local 804 a union that represents UPS workers in New York. “They pick a cause because they want to be relevant but it’s a national emergency.”Perrone whose union represents 7300 people across Long Island New York City and into Westchester county said he’s realistic about the lack of available essentials like masks or gloves for his workers. “If a billionaire philanthropist would be able to pull 10950 face masks out of his ass and hand it to my local it would be fantastic” he said. “I know there’s no supply out there.” But he said a contribution in any form from ultra-wealthy individuals could go a long way to help his members get their basic needs met. “Even putting pressure or shifting some of their wealth to this factory’s production because it’s closed right now” he said throwing out a hypothetical scenario of giving. “We’ll take any help.”Other questions have already started to surface about the billionaire’s intention to give. When asked by anchor Christiane Amanpour in a recent interview on PBS about the Senate’s deadlock over the rescue package and how he views his role in helping to alleviate the burden of the pandemic Steyer pointed to his role in progressive politics. “The money I’ve spent for years [is] to try and enable the broadest possible democracy to support progressive candidates” Steyer said on Monday. “I did it right through my campaign I continue to do it today it will be bigger than it’s ever been in 2020. That’s the kind of effort I believe in.”“Coronavirus is a perfect example. So is climate. So is health care. We need a sea change in American politics and American leadership” he added. Jacob Harold the executive vice president of Candid a non-profit research organization said his group has “carefully” tracked over $2.2 billion in spending globally to fight COVID-19. But without a central place to write a large check assessing where to spend money effectively can be a tricky process. “It’s not like there’s the obvious place where you can write a $10 million check he said. “Spending money well is not always easy.” Harold noted there are four categories that giving can be sorted into in the midst of a crisis including relief support medical research and future resilience. Within those there’s a “strong argument to be made” that Steyer who has donated considerably over the years to tackle the issue of climate change could likely fit into the last category.Still as a major force in party politics Steyer has spent publicly in the recent past to meet the needs of the moment including dropping $123 million to help Democrats flip the House in 2018 and millions the following year on television ads during the height of the impeachment trial against Trump. While the public health nature of the crisis has touched every corner of life the response has been steeped in partisanship leading from the Republican-controlled White House and Senate. In the early hours on Wednesday morning the White House and Senate leaders reached a deal on a proposed $2 trillion package to serve as relief to the suffering economy. The legislation could arrive on Trump’s desk as soon as Thursday evening. While Steyer’s group NextGen America one of the biggest grassroots organizations in the country urged supporters to “send a message to Congress: Take emergency action on COVID-19” through a new page on its website there was no indication Steyer financially contributed. Instead the website includes a list of action items for officials in Washington including giving direct cash assistance and providing free health care to anyone impacted by the virus.  “I haven’t seen anything publicly yet from Steyer” said Maria Di Mento an expert in the area of billionaire donors who writes for the Chronicle of Philanthropy. “Just because it’s not happening publicly doesn’t mean it's not happening. It just means we don’t know about it.” If Steyer were to make a sizable public gift however some experts said it could encourage others to do so as well. “Money draws money” said Michael Thatcher the president of Charity Navigator the country’s largest independent evaluator of charities. “What I would love to see is more public giving right now because that would encourage others to do the same.”Thatcher indicated that one of the ways Steyer could be useful is to be as specific as possible about what his money should be spent on. “Is it a time to give? Absolutely. This is a huge time to give” he said. “Doing nothing is worse than just picking one and sticking to it.” Top articles1/5READ MOREDon’t Worry America Jared Kushner Is Going to Save You From COVID-19
369,The Coronavirus and Packed Prisons Make a Lethal Combination,Kali Halloway,The Daily Beast,-2,https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-coronavirus-and-packed-prisons-make-a-lethal-combination,Over-policing and its inevitable consequence mass incarceration have often been treated as unintended collateral consequences of well-intentioned efforts toward public safety. Criminalization of vulnerable communities militarization of law enforcement the inhumanity of overcrowded and underfunded prisons and jails—all are cast as imperfect but good faith means of keeping society from being sickened by its ills. Health pandemics though have a way of undermining “social order” lies exposing in-plain-sight systems of abuse that societies innovate and inflict on their most vulnerable citizens. In the U.S. which jails 2.3 million people more than any other nation in both raw numbers and per capita coronavirus has magnified the daily cruelties of mass incarceration—and created an urgent need to address them. Even in the so-called best of times “social distancing” is an impossibility in America’s overcrowded correctional facilities and immigration detention centers turning them into centers for contagion. Pandemic necessities such as soap are often in short supply while alcohol-based sanitizers—like the kind Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State prisoners were producing for under a dollar an hour though they may in fact just be rebottling existing product as “NYS Clean packaging”—are considered contraband for those living behind bars. The lives of incarcerated people are also all-too-often contaminated by the daily health threats of vermin raw sewage non-potable water black mold and other biohazards.All of those issues make corrections and detention centers highly efficient vectors of disease transmission not just for those who live imprisoned within their walls but also for people living in the communities around them. Corrections staff and visitors to prisons also move amongst the outside communities in which they live. Most of the people who fill America’s jails—the majority of whom are pretrial defendants who simply can’t afford bail—return home in under a month from conditions where social distancing is an impossibility. Researchers have found that “increases in a county’s jail incarceration rate were associated with significant increases in county rates of infectious disease deaths.” More specifically mass incarceration—the U.S. policy that has been used as a panacea for every societal ill dating back decades—”raises contagion rates for infectious diseases” across the board.Predictably we are now seeing coronavirus cases emerge in jails and detention centers around the country. As of Wednesday evening COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in nine corrections workers in New Orleans three staffers in Florida’s Miami-Dade Corrections and Rehabilitation Center five inmates in Dallas County jail and 17 detainees in Chicago. Jails in New York City—presently the American epicenter of the virus—report the highest number of cases with 75 inmates and 37 corrections staff at Rikers Island infected according to The Legal Aid Society. Those estimates artificially lowered by test shortages will likely climb in coming weeks. Beat cops in various police departments have also begun testing positive for COVID-19 with confirmed cases of coronavirus among cops in Los Angeles Detroit and New York City where there are a whopping 98 cases. Even with reported crime rates having plummeted in both cities because of quarantining against the virus detectives in New York and Los Angeles are being asked to return to street patrols. The coronavirus has illuminated our inability to police or jail our way our way out of what plagues us. For years criminal justice advocates have been pleading with officials to address the problems created by inhumane conditions prisoners face. The response has been slow with minor victories—New York City’s bail reform law comes to mind—constantly under threat of rollback because of scaremongering by opponents of criminal justice reform. It’s clear that mass incarceration has endangered public health by pretty much every measure with the greatest threat currently looming. Authorities now have the chance to actually address public health and safety by undoing some of it. That means releasing nonviolent offenders and those held on pretrial misdemeanor charges. The same goes for people who are jailed for technical violations of parole which can include infractions like failing a drug test or missing a court mandated meeting. For their part police officers and courts could stop penalizing people for minor misdemeanor and nonviolent offenses. “There's a lot that could be done by the mayor and a governor to release people that don't need to be in jail in the first place and wouldn't cause any public safety concerns” Darren Mack outreach and alumni engagement coordinator of JustLeadershipUSA told me. “You have people elderly people people who have already exhibited complications people sitting in jail pretrial because they can't afford bail—and hundreds of people incarcerated in Rikers Island on technical parole violations. All of those people should be released.”There has been movement. On Wednesday New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that 300 inmates serving less than a year on nonviolent offenses at Rikers Island will be released according to the New York Post. Another 800 inmates nearly all of whom are behind bars for technical parole violations will reportedly be freed in the near future along with all inmates who are infirm or over 70 years old. Other jurisdictions are to various degrees heeding the advice of advocates. In Baltimore officials are dismissing charges against most nonviolent offenders. Low-level and pretrial inmates in Austin. Citylab reports that “local jails in Chicago Louisville Austin Virginia Beach and Omaha have all begun releasing nonviolent offenders and pre-trial detainees.” New Jersey has enacted one of the most sweeping release policies freeing an estimated 1000 low-level offenders including those detained for parole violations. Los Angeles county jails released 1700 inmates a full 10 percent of those incarcerated. Those are necessary steps though there’s still more that could be done—and there are still districts that are resistant to early release for fear of seeming soft on crime. At the very least there is a growing acknowledgement of how prisons by design imperil the lives of those they house. And—in places where releases are happening to mitigate coronavirus’s impact—the knowledge that yet another unnecessary daily cruelty could’ve been solved before it became a matter of life of death.
370,Jared Kushner Slumlord Millionaire Can’t Evict the Virus,Morgan PehmeDaniel DiMauro,The Daily Beast,-2,https://www.thedailybeast.com/jared-kushner-slumlord-millionaire-cant-evict-the-virus?ref=wrap,In 2016 at the tender age of 35 Jared Kushner discovered America.Traveling with his father-in-law Donald Trump as he campaigned for president Kushner had the eye-opening opportunity “to really see the country” as he later recounted to CNN’s Van Jones.On this foray into the unexplored expanse between the coasts Kushner was surprised by what he observed. “There were a lot of issues that I thought about being in New York… but when I’d go out to the country I’d hear opinions that were differing from what a lot of the people in New York thought were the right prescriptions for them.”Presumably Kushner has become better acquainted since then with the experiences of Americans who dwell outside of his lifelong realm of mansions penthouses and boardrooms. We should all hope that is the case because Kushner now has enormous influence over the vital “prescriptions” that shape many facets of our lives including a leading role in combating the coronavirus crisis. As Trump’s 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale recently told Time other than the President “Nobody has more influence in the White House than Jared. Nobody has more influence outside the White House than Jared.”Unfortunately for so many of Kushner’s tenants in his former occupation as a Manhattan-based real estate mogul his awakening to the struggles of regular Americans came too late. In fact as we show in Slumlord Millionaire the episode we directed about Kushner for the Netflix documentary series Dirty Money Kushner was not just oblivious to the struggles of his tenants—he was the perpetrator of them.In New York City the Kushner playbook was to buy buildings with rent-stabilized tenants and then to harass them systematically with maddening construction until they moved out. Then Kushner Companies the family real estate firm of which Kushner was CEO from 2008 until January 2017 flipped the buildings to market rate and sold them for a significant profit.In the vicinity of Baltimore a city President Trump disparaged last September as a “rodent-infested mess” the Kushner model was even more insidious. In Maryland Kushner Companies owns and manages thousands of low- and middle-income rental units over more than a dozen housing complexes which investigative reporter Alec MacGillis collectively dubbed “Kushnerville” in a 2017 exposé. Unlike in New York City there wasn’t an economic incentive to push out Kushnerville’s tenants. Instead Kushner Companies maximized profits by spending minimally on the units’ upkeep while gouging the tenants with a slew of fees many of them dubious on top of their rent.It wasn’t just the residents of Kushnerville who were subject to these predatory practices; it was the former tenants of the complexes too. When Kushner Companies bought these buildings they went into the files of the previous owners looking for money to collect. One of these former tenants was Kamiia Warren a single mother of three who was working as a home health aide while also attending school.Kushner Companies relentlessly pursued Warren for $3014.08 for breaking her lease with the former owners. However Warren didn’t owe the money. She had received permission to move out early but years after vacating the property she no longer had the paperwork to prove it and didn’t know how to defend herself in a court system Kushner Companies expertly weaponized against her. Her Kafkaesque ordeal resulted in a legal judgment against her of nearly $5000. To collect three days before Christmas Kushner Companies began garnishing her paychecks. Then it zeroed out the $900 in her bank account leaving her destitute.As if that weren’t heartless enough Kushner Companies requested that the court approve a body attachment for Warren. A body attachment is a civil arrest warrant that enables the local sheriff to incarcerate debtors essentially for the crime of being poor. Kushner Companies was not alone in employing this draconian tactic but it employed it far more aggressively than any other real estate firm in the state.Fortunately MacGillis’s article resulted in Warren getting pro bono representation and once she had legal counsel in her corner Kushner Companies immediately caved and eliminated her debt. Why had Kushner Companies been so harsh in its dealings with vulnerable people like Kamiia? Kushner’s CFO told MacGillis the firm had a “fiduciary obligation” to its partners to maximize revenue. While this explanation may be morally bankrupt it is perfectly in line with how most businesses operate which is exactly the concern Americans should have in evaluating Kushner’s approach to policymaking.Concerns about conflicts of interest between Kushner’s opaque network of financial interests and the policies he is driving from the West Wing have abounded since the outset of the Trump administration. The coronavirus crisis has brought this dynamic into particularly sharp focus. They first flared up over Oscar a health insurance company co-founded by Joshua Kushner Jared’s brother. On March 13 the day Trump finally seemed to acknowledge the severity of the pandemic by declaring it a national emergency Oscar which was formerly jointly owned by Jared and Joshua launched a web portal to provide a number of coronavirus-related services. Though there is no evidence that Oscar is profiting from the administration’s approach the synchronicity of the timing along with the fact that a graphic displayed at Trump’s Rose Garden press conference resembled one in Oscar’s media release announcing its portal prompted questions about inappropriate coordination.Then on Monday Crain’s New York reported that the paralysis of commerce caused by the pandemic may force Kushner Companies’ Times Square retail space into default. The next day President Trump tamped down the medical community’s insistence on social distancing in favor of restarting the economy on an arbitrary accelerated timeline. Kushner who initially advised the president that the media was exaggerating the threat of the virus is serving as a liaison between the administration and business leaders a number of whom have agitated for a hasty return to the workplace. Trump has clearly been receptive to their lobbying at a time when his own family business The Trump Organization is struggling financially with six of his seven top revenue-generating hospitality businesses shuttered. In crafting policy is Kushner calculating the benefit to himself and his family or is he putting the health and welfare of the American people above all other considerations?Kamiia Warren certainly has her doubts. As she says in our film “I’m very nervous that Jared Kushner is someone that is making decisions for our country. I firsthand know how he conducts business.”
371,Trump’s New Plan: Become a Living ‘Everything Is Fine’ Meme,Sam Stein,The Daily Beast,-2,https://www.thedailybeast.com/donald-trumps-cure-for-the-coronavirus-good-vibes?ref=wrap,The dire shortage of protective medical gear needed to handle the spread of coronavirus is not some great secret. For weeks hospital administrators medical professionals and political leaders warned that this was a looming crisis. Increasingly it’s not even looming. Over the past few days photos have gone viral of nurses resorting to wearing trash bags and makeshift protective masks as they treat highly infectious patients. And yet to hear Donald Trump explain it the current situation is remarkable only for just how extraordinary the government has been in solving it. The same day that a nurse died at one of those hospitals where giant black trash bags have been converted into hospital gowns the president declared that when it came to filling medical equipment needs “It’s hard not to be happy with the job we’re doing.” The next day began with Trump tweeting “Congratulations AMERICA!” after the Senate passed a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus plan on a unanimous vote and ended with the news that America now has more coronavirus cases than any other nation in the world.The story is playing out in parallel universes: one where an abject crisis is causing historic economic disruption and human suffering on a global scale and one constructed by Trump in which—through his ingenuity and stewardship—America is on the precipice of putting this all behind us. “As we look forward” the president said on Tuesday “we begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel.” The next day the number of deaths in the U.S. reached a new peak. That Trump has built this alternate reality is not the least bit shocking. He has spent much of his life constructing and reconstructing tales of his grandeur. Public relations is his primary skill. So it’s only natural that he would apply it to a medical epidemic as well. What goes underappreciated is just how unorthodox such an approach is in politics. Under the usual constructs no politician in his or her right mind would act in his manner. Indeed the truism of crisis management is that leaders should avoid talking up how quickly things are improving lest they come off as insensitive to those still suffering. That certainly was the guiding principle in the wake of the last comparable economic disaster: the market collapse in 2008. In the early months of their administration Barack Obama and his team found themselves navigating a difficult balancing act: selling their legislative interventions and simultaneously nodding to widespread suffering by conceding that they still had work to do. On the occasions when they would try to put a positive gloss on their record (the so-called “recovery summer” and the talk of “green shoots” of economic optimism) it would usually result in admonitions about them being detached from reality.“It was one of the biggest questions we faced which is how to show we were on the right track without sounding out of touch” recalled Eric Schultz who was running communications for the Democratic Party’s Senate campaign arm during that cycle. “Atmospherically Republicans and the entire rightwing media were trying to talk down the economy and were obstructionists at the time. And so our ability to tell a positive story was harder in the face of that. They’d make the case of how out of touch we were and they’d be able to find plenty of case studies to show it was true.” By the time the 2010 cycle rolled around Obama had settled on a hackneyed electoral pitch: the economy was a car which Republicans had driven into a ditch. As he would say: “We’ve been pushing and shoving and sweating trying to get this car out of the ditch” while “Republicans have been standing there sipping on a Slurpee watching us and saying ‘You’re not pushing hard enough!’” Not surprisingly the elections were a disaster for Democrats. And in the aftermath some in the party criticized Obama for actually being too rosy in his salesmanship. “A metaphor about a car in the ditch when people are in trouble and angry at Wall Street is just out of touch with what is going on” Stan Greenberg the longtime Democratic pollster said after the electoral bloodbath.But if Obama was being too rosy back then Trump is acting positively Pollyannaish now. After a few days of sober talk about the coronavirus’ spread—conceding that it could sideline Americans well into the summer—he has spent the past week describing a disease that is close to being conquered. He has talked about reopening America’s economy by Easter overstated basic facts about the availability of treatments tests and therapies and blamed his predecessor and foreigners for any perceived failure all while giving himself a perfect score for his handling of the epidemic.To his critics he’s become the living embodiment of the “this is fine” meme—with the only question being if he is consciously aware of the fires that surround him. “We often debated the balance between touting progress and acknowledging reality but we almost always erred on the side of acknowledging the pain and hardship that people were experiencing as a result of the financial crisis” said Jon Favreau Obama’s former speechwriter. “I suppose it was fine for Trump to brag about the economy when the economy was in fairly good shape but a few months from now how will the absurd self-congratulation appear to people who’ve lost a job or lost a loved one to this virus? You can’t spin your way out of double-digit unemployment.”But while Trump’s unorthodox approach seems fraught with risk his detractors sense that there is a chance it works. It’s not just because he’s constructed a universe in which he will pass off any blame (if not China for failing to contain the virus than Obama for not leaving him with the exact right bureaucratic infrastructure to handle it; or the media for over-hyping it; or Democratic governors for keeping their states locked down because of it). It’s also because he is giving the public something it craves—which is hope. Indeed Trump has been fairly explicit about this being the primary motivation behind his happy talk. The infamous exchange he had with NBC’s Peter Alexander over what message he’d send to frightened Americans is remembered for the fact that he petulantly responded by calling Alexander a “terrible reporter.” The more illuminating comment however came moments later. “I think it’s a very bad signal that you are putting out to the American people” Trump said. “They’re looking for answers and they’re looking for hope.”The president’s ability to keep Americans hopeful is limited of course. Three million Americans filed for unemployment insurance this week. Upwards of 40 percent of the country believes the president has done a bad job managing coronavirus. And epidemiologists and medical experts warn that his desire to loosen public health measures will only prolong the crisis and in turn make the economic damage far worse. Can hope withstand that? Perhaps not. But that in Trump’s mind is a question and set of accompanying problems that he will tackle on another day. “The difference with Trump at least in this case is he is really looking ahead just one day. He wants to program the next episode of the TV show. And so I think he is going back to what works for him: you blame foreigners you blame elites and experts who are out to get him who don’t know what he knows and make it a partisan issue” said Ken Baer a longtime Democratic operative who worked for Obama during the 2010 cycle. “I think his bet is it will make him popular and get him through the next couple weeks. The question is: What’s the reality? And will it work when you have real pain?”
372,Trump: I Don’t Think Governors ‘Need’ the Medical Equipment They’re Begging For,Justin Baragona,The Daily Beast,-2,https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-i-dont-think-governors-need-the-medical-equipment-theyre-begging-for?ref=author,As medical professionals and local authorities across the country sound the alarm over shortages of life-saving equipment due to a surge in coronavirus patients President Donald Trump on Thursday shrugged off their warnings because as he put it “a lot of equipment is being asked for that I don’t think they will need.” Calling into Fox News host and unofficial presidential adviser Sean Hannity’s show on Thursday Trump boasted about his administration’s response to the crippling pandemic despite the fact that the United States now has the most confirmed coronavirus cases in the world.Asked by Hannity about his general refusal to enforce the Defense Production Act to ramp up production of needed supplies like masks and ventilators the president insisted it hadn’t been necessary because there’s been “tremendous spirit” from corporations that he says have stepped up. This prompted him to then take some pointed shots at Democratic governors who’ve criticized the federal response.“Remember we are a second line of attack” he exclaimed. “The first line of attack is supposed to be the hospitals and the local government and the states.”The president first took aim at Washington Gov. Jay Inslee calling him a “failed presidential candidate” who is “always complaining” and “should be doing more” for his state. He then proceeded to attack Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer who he said was “not stepping up” and “has not been pleasant.”Claiming he gets along well with most of the other governors the president then suggested they are asking for unnecessary supplies from the federal government while also insisting that the states should take on the majority of the burden.“I think that a lot of things are being said that are more” Trump said. “I don’t think certain things will materialize a lot of equipment is being asked for that I don’t think they’ll need.”“But we are building four medical centers and many other things we have developed and sent thousands of ventilators and hopefully they’re going to do well but you have to know this has to be managed by local government and by the governors” Trump added. “Can’t be managed by the federal government.”Hannity who began his program by blasting New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for desperately declaring his state’s need for 30000 ventilators went on to say the governor’s request annoyed him. Moments later Trump suggested the state didn’t need nearly that much equipment.“I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they are going to be” he asserted. “I don’t believe you need 40000 or 30000 ventilators. You know you go to major hospitals sometimes they have two ventilators. ”As of publication the death toll from COVID-19 in New York City alone has topped 365. The city’s entire health-care system meanwhile is on the brink as more and more patients flood the hospitals. At its current pace FEMA estimates that the city’s intensive care units will be filled by Friday.
373,Trump Rejects New York’s Plea For Ventilators: ‘I Don’t Believe You Need’ That Many,Nick Visser,The Huffington Post,-2,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/trump-coronavirus-ventilators-new-york-state_n_5e7d651cc5b6256a7a27c911,President Donald Trump rejected calls from New York’s governor that the state needed tens of thousands of new ventilators to treat a mass of patients infected with the novel coronavirus saying he didn’t believe those numbers were accurate.“I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they’re going to be” Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Thursday night. “I don’t believe you need 40000 or 30000 ventilators. You know you go into major hospitals sometimes they’ll have two ventilators. And now all of a sudden they’re saying can we order 30000 ventilators?”He added: “Look it’s a very bad situation. We haven’t seen anything like it but the end result is we’ve got to get back to work and I think we can start by opening up certain parts of the country.”The president’s statements came as public health officials declared the United States the leading country in terms of coronavirus cases with more than 81300 infected. More than 1000 people have been killed by the virus many in New York which has the worst outbreak in the nation.New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) warned Thursday that the state’s hospitals could soon be overwhelmed with patients afflicted with the COVID-19 disease noting more than 5200 people had been hospitalized including 1290 in intensive care.On Tuesday Cuomo said the Federal Emergency Management Agency was sending 400 ventilators after he warned that the state needed thousands more to deal with an impending “apex” of its infection rate that he estimated would take place in a few weeks.“What am I going to do with 400 ventilators when I need 30000?” Cuomo said at a news conference at Manhattan’s Javits Center which is being turned into a makeshift hospital to treat New Yorkers. “You want a pat on the back for sending 400 ventilators? You’re missing the magnitude of the problem.”Trump later said 4000 additional ventilators would be sent to New York’s hospital system but he blasted the governor’s leadership saying he had a chance to buy the machines in 2015 but “turned it down.” Cuomo has ordered that 7000 more be purchased but warned it’s still not nearly enough. The state approved a plan to allow two patients to share one ventilator if needed as infections grow more dire.The president has been insistent that the country can soon “open up” after many states have urged residents to self-isolate and socially distance in their communities to halt the spread of the virus. He’s pushed the Easter holiday weekend as his deadline despite warnings from health officials that doing so could spell disaster.“I think we can open up sections quadrants keep them going until the whole country’s opened up” Trump told Hannity on Thursday. “The people want to get back to work. They want to get back.”

However he said this week that federal aid will only flow to states that “treat us well.”“It’s a two-way street” he said on Fox News on Tuesday.Trump told Hannity on Thursday that Whitmer has “not been pleasant” and said “all she does is sit there and blame the federal government.”Whitmer went on Twitter to set the record straight: Hi my name is Gretchen Whitmer and that governor is me I've asked repeatedly and respectfully for help. We need it. No more political attacks just PPEs ventilators N95 masks test kits. You said you stand with Michigan — prove it. Trump says he's having a big problem with ""the young a woman governor you know who I'm talking about from Michigan.                                  ""She added that she gets along well with Vice President Mike Pence who is leading Trump’s coronavirus responsePS: I’m happy to work with the VP! We get along well."

Now you might look at them as an aberration or whatever. But they matter to those people because you know what? They don’t have jobs.”“Tone is everything and I think that’s a very dismissive condescending just a dumbass tone” Cavuto added.Fox Business correspondent Charlie Gasparino agreed. “I mean it is just horrible” he said.“You’ve got to choose your words very carefully” Cavuto later said. “They are human beings who are desperately looking for something.”

There have been 530000 cases and 24000 deaths worldwide.The term “kung flu” gained traction last week after CBS reporter Weijia Jiang alleged that a White House staffer had used it to describe the coronavirus.Meanwhile the president himself has garnered widespread criticism for repeatedly calling it the “Chinese virus” against the World Health Organization’s advice to avoid using geographic descriptors to prevent stigmatization.POTUS has since said he won’t use the term in the future.Trump Jr. has previously shared strange memes of his father with a man bun as Baby Yoda from “The Mandalorian” and as a thumbnail on Pornhub’s website

Mayor Eric Garcetti Has A Grim Prediction Of What Coronavirus Will Do Next,Ed Mazza,The Huffington Post,-2,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/eric-garcetti-coronavirus-prediction_n_5e7d8e31c5b6256a7a280806,Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti issued a chilling warning about the toll the coronavirus pandemic is likely to take take on his city and others around the country.Garcetti called the projections “horrifying” and said they were keeping leaders awake at night.  “Will we have hundreds of thousands of deaths or tens of thousands of deaths? That’s what keeps us up” he told Business Insider. “These are people who all know who each one of us will know. It’ll be our friends it’ll be our family it’ll be people whom we love dearly.”He said the stay-at-home orders in L.A. won’t be lifted by Easter as President Donald Trump has said but will last at least two months ― and he warned against false optimism. “Giving people false hope will crush their spirits and will kill more people” the mayor said. “Will crush their spirits will revert their actions and will kill more people.”Garcetti also said Thursday in a news conference that Los Angeles could soon see enough cases to rival New York City which is now the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States with more than 23000 confirmed cases and 365 deaths.Garcetti called the footage of overwhelmed hospitals from New York “the most haunting images any leader could see and it’s difficult for me to imagine that it won’t happen here.” And he said the problem won’t be limited to New York and Los Angeles.“There is no place in America that will not be overwhelmed in terms of the number of patients who need ICU and other hospital beds and how many we have in this country” he said. “There is no place that won’t be overwhelmed by needing more ventilators and not having enough.”Governors and public health officials around the country have said they need thousands of ventilators for coronavirus patients. Trump said Thursday that he didn’t believe the numbers. “You know you go into major hospitals sometimes they’ll have two ventilators” he said. “And now all of a sudden they’re saying can we order 30000 ventilators?”Trump’s comments came hours after the United States surpassed China to become the country with most coronavirus cases. There have been more than 82000 confirmed infections and more than 1000 deaths attributed to the virus.

379,Single Republican Pointlessly Forcing In-Person Vote On House Coronavirus Bill,Arthur Delaney Travis Waldron and Tara Golshan,The Huffington Post,-2,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/house-coronavirus-vote-massie-delay_n_5e7dfc0ec5b6cb9dc19e9b22,A Kentucky Republican is single-handedly forcing House lawmakers to travel to Washington for a roll call vote on coronavirus relief legislation.Rep. Thomas Massie who has said the government’s response to the pandemic is worse than the pandemic itself refused to go along with a so-called voice vote that would not require members to be present in the House chamber. House rules allow for a single member to object to a “voice vote” procedure and cause delay.Massie announced his decision Friday in a tweet after lawmakers had already started making their way back to Washington because the congressman had already indicated he’d likely insist on them being present for the vote. The final outcome is not in doubt. The bill will pass either way ― it’s just a matter of when and whether hundreds of lawmakers need to board planes to return to the Capitol.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Thursday a private call with lawmakers that she was determined to hold the vote Friday if she could get enough lawmakers back to Washington.“We have to get people off their selfishness” Pelosi said on the call of the Republican threat to hold up the vote according to Politico. Pelosi’s office said it would be prepared to call lawmakers back to D.C. should Massie or another lawmaker disrupt the expedited proceedings. The House would then need to reach quorum — 216 members — to proceed.Massie is the only House member who wants the roll call vote a Pelosi spokesman told HuffPost. President Donald Trump censured Massie over Twitter on Friday morning calling the Kentucky Republican a “third rate Grandstander.”The Senate passed the relief package this week. The bill would send more than $1000 in direct cash payments to all but the wealthiest tier of American households supercharge unemployment insurance and give businesses tax breaks if they avoid laying off their workers. It also bails out airlines and includes an additional corporate bailout fund the Trump administration can use at its discretion which has been controversial.Unemployment claims have already skyrocketed as local governments have ordered businesses to close in order to reduce the spread of the coronavirus which is present in every state and has already killed more than 1000 Americans. But Massie a libertarian has said he thinks closing restaurants and other government actions are actually a bigger threat than the virus itself.“The greater harm to society is the public’s unquestioning acceptance of the unchecked authority of governments to force private behavior and disrupt economies” he tweeted last week adding that the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II would seem like a “light touch” by comparison. This week Massie followed up that tweet: “Social-distancing self-isolation and shelter-in-place go from good ideas to oppression when ordered from the barrel of a gun” later adding that he was “struggling” with whether to hold up the vote.Lawmakers reportedly spent Thursday frantically trying to find flights back to Washington. An added worry for lawmakers: getting sick en route. “It’s unfortunate that one single member would choose to endanger the health and safety of not only an entire legislative body and its support staff but also all of the communities to which these members will now return after convening in Washington” said Chris Schuler a spokesperson for Rep. John Yarmuth (D-Ky.). “It’s particularly egregious because this legislation will pass with overwhelmingly bipartisan support whether by voice or recorded vote.”The Capitol Building has already seen multiple positive cases of COVID-19 including at least two House lawmakers — Reps. Ben McAdams (D-Utah) and Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) who are currently quarantined at home. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) also tested positive for the coronavirus.Ahead of the vote Friday lawmakers sat several seats apart during one-minute speeches which were overwhelmingly supportive of the legislation. A spokesman for Massie did not have further comment at time of publication.

It is staggering in its breadth and scope in its incompetence.”“The president did not cause this virus to develop” Redlener acknowledged. But he blamed Trump “for leading the country in the wrong direction with misinformation that has been extremely destructive to our efforts to combat this calamity that we have on our doorstep.”

He said he would be self-isolating and working from home until Thursday.“The symptoms so far have been very mild so I’ve been able to carry on with the work driving forward the UK response” Hancock said.Downing Street said earlier this week that British Foreign Secretary Dominic Rabb would lead the government if Johnson contracted the virus and became too sick to fulfill his duties.It was unclear whether Johnson’s fiancee Carrie Symonds who is several months pregnant is remaining in the official residence with Johnson.Johnson and his government have been criticized for their initial handling of the public health crisis facing accusations that they were not taking the threat seriously.On March 3 Johnson boasted about shaking hands with everybody during a visit to a hospital in which “there were a few coronavirus patients.”As the number of cases in the U.K. and world continued to rise however Johnson struck a more somber tone describing the pandemic as “the worst public health crisis in a generation.”Following mounting pressure Johnson on Monday finally ordered a nationwide three-week lockdown.“From this evening I must give the British people a very simple instruction – you must stay at home” he said in a broadcast on the BBC.“If you don’t follow the rules the police will have the powers to enforce them including through fines and dispersing gatherings” Johnson warned. “The way ahead is hard and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost.”Prince Charles the heir to the British throne was confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus earlier this week. Following Charles’ diagnosis Buckingham Palace announced that Queen Elizabeth II “remains in good health.”Palace sources said the queen last saw Johnson on March 11. The queen on Wednesday conducted her weekly audience with Johnson via telephone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The U.K. has confirmed nearly 12000 cases of COVID-19 and 580 deaths.

383,Trump Invokes Production Law Ordering GM to Build Ventilators,John Harney,Bloomberg,0,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/trump-invokes-production-act-compelling-gm-to-make-ventilators?srnd=politics-vp,President Donald Trump on Friday ordered General Motors Co. to make ventilators for coronavirus patients invoking a federal law that gives him vast powers over industry in crises just as the company is within weeks of starting production on the equipment.Trump said in a statement that he had signed a memorandum “directing the secretary of Health and Human Services to use any and all authority available under the Defense Production Act to require General Motors to accept perform and prioritize federal contracts for ventilators.”GM has already been moving to manufacture ventilators at some of its factories in partnership with Ventec Life Systems Inc. and both companies were caught off guard by Trump’s move and skeptical it would change their plan. Trump said at a news conference later that he might reconsider the order if GM could agree to a deal. “I think we might be able to pull it” he said.Still the decision to single out a company under the Defense Production Act marked an important shift for Trump who until Friday had spoken glowingly of the government’s partnership with private companies to ramp up production of medical equipment. He also announced the appointment of White House trade adviser Peter Navarro to coordinate actions under the act and issued an executive order authorizing the government to guarantee extend loans and commit to purchases that increase the nation’s manufacturing capabilities.“This invocation of the DPA should demonstrate clearly to all that we will not hesitate to use the full authority of the federal government to combat this crisis” Trump said Friday. He praised other companies including Ford Motor Co. and General Electric Co. for their efforts and announced a new initiative by Boeing Co. to make face shields.The president issued an executive order last week laying groundwork for him to invoke the DPA but since then he has expressed reluctance to use its powers. He has repeatedly said manufacturers had volunteered to produce coronavirus materials.But on Friday his patience appeared to have run out with GM. He assailed the company and its chief executive officer Mary Barra in a series of tweets in which he accused the firm of moving slowly and demanding too high a price for its ventilators.It wasn’t clear what prompted the tweets which took the company by surprise according to people familiar with the matter.“Our negotiations with GM regarding its ability to supply ventilators have been productive but our fight against the virus is too urgent to allow the give-and-take of the contracting process to continue to run its normal course” Trump said in the statement. “GM was wasting time.”Just hours before his tweets Trump said in an interview on Fox News that companies -- including GM -- were responding appropriately to the coronavirus outbreak.A little more than an hour after Trump’s first tweet GM and Ventec announced they would build ventilators at the automaker’s parts plant in Kokomo Indiana where they’ve been working around-the-clock for a week to convert it into a medical-device facility.The use of the DPA doesn’t change the plan for manufacturing ventilators Ventec CEO Chris Brooks said in an interview. The White House’s action might streamline where all the ventilator orders go perhaps sending them to one centralized distribution center for the federal government to manage and triage based on need he said. But there’s a lot still unknown about how the use of the DPA will affect the partnership with GM he said.By having the federal government handle that distribution aspect it allows Ventec to do what we do and that’s make ventilators Brooks said.The president’s action may simply allow the government to more quickly take orders from GM and others. The automaker can still sell its production to the federal government if asked said a person familiar with the matter. GM had planned to start production in April regardless of whether there was a federal contract in place the person said.Democrats including former Vice President Joe Biden Trump’s likely opponent in the November election had urged Trump to invoke the DPA earlier. Many U.S. governors have complained they’re unable to obtain sufficient supplies of ventilators respirator masks and even basic medical supplies like gloves and gowns.“That’s really good news” Biden said Friday after Trump’s statement. “Now we were suggesting to do that over a month ago. But the point is he’s done it and I congratulate him for it.”
384,Even in Crisis Union Priorities Win,STEVEN GREENHUT,The American Specator,2,https://spectator.org/even-in-crisis-union-priorities-win/,SacramentoWith coronavirus turning our lives into a zombie apocalypse most Americans have been fairly nonchalant as government officials grab the most expansive power that they can get their hands on. For instance California Gov. Gavin Newsom has claimed the authority to commandeer private hotels to house homeless people while various governors have threatened to impose martial law — even though there are no signs of broad social unrest.Leftist writers have declared that the coronavirus situation — and I do agree that it’s a very serious situation — disproves the central point about libertarianism and any other philosophy that is concerned about keeping government limited. I just don’t see it. All the crisis has done is give public officials from both parties the rationale to do whatever it is they want. Have you looked at the garbage the Democrats have tried to cram into the bailout bill?In California the newly passed Assembly Bill 5 had been causing hardship before the coronavirus pandemic hit our shores and now it’s only compounding people’s ability to deal with it.From what I see the government seems incompetent and craven. The marketplace is what’s keeping food on our shelves gasoline at the pumps and hospitals functioning as well as they are despite everything. If anything this bizarre state of affairs provides a little insight into what life would be like if the state more directly controlled the economy. I’m not sure why more Americans don’t understand the deprivation that would result and why more of them don’t share my limited-government views.But there are some things state and federal officials can do to help ameliorate all the current pain and suffering. Most of these things not surprisingly revolve around reducing the rules that impede a properly functioning market. For instance state occupational-licensing rules keep doctors and nurses from crossing state lines to provide care. The Food and Drug Administration’s bureaucracy slows the development of needed drugs.In California the newly passed Assembly Bill 5 had been causing hardship before the coronavirus pandemic hit our shores and now it’s only compounding people’s ability to deal with it. That union-created legislation has banned many companies from using freelance and contractor labor. It was designed to force Uber Lyft DoorDash and other app-based transportation companies to hire their drivers as permanent employees but it also has ensnared long-haul truck drivers writers photographers musicians umpires — you name it.Suspending AB 5 is crucial for three reasons. First California employees — like employees all over the country — are facing a vast rollback in their ability to earn a living. This is particularly harmful for lower-income workers who lack financial reserves to see them through a virtual government-mandated shutdown of the economy. People are being impoverished by the crisis yet Newsom refuses to relax rules that keep them from earning a living.Second we’re all supposed to be sheltering in place which means staying at home. So working at home is the only sensible option for most people. Most work-at-home opportunities are freelance so they essentially are illegal for workers in many industries here. By not suspending AB 5 Newsom is forcing people to leave their homes and interact in public in order to pay their bills. That’s not just counterproductive but also unconscionable — especially in the current crisis.Finally AB 5 impedes some of the industries we need most in our quarantined society. Truckers bring food (and toilet paper) from across the country although a federal court has fortunately (although temporarily) halted AB 5’s enforcement for interstate truckers. Delivery services bring groceries and restaurant food to our door so that we don’t need to go to grocery stores and chance the spreading contagion. This law limits such services.Californians increasingly understand the impact of the law as it constricts their family budget. They need to apply more pressure in the political system — and now is a good time to do that. For instance Assemblyman Tyler Diep a centrist Republican from central Orange County didn’t even make the top-two runoff after coming in third in the March 3 primary. Opponents of his “yes” vote on AB 5 had targeted him with a series of campaign mailers.Unfortunately it’s harder to make the state’s Democrats pay for their continued support for a law that was supposed to force companies to hire freelancers as permanent employees but has led to predictable layoffs instead. It’s too bad because AB 5 really is an impediment to the ability of Californians to deal with the coronavirus outbreak.Instead the governor continues to push increasingly “out there” measures that give government more power but refuses to take the simple and obvious step of halting a government mandate that is forcing people to leave their homes limiting trucking and delivery operations and leaving Californians unable to earn some cash while stuck largely at home.It’s not hard to understand why AB 5 has become sacrosanct. Newsom and his Democratic colleagues are beholden to the state’s unions. But you’d think they could put the general good above their narrow interests — at least during the most troublesome times.
385,Coronavirus Quarantine and the Grim Mathematics of ‘War’,LARRY ALEX TAUNTON,The American Specator,2,https://spectator.org/coronavirus-quarantine-and-the-grim-mathematics-of-war/,Last night I returned from Spain. Along with Italy it is the so-called epicenter of the coronavirus in Europe. Worse the last six weeks have also seen me in Britain Portugal France and all over North Africa as if I were on a tour of coronavirus-infected regions. And in a sense I was.Escaping that continent was no easy thing. Flights were continually canceled and rerouted to hubs where coronavirus testing could be conducted. Airports were ghost towns and planes were largely empty. Upon arrival in Miami passengers were taken off the plane in groups of 25 for evaluation. But once out of the airport America looked much as it does on say Christmas Day — stores were closed and roadways were empty but it was not transformed by virus pandemic panic and regulation.Let me explain.I have been in Europe since the beginning of this pandemic and my sense is that even now Americans don’t really understand the degree of disruption that is coming to their lives and to society as a whole. As I sat writing yesterday at the hotel bar in Miami — however it may appear I swear that I did not write this while intoxicated — I looked out and saw a lot of people walking jogging cycling and driving in their cars. It was slightly jarring given what things look like in Europe. Then this morning I read that 100 million Americans are living under stay-at-home orders. This too is somewhat jarring.The major cities of Southern Europe are in panic mode. In Spain the country is practically under martial law. The crackdown came very gradually almost friendly. A soft encouragement to stay indoors. Spanish police said nothing when they saw you on the streets. Most people didn’t go out. But you still saw some joggers and beachgoers.Then police vans equipped with loudspeakers drove slowly through the streets telling people to stay inside unless they had an approved reason to do otherwise. (Here’s a view from my room.)A few days later the military came in and police became somewhat belligerent — even when you had a legal reason for being out — and huge fines were levied on violators. What has been going on in Europe for weeks is just starting to hit major cities in the United States and it will almost certainly get much worse.My point isn’t that governments shouldn’t enforce quarantines or that you shouldn’t observe them. Listen to your authorities and medical experts. My concern rather is that mass quarantine is introducing problems it seems few have considered. The societal ramifications are only now starting to reveal themselves in Europe. There I witnessed an incremental loss of civil discourse and respect for civil liberties with neighbor ratting out neighbor. This is an old pastime in France and Spain dating back to the Spanish Civil War and World War II where neighbors turned each other in as collaborators opposition loyalists or for hiding Jews. That penchant for spying on one another is revealing itself again as people at home all day with nothing to do watch each other and report outings or gatherings they deem to violate the quarantine. It is ugly.And all of it started happening in just two weeks.What will things look like in two months? Six months? A year? Mass quarantine is unleashing societal problems that are likely to compound exponentially the suffering inflicted by the virus itself. And this is to say nothing of the toll quarantine will take on marriages families household economies mental health and things none of us have yet considered. I assure you that it will be beyond what we can imagine because there has never been anything like this before.Is it too much to think that it will lead to the breakdown of the fragile concept of what we call “civilization”? I don’t think so. Once uncorked this is not a genie that will be easily put back into the bottle.Much of this is of course being driven by media hysteria. Media prefers hysteria. It sells. But there are other usually sensible people who are contributing to the hysteria too. Peggy Noonan — Peggy Noonan! — of all people wrote a column saying that telling people to remain calm was not helpful. In so doing she essentially told people not to remain calm. Then there is New York magazine’s latest cover which crossing out the word “DON’T” declares “PANIC.”Pundits are allowing their own fears to pollute their commentary. To take even a moderate tone on coronavirus is to invite fierce attacks. In North Africa as much as a month ago I encountered those who were terrified of contracting coronavirus. Considering the myriad hideous ways a man can die in Africa — 435000 die each year of malaria alone — this seemed the least of our worries. But such is the power of 24/7 media coverage where even the Bedouins carried cell phones.As I sat in Spanish quarantine I read that Trump had called himself “a wartime president.” However much his critics might have found this distasteful I think it is accurate. It is also an indication that he well understands the gravity of what is before us as a nation. He will have to make decisions that are characteristic of wartime presidents. Short of a miracle — a vaccine is rapidly developed mass-produced and distributed; the virus dies in the warm summer sun; or God Almighty intervenes — President Trump will be faced with decisions of seismic implications. As the economic carnage takes its toll he (and other world leaders) must consider the grim mathematics of a virus with a mortality rate of roughly 1.5 percent or plunging America into the realm of Mad Max.During the Blitz the Luftwaffe’s bombing campaign to bring Britain to its knees in 1940–41 Churchill and the British people faced equally dreadful options: surrender to Hitler or evacuate children to the countryside brave the bombs and fight on knowing that people would die. History shows that they fought on.This is what wartime decisions look like.The choice it seems will ultimately be to remain quarantined indefinitely and accept social economic and political Armageddon or to take extraordinary steps to protect the vulnerable and get back to work knowing that many will in fact die. President Trump knows this. He is already more than hinting at it.I see no third option.But I believe that we have the finest health-care system in the world.I believe that America is the greatest nation on earth.I believe that this will be demonstrated in the days weeks and months to come.I believe this will be our finest hour.
386,Getting Smart With the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,SCOTT MCKAY,The American Specator,2,https://spectator.org/getting-smart-with-the-strategic-petroleum-reserve/,ith all of the Wuhan coronavirus panic monopolizing the news in the past week something that has the potential to be a truly earth-shaking geopolitical event was largely missed.President Trump announced Friday that he was ordering the Department of Energy to buy up some 77 million barrels of oil to fill the Strategic Petroleum Reserve the massive store of crude oil the federal government has stashed in salt caverns along the Gulf Coast. The SPR’s capacity sits somewhere in the neighborhood of 713.5 million barrels; currently it holds about 635 million barrels after Congress demanded last year that oil be sold off from the SPR. The Department of Energy has the ability to store some 225000 barrels a day of production. It’s been estimated that the effect of this buy-up could be to absorb some 430000 barrels a day of demand. That’s the equivalent of someone opening a large oil refinery and putting production through it.The announcement briefly halted an absolute slaughter in the oil markets which began when Saudi Arabia announced it was ramping up oil production following a breakdown of talks between the Saudis and Russians over production levels. The Saudi-led price war which they’re blaming on the Russians functions as a direct assault on American shale-oil producers who are some of the most innovative technologically advanced and efficient operators in the energy sector.Trump is the first American president to look at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve the way a businessman would.The problem with domestic shale oil is it costs more to produce than Saudi or Russian oil does though shale producers have worked near-miracles in finding ways to get oil out of the ground at lower and lower costs. The Saudis have seen this having tried during the Obama administration to drive the price down and wipe out the Americans. They tried and failed and now they’re trying harder. In late 2015 the last time this price-war business was tried there was about 360 million barrels’ worth of excess production. With the current Saudi–Russian assault on the markets that number has been estimated to grow closer to 800 million barrels. Add the Wuhan coronavirus panic to the mix and nobody really knows just how much excess production vis-à-vis global demand there might be. One extreme forecast indicates as much as 12 million barrels per day – almost 15 percent of global production – would exceed demand as the coronavirus strangles the world economy.But something is different now than it was a few years ago. There’s someone who understands business in the White House this time and this situation falls well within his skill set.Trump is the first American president to look at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve the way a businessman would. Friday’s announcement should be the first in a series of actions that puts the United States in control of the global oil market and manipulates it to the advantage of both American consumers and the energy industry.Look we’re all for free markets here. A free market in oil is a dream we should all share. But there hasn’t been a free market in oil in decades assuming there ever was.The free market in oil such as it was disappeared in 1973 with the Arab oil embargo. It was then that no intelligent observer of that market could see it as anything other than a cartel market dominated by state actors most of whom operate daily in bad faith.That includes the Saudis and Russians obviously but the other members of OPEC are just as guilty.You think of American oil companies as Big Oil. They aren’t. They’re Medium Oil. ExxonMobil isn’t even in the top five oil producers on earth. The real Big Oil is a collection of state-run oil companies controlled by the Mohammed bin Salmans Xi Jinpings and Vladimir Putins of the world. Those guys collude to fix the price of oil when they can. That’s the entire point of this current price war — the Russians wouldn’t agree to limit oil production and prop up oil prices because they want to put American shale producers out of business and the Saudis at the end of the day decided to join the Russians. They might sound like they’re feuding but both of them (and all the rest of the Star Wars cantina-scene characters controlling companies like Kuwait Petroleum Corporation the National Iranian Oil Company Petrobras Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and so forth) ultimately want exactly the same thing which is to get rid of as many American producers as possible.This is all coming after America took over the leadership in world oil production in 2018. This is geopolitics not market economics.Given those circumstances the position that a U.S. president has to take a laissez-faire attitude toward foreign manipulation of the oil markets isn’t very defensible. We have more than enough experience in the effects that manipulation can have in our own economy; shocks in oil prices are a primary reason for the “shale revolution” in domestic oil production in recent years to begin with. And maintaining that production capacity given all the bad actors out there — who would dearly love to knock the shale producers out of the game and then drive prices up over $100 a barrel to reap a windfall in money and political prestige — is a national security imperative.“The president’s move was sophisticated” said Amy Myers Jaffe director of the program on Energy Security and Climate Change at the Council on Foreign Relations to the Washington Examiner. “He is signaling to credit markets that he is thinking about shale companies but in a way that is not a social handout and sends a signal to our oil producing allies like Mexico that the president is cognizant of the instability created for countries from a disorderly oil market.”She added “The U.S. in effect is contributing a production cut because by putting the oil in the SPR we are taking it off the market. That is closest the U.S. can get to stabilize the market because the government can’t tell producers to stop producing.”Trump’s action Friday is a good indication he gets it. The problem is the SPR isn’t big enough to fully accomplish the strategic potential of the vision of which he gave evidence.A month ago Brent crude was trading at $57.67 per barrel. It had dropped to $34.36 by Monday March 9. Trump’s announcement propped up the price to $35.44 but since then prices have collapsed further. Tuesday Brent crude fell to $30.41 and as of this writing on Wednesday it was trading near $26. And West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude which usually goes for less than Brent is hovering around $20.Buying 77 million barrels of oil for the SPR isn’t enough. What’s needed is a bigger strategic reserve.Don’t be surprised if Trump tries to make more moves to expand the SPR’s capacity.Get a big enough reserve capacity — not 713.5 million barrels but three or four billion — and the federal government is in a good position to manipulate oil prices to American advantage using the SPR. It wouldn’t be totally out of line to think a Washington with enough vision and wisdom might actually be able to regulate crude prices to within a range that keeps foreign bad actors from successfully killing off domestic producers while at the same time maintaining a stable supply of oil at an affordable price.And if the Department of Energy is able to buy low and sell high they might turn a buck here and there for the American taxpayer. Buy 77 million barrels of WTI at $20 and sell it at $45 when all this craziness is over and you just made $1.93 billion.It would be easy and it wouldn’t be wrong to castigate previous American presidents for not recognizing the potential and the wisdom of using the SPR as a means of giving a safe harbor to oil markets and domestic production. But the fact is before a few years ago there wasn’t enough domestic production to justify the SPR as such a device. In 2014 U.S. oil production stood at around eight million barrels a day; it’s nearly 13 million now though with prices and the world economy as they are it’s quite possible a quarter to a third of that production could end up shut in waiting for demand to drive the price back up.Don’t be surprised if Trump tries to make more moves to expand the SPR’s capacity. There are lots of salt caverns out there that could be used to hold crude and it’s fairly cheap to convert them for that use. According to a Bloomberg report the entire SPR network of facilities cost just $5 billion. That could pay for itself several times over during the next few years if the Saudis and Russians keep trying and failing to kill American producers.And don’t be surprised either if you start hearing about Trump slapping tariffs on Saudi oil to protect domestic producers. He’d be well within his rights to do so given the predatory nature of this price war.Finally don’t be surprised to see pushback from the president’s attempts to stabilize the oil markets. There is word that Congress will attempt to block an appropriation for the purchase of those 77 million barrels of oil as there are Democrats who hate fossil fuels so much even something like this won’t meet with their approval. And should Trump impose tariffs on the Saudis you’re going to hear “Protectionism!” from lots of corners as though Mohammed bin Salman and Putin deserve to be treated like honest brokers in the free market.Let them howl. This is smart policy it’s good for the economy it likely makes the federal government money over the long haul and it potentially results in American control over the world oil markets on both the supply and demand side. It’s rare that the federal government has the opportunity and the means to do something smart but this might just be an example. And if we’re talking about this as a campaign issue in the fall with Joe Biden — who let’s not forget opposed the Alaskan oil pipeline as a young senator long before he became senile and lost his mind — opposing it then there’s real hope for us all.
387,Democrats Began Politicizing Trump’s Coronavirus Response Well Before Senate Gridlock,SCOTT WALTER,The American Specator,2,https://spectator.org/democrats-began-politicizing-trumps-coronavirus-response-well-before-senate-gridlock/,Monday was in many ways a defining moment for the country as a federal stimulus bill failed to pass a procedural vote that would allow the Senate to vote on the bill itself. The bill negotiated in bipartisan fashion over the weekend allotted $500 billion in loans to distressed companies and $75 billion for hospitals. But it did not — according to Democratic Party leaders — have enough in it about environmental regulations or other items on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s “wish list.” At the 11th hour Pelosi and her counterpart in the Senate Chuck Schumer squashed the bill their own caucus had negotiated in good faith in hopes of forcing passage of something that better fit their “vision.”But the squashing isn’t the worst part. The cynical politicization of the coronavirus crisis is. And it began a week or so before with the purchase of a huge ad campaign funded by left-leaning activist groups and aimed at convincing Americans that President Donald Trump had botched the national coronavirus response.That ad campaign — which set the stage for what’s happening right now in the Senate — isn’t even trying to distance itself from the overt politicization of a virus that has infected over 40000 Americans and killed just over 500 as of Monday. The campaign is helmed by PACRONYM a group the Capital Research Center discovered was linked to the $600 million network of leftist groups run by Arabella Advisors which is a for-profit consultancy that helped direct money to ACRONYM a sister group to PACRONYM. The PACRONYM ad campaign seeks as one observer put it to funnel “millions of dollars toward advertisements in key swing states with the intent of politicizing the Wuhan coronavirus crisis and blaming the pandemic on President Donald Trump.”Although PACRONYM isn’t the only game in town it does share a funding source with the other players. On the Thursday before the failed Senate vote a group called Protect Our Care announced it was creating a “coronavirus war room” run by former aides to Elizabeth Warren and Hillary Clinton to attack the Trump administration’s response. It’s no surprise that Protect Our Care is a pop-up group run by the Arabella Advisors network as a project of the Sixteen Thirty Fund which is Arabella’s in-house lobbying wing described by Politico as “an unprecedented gusher of secret money” boosting left-wing causes and Democratic campaigns.And there’s more. While PACRONYM already has its ads rolling a similar ad campaign is in the works from the liberal attack group American Bridge which was founded by Clinton stalwart David Brock and recently declared its allegiance to Joe Biden’s campaign. American Bridge has enjoyed hundreds of thousands of dollars in combined funding from Arabella’s Sixteen Thirty and New Venture funds.Then there’s a mysterious new kid on the block: Fellow Americans which appears to have only just entered the fray by posting an ad that repeats the debunked claim that Trump called the coronavirus a “hoax” (he didn’t). Fellow Americans is also run by a Hillary Clinton alum Hailey Arends but passes itself off as a group for disaffected Republicans who plan to vote against Trump in November — hence its anti-Trump ads on social media.As cynical as it sounds the politicization of the coronavirus response began a week before the Senate stimulus gridlock even as people were entering ICU units across the country and even as hospitals and health-care professionals were facing shortages of supplies. And the politicization effort had a clear vision of its own unrelated to anyone’s health: stopping Donald Trump from winning a second term and electing Democrats to the House.Analysis of this frightening time and how the administration reacted to it will dominate political discourse for the rest of the year. And if Democrat-led “dark money” groups have their way Americans will see a biased take on the issue on every device they own from now until November.
388,Creativity and Compassion Continue to Combat the Coronavirus,VERONIQUE DE RUGY,The American Specator,2,https://spectator.org/creativity-and-compassion-continue-to-combat-the-coronavirus/,It’s easy to feel depressed and scared these days. News about the impact and death toll of the new coronavirus COVID-19 is constant. Government responses have been chaotic ranging from near-indifference to suddenly shutting down the economy with politicians offering to pay for everything.Yet we shouldn’t lose sight of the exceptional vitality that the private sector is demonstrating during this mess. It will make a difference so cheer up!After what can only be described as a multilevel government failure that resulted in the United States having practically no coronavirus tests available for weeks after the onset of the pandemic the private sector ramped up its production so much that we’re now testing 65000 people every day. This number is bound to grow. The tests are a crucial component of making it through this crisis and they’ll become even more accurate and deliver results faster as innovators do what they do best when they’re unhindered by silly or contradictory government regulations.Singapore’s Veredus Laboratories for example said it will soon release “Lab-on-Chip” kits to test patients for three kinds of coronavirus within two hours. Four American startups had also launched at-home tests for COVID-19 until the Food and Drug Administration unwisely demanded they stop issuing or testing kits.There are many other remarkable developments. For instance only a few weeks after the beginning of this outbreak in the United States many pharmaceutical firms worked at lightning speed to develop a vaccine. Last week the first doses of an experimental COVID-19 vaccine were administered to a group of volunteers. Many companies are hard at work trying to come up with a cure. Whether it’s testing old medications to figure out if they can mitigate the virus’s effects or developing new drugs the private sector is going full speed ahead to help.Americans especially health-care professionals need face masks. Companies nationwide are shifting resources to produce more masks. The firm 3M for instance announced that it “ramped up to maximum production levels of N95 respirators and doubled our global output to a rate of more than 1.1 billion per year or nearly 100 million per month.” 3M Chairman and CEO Mike Roman added that “more than 500000 respirators are on the way from our South Dakota plant to two of the more critically impacted areas New York and Seattle with arrivals expected starting tomorrow. We are also ready to expedite additional shipments across the country.”What about companies that weren’t in the face mask business? A group of American apparel and textile companies like Fruit of the Loom and Hanesbrands came together almost overnight to create a medical face mask supply chain to help hospitals health-care workers and citizens battling the virus’s spread. Efforts like this abound.It gets even better. Researchers trying to understand where best to send supplies or how to mitigate outbreaks are now being helped by Facebook’s disease prevention maps which display population density demographics and travel patterns. As George Mason University’s Tyler Cowen also explains for Bloomberg “Skype and Zoom sessions will replace many a class and the textbook companies are stepping forward with electronic portals that present classroom materials interactive exercises and grade student answers.”Creativity and selflessness are on display everywhere. In Canada an anesthetist managed to turn one life-saving ventilator into nine. In Italy a company used its 3D printer to manufacture much-needed ventilator valves to be used in that country’s overwhelmed hospitals. These entrepreneurs then created another life-saving device. As they explain in the New York Times they modified “a snorkeling mask already on the market to create a ventilation-assisted mask for hospitals in need of additional equipment which was successful when the hospital tested it on a patient in need.”And where I live in Virginia a couple has been 3D-printing shields to protect N95 masks. The Washingtonian reports “For each request received the Filkos are covering shipping costs and sending four free masks to doctors nurses and other healthcare workers.”Companies are indeed stepping up to help those in need. Burger King is giving out two free kids’ meals to everyone who orders food through their app. U-Haul is providing one month of free storage for students displaced from their universities by the virus.So during these depressing times don’t underestimate human ingenuity. Just keep your eyes open and prepare to be amazed.
389,The Moralizing Cuomo Brothers,GEORGE NEUMAYR,The American Specator,2,https://spectator.org/the-moralizing-cuomo-brothers/,Turn on the TV these days and you are bound to catch one of the Cuomo brothers inveighing against the “selfish.” Chris Cuomo on CNN harangues any one who dares suggest that America restart its economy while Andrew Cuomo delivers lectures on the importance of staying home lest one expose the elderly to illness. Both brothers have inherited their father’s penchant for high and moralistic rhetoric. They have also inherited his incoherent moral philosophy.Mario Cuomo was given to flowery denunciations on many subjects but not abortion. There he would fall silent and simply say that he is “personally opposed” to it. His sons don’t even maintain that conceit. Andrew and Chris are both personally and publicly supportive of abortion.Recall Andrew’s comment that pro-lifers don’t even belong in New York: “Who are they? Are they these extreme conservatives who are right-to-life pro-assault-weapon and anti-gay? Is that who they are? Because if that’s who they are and they’re the extreme conservatives they have no place in the state of New York because that’s not who New Yorkers are.”Both Cuomo brothers have inherited their father’s penchant for high and moralistic rhetoric. They have also inherited his incoherent moral philosophy.Last year he signed into law the most liberal abortion law in the country. “Today we are taking a giant step forward in the hard-fought battle to ensure a woman’s right to make her own decisions about her own personal health including the ability to access an abortion” Cuomo said. “With the signing of this bill we are sending a clear message that whatever happens in Washington women in New York will always have the fundamental right to control their own body.”After passage of the law he ordered “I am directing that New York’s landmarks be lit in pink to celebrate this achievement and shine a bright light forward for the rest of the nation to follow.”Part of his justification for abortion rights is that women need them in order to have careers. In other words he is perfectly willing to sacrifice unborn children for the perceived economic good of women — a line of reasoning that he rejects in the case of the elderly. At a press conference this week he said he would not put the “elderly at risk” in order to “boost the economy.” He said “That’s not who we are.”Actually it is. New York is responsible for many of the abortions in America today.“My mother is not expendable and your mother is not expendable and our brothers and sisters are not expendable and we’re not going to accept a premise that human life is disposable and we’re not going to put a dollar figure on human life” Cuomo said this week. “You can do both but not in a clumsy ham-handed way. ‘Well we’ll just sacrifice old people; they’re old people anyway and the old get left behind.’ What is this? Some modern Darwinian theory of natural selection? You can’t keep up so the band is going to leave you behind? God forbid.”Cuomo would never extend this ethic of life to the unborn. He finds them highly “expendable.”It is hard to imagine the Democrats cheering Cuomo’s statement taking the same stance on the Terri Schiavos of the world. They found her expendable.Chris Cuomo the other night was pounding his chest about Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick suggesting that the elderly would be willing to “sacrifice” for the economy. Chris Cuomo was appalled by the suggestion and made comments in support of his brother’s stance. This is the same Chris Cuomo who wrote in Glamour magazine about the wonderfulness of abortion and said that men need to support reproductive rights as much as women do:So far in 2019 27 abortion bans have been enacted in 12 states. After Louisiana’s ban at six weeks’ gestation Missouri’s at eight weeks and Alabama’s near total ban I’ve seen the outpouring of action by women sharing their most personal stories and missing school and work to protest. But men have been largely silent.We can’t just sit on the sidelines while women work to protect reproductive rights. If men support a woman’s right to choose they need to get up and support it. I say that as a husband a man of faith and especially as a parent blessed with two daughters and a son.The fruit doesn’t fall far from the tree. Mario Cuomo were he alive today would be straddling the same contradiction as his sons making high-flown speeches about how “all lives matter” while denying protection to the most vulnerable lives of all.
390,A Plague of Democratic Partisanship,DAVID CATRON,The American Specator,2,https://spectator.org/a-plague-of-democratic-partisanship/,An overwhelming majority of Americans are worried about the financial effects of state and local measures imposed to slow the spread of COVID-19 yet the Democrats continue to dither over an economic stimulus bill. A new Harris poll reveals that 91 percent of Americans are “increasingly concerned” about the economy. Late Wednesday the Senate finally passed an emergency relief package but only after overcoming a threat by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders to put a hold on the bill. House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) says the lower chamber won’t take up the measure until Friday and the Democratic governor of New York has demanded additional allocations for his state before they pass it.Despite the prominent role played by Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) in hammering out the Senate bill New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on Wednesday that it would be terrible for his state: “I spoke to our House congressional delegation this morning I said to them ‘this doesn’t do it.’ I understand the Senate theory and the Republican theory but we need the House to make adjustments.” New York has been hard hit by coronavirus pursuant to the density of its population and Cuomo’s inability to convince the residents of New York City to take him seriously on social distancing. Cuomo scolded the city’s non-compliant residents last Sunday: “It is arrogant. It is self-destructive.”Sen. Sanders who is of course running for the Democratic presidential nomination threatened to put a hold on the bill if Republicans Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) Tim Scott (R-S.C.) Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and Rick Scott (R-Fla.) failed to support a provision in the bill that will pay some workers more in unemployment benefits than they would earn by working. As Graham put it “This proposal will make it hard for our employers to maintain their workforce particularly in the area of healthcare thus significantly delaying the economic recovery and impairing our health and safety.” Sanders ignored Graham’s point but released one of his trademark corporation-bashing statements Wednesday:In my view it would be an outrage to prevent working-class Americans to receive the emergency unemployment assistance included in this legislation. Unless these Republican Senators drop their objections I am prepared to put a hold on this bill until stronger conditions are imposed on the $500 billion corporate welfare fund to make sure that any corporation receiving financial assistance under this legislation does not lay off workers cut wages or benefits ship jobs overseas or pay poverty wages.All of this comes on the heels of a cynical Sunday maneuver by Senate Democrats who exploited the absence of five self-quarantined Republicans to block a procedural motion involving a bipartisan coronavirus rescue package. That bill had been hammered out over several days of negotiation — ostensibly in good faith — between Senate Democrats and Republicans. Yet on Saturday evening House Speaker Nancy Pelosi flew in from the coast and though she isn’t a member of the Senate by Sunday morning the deal was dead. This outraged the Senate Republicans who had worked on the bill. A telling measure of their anger was the response of moderate Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine):I cannot believe that the answer to this crisis — as we move to address the economic consequences that are so severe for the people of this country — that the answer from our friends on the other side of the aisle is delay delay delay. No sense of urgency. No hurry.… We don’t have another day. We don’t have another hour. We don’t have another minute to delay acting.… How can any of us want to see millions of Americans lose their paychecks their health insurance their contributions to their retirement plans?The answer of course is that that the Democrats decided to hold the legislation hostage until the GOP agreed to insert various provisions that have nothing to do with the purpose of the bill. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) provides a partial list: Corporate pay statistics by race for companies receiving assistance a bailout of all current postal service debt required early voting required same-day voter registration a $10000 bailout for student loans the use of official time for union collective bargaining full offset of airline emissions by 2025 greenhouse gas statistics for individual flights retirement plans for community newspaper employees $15 minimum wage at companies receiving assistance ad infinitum.It’s difficult to imagine anything more cynical than this partisan effort to exploit a pandemic that is not merely killing Americans but also destroying the economic foundation upon which the survivors depend for their livelihoods. While congressional Republicans and President Trump attempt to ameliorate both emergencies partisans attack them as former Vice President Joe Biden did three days ago. As indicated by the Harris poll noted above many Americans are worried about the economy as well as COVID-19 but Democrats see both as opportunities. We are in the grip of a partisan plague and politicians like Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer Bernie Sanders Andrew Cuomo and Joe Biden are the rats.
391,Planning Three Steps Ahead: On the Need and a Plan to Divorce From China,DOV FISCHER,The American Specator,2,https://spectator.org/planning-three-steps-ahead-on-the-need-and-a-plan-to-divorce-from-china/,Two caveats: One this article puts the cart well before the horse because we have not yet seen the worst of China Virus 19; yet this article focuses on the day after the crisis is declared over. After all Trump’s critics and all “Monday Morning Quarterbacks” always complain after the fact that others did not plan earlier. Two if President Trump is not reelected in November this article is pointless because our future relations with China will be the least of America’s problems. With that duly noted …China Virus 19 has brought home to more Americans than ever before that we absolutely have to divorce from China. We can agree to share custody of the kids holiday visitation arrangements even alimony. But the child support has to stop as soon as possible.We knew that Apple makes iPhones and so much else of their stuff there. So do all the other Silicon Valley high-tech behemoths. On the one hand they all are blazing Kaepernick-quality leftist Democrats. Their money goes solid Democrat. Their politics is so far to the left that they even violate free speech values to tilt towards Democrats. Twitter closes down mainstream conservatives and Republicans. YouTube bans Dennis Prager lectures on the “Ten Commandments” because Prager mentions such words as “murder” as in quoting “Thou Shalt Not Murder.” Diamond and Silk get expelled from the Facebook “community.” And yet these same flaming Silicon leftists flock to China to build all their products there because the labor can be had dirt-cheap and exploited shamelessly. A rabbi who mentored me 40 years ago taught me never to short-change quality employees because “when you pay peanuts you get monkeys.” We now understand that when you pay less than even that the poor suckers who assemble iPhones have to eat bats snakes and dogs.We all knew that we save a few bucks on every iPhone on every pair of Kaepernick-endorsed and LeBron-hustled Nikes we buy because these Left-Democrat companies all evade labor unions and the American worker to get dirt-cheap labor from bat-eaters. As Americans we all contributed with willing suspension of knowledge to this game. Along the way we became a country Made in China. One industry after another moved there to get away from mandatory union contracts and from paying for American-required “entitlements” so we could employ bat-eaters on the cheap. We thought we are safe forever so we can move even our aluminum factories to China our steel production almost our national security. We even moved our pharmaceuticals to China.Can you imagine? We the most powerful and wealthiest nation there ever has been are no longer self-sufficient in pharmaceuticals but rely on the single most heinous national security threat to our country to supply us with life-saving drugs. Did we realize that we even rely on them for large quantities of our hand cleansers and cough syrup? For shame my beloved country!Yet nothing changed our minds about giving China so much control over our lives and security. They hacked and raided our federal-employees databases and stole private data on millions of American federal workers. We didn’t care. They manipulate their currency and cheat on international trade and they get away with it because most Americans never studied economics and do not understand cannot even grasp what is being done to them.This is what currency manipulation is: learn it for yourself and teach it to all the genius economics graduates of our colleges who studied alongside Ocasio and who likewise think that Von Mises is the surname of Pixie and Dixie the ever-evasive targets of Jinx the Cat. Let’s say that one American widget costs 100 American dollars. Let’s say that one China Yuan Renminbi (“yuan”) is equal to one dollar. Let’s say that China also makes widgets and they sell for 100 yuan. So you have two equal products at an equal price. Now China devalues its yuan to 50 cents so that you get two yuan for each dollar. That means that the $100-dollar American widget now costs people on the Chinese mainland 200 yuan because they have to pay the American exporter in dollars. But they still can buy the local Chinese widget for 100 yuan. Which will they buy? Meanwhile they also export those widgets to America. They still want 100 yuan for each widget and they have manipulated their currency so that one dollar gives you two yuan. That means an American here can buy the Chinese widget for $50 (which will equal 100 yuan) or they can buy the American product for the $100 that the Americans charge in dollars. So by artificially manipulating and devaluing their currency’s value which is illegal under international trade law China increases its exports to America decreases American imports to China and blows open a huge annual $350 billion trade gap to our disadvantage.They are crooks. They are cheats. And they are a country without a G-d. Even the Soviet Union under its G-dless communism always had an active Russian Orthodox church below the surface and also Orthodox Russian Jews secretly baking matzos for Passover circumcising their boys and having rabbis solemnize their weddings. By contrast China is a theological wet market. So the Chinese cheat on currency. And we certainly know dozens of times over that they have been caught cheating on product quality. More than 20 million children’s toys made with lead were recalled in one situation while here in America lead has been banned in children’s toys since 1962. Also they’ve sold soy sauce made from human hair:When asking how the amino acid syrup (or powder) was generated the manufacturer replied that the powder was generated from human hair. Because the human hair was gathered from salon[s] barbershop[s] and hospitals around the country it was unhygienic and mixed with condoms used hospital cottons used menstrual cycle pad[s] used syringe[s] etc.Turbot fish farmed in waste water. Cabbage sprayed with formaldehyde. Fake green peas dyed with carcinogenic sodium metabisulfite. Tofu made with sewage and slop. Fake baby formula made in 141 factories that caused malnutrition swelled babies’ heads and led to massive numbers of deaths. In October 2013 cat meat slaughtered at a “black” slaughterhouse in Huai’an City near Shanghai was sold to butchers and local markets under the guise of “rabbit.” Gee how could COVID-19 and SARS and-and-and possibly have started in China? This is a G-dless country and we should have divorced years ago. The list of filthy-food incidents with China is huge. But we all wanted to save a buck on our iPhones on our underwear and on the toys we buy for birthdays and Christmas presents.We all have known all along that they cheat. They steal our intellectual property — over $200 billion worth of American business and technology secrets every year. They dumped cheap steel in England to drive British competitors out of the market. They dumped so much cheap steel into America that our industry had to lay off 13500 workers four years ago during Obama’s last year. Yet any of our businesses that want to operate there have to agree that China nationals get majority ownership. We all have gone along with this manifest evil to save a few bucks on batteries light bulbs and string lights.Not only have Democrats like Bill Clinton and Obama been weak-kneed door mats and easy marks but Republican presidents have been patsies too. Blinded by an ideological conservative economic devotion to “free trade” they have failed to see that “free trade” with China never has been free. Ronald Reagan set the pace for free-trade agreements based on a conservative belief that individuals are most efficient and productive when government and their taxes and tariffs get out of the way. All true. But conservative economists also warn “There ain’t no such thing as a free lunch.” And with China that lunch has lead in it. And waste and slop and human hairs that have come from dreck.If Rahm Emanuel famously and cynically has taught never to let a crisis go to waste this coronavirus economic social and epidemiological nightmare will offer the critical opportunity when it is over to run the “Dissomaster” and to divorce from China. We will never do it if we do not do it under Trump. If they are capable of walking and chewing gum at the same time Trump’s economic advisers need to start planning now. We have to get our manufacturing out of there — iPhones toy trucks and especially steel aluminum and pharmaceuticals. Trump saw that and has warned about it for decades. He is the first and only president who has had the guts to fight them to stare them down and even to stick to his guns as the great Wall Street gains he achieved during his first 18 months in office lost steam and reversed during the trade war and tariffs contest of 2018. Yet he did not back down and China blinked. Soon the stock market resumed its torrid rise even as unemployment virtually disappeared while wages rose ahead of inflation. It was tough. Americans found amid the tariffs that they had to pay more for steel and aluminum for toys and for some meds. Our nation’s great and noble farmers were challenged to stand bravely on the front lines. They gritted their teeth and we all did so. And China blinked.When — not “if” — we get past this coronavirus period Trump will have a very brief window to go full-court-press against China. Americans like all others forget soon enough. But we briefly will be of a mindset to bear anything to separate from depending on China. During the first phase of his trade and tariff war Trump may have single-handedly saved our aluminum and steel industries. How in the world could this country’s citizens have allowed ourselves to be bereft of home-based steel and aluminum factories just so that we could save money on outlet adaptors? If we face a future war with China or North Korea what were we going to fight the enemy with — Mattel toy airplanes painted with lead and “Sesame Street” Grover dolls? Trump saved those factories and brought manufacturing back to America not by bailing out incompetent and inefficient car companies that made bad products that Americans did not want but by leveling the playing field. President Trump’s tariffs have forced trade concessions from China but not nearly enough. After November he will have only four years left to win the trade war with China. And especially to get our aluminum steel and pharmaceuticals — all critical to national security — made here.We will never have another president as strong as Trump in our lifetimes. And for a brief moment in time Americans — fed up with coronavirus and quarantines and lost vacations and lost income and dead grandparents and ruined Easters and Passover seders — suddenly will see the economy rebound. Cash will start flowing again. We all will have a few more bucks to spend again and we will feel bountiful after the storm. If Trump plays it right and ambles towards the divorce for a brief snapshot in time Americans gladly will pay the extra dollar or two for their diapers and gift wrap and the extra 30 dollars for their iPhones and athletic shoes. Trump will have to lead from the bully pulpit and pressure and shame American corporations to diversify beyond China and to close down many of their factories there repatriating them to America or at least moving them somewhere else. Just as he has inspired millions to believe in a great America again the President will have a brief window to create a national consciousness that Americans with a conscience gladly pay the extra cost if any for products made just as cheaply outside of China. Thus for example if Nike is to remain invested in Colin Kaepernick and in China then at least half the country needs to be inspired to a consciousness that proud Americans do not wear Nike and should be ashamed to wear anything with that logo.Yes tomorrow and the day after we still will need to focus on coronavirus and on restarting our economy. But the day will come soon enough when that is behind us. We then will have a very narrow and fleeting moment — with cash flowing back into Americans’ pockets and with a nation ready to pay a bit extra for products not “Made in China” — to go full gangbusters and divorce. Better start planning now.
392,Life After ‘Sheltering in Place’?,LARRY THORNBERRY,The American Specator,2,https://spectator.org/life-after-sheltering-in-place/,Monday for the first time decision-makers even Gov. Cuomo of New Yawk began talking about the need to restart the economy. To return to the often-maligned American normal. Perhaps there’s a ray of light at the end of this doleful tunnel. I’m very glad to hear this.“We can’t keep the economy closed forever” Cuomo said demonstrating a firm grasp of the obvious. But before yesterday based on their statements decision-makers didn’t seem to be aware of this. They appeared to be competing with each other to see who could close the most and issue the most stringent “sheltering” orders. (My sources in Albany and Sacramento inform me that Cuomo and California Gov. Gavin Newsom were just before ordering the residents of their states not to inhale.) The Donald especially is clearly antsy to get going again. Witness his “back in business by Easter” remarks. So perhaps there is life after “shelter in place.” (Who came up with this clunky expression anyway? Doesn’t the Humane Society operate shelters for cats dogs and the odd ferret?)The numbers decision-makers have to work with are less than 100 percent complete and reliable. But what we do have strongly suggests the death rate of the virus is much lower here than in places like China Italy and Iran. China has about half the world’s cases and countries with a lot of traffic with China have another large chunk. Italy has the highest average age in Europe and most of the fatalities there are of people in their 80s and 90s. You’d like the death rate to be zero as that cold and clinical word “rate” translates into individual human beings most of whom were in no hurry to depart the planet even if they had left 90 in the rearview mirror. But alas the world is full of risks — I wonder how many people have drowned in home swimming pools this month — and we can’t completely shut down in order to avoid all of these. There’s an inherent risk in getting out of bed in the morning. I’m sure that during the same period last year more people died in traffic accidents than have died this year from the virus. But we weren’t ordered to stow our cars in our garages and stay home. (OK most garages are too full of junk to accommodate a car. But you get the idea.)I believe I’ve isolated a second silver lining in this draconian shutdown the first being that most schoolchildren have recently being spared the pernicious influence of their teachers. My wife and I are on the Tampa Police Department mailing list. Each week we get a rundown of the crimes committed in our patrol zone. This week the list of crimes is much shorter than usual. Apparently the local villains are sheltering in place rather than following their usual occupations. If the world goes back to work let’s not tell these guys.The TDS (Trump Derangement Syndrome) crowd has at least provided us a little mood-lightening comedy during the current troubles. This bunch has been hamming it up as usual accusing the Donald of being a xenophobic bigot for referring to coronavirus as “the Chinese virus” even though pandemics have historically been named after where they originated and there is no doubt this one started in and spread out from China. But I see an opportunity here that the Donald may just be ballsy enough to take advantage of. He could arrange a conference call with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and announce that he wishes to be free of the sin of xenophobia: “So henceforth and hereafter I will refer to this disease as the Big Apple Virus in the Eastern Time zone and the San Francisco Virus in the west.”Game. Set. Match.I don’t know what public health lessons we’ll learn from this agonizing experience. But I hope when the smoke clears most Americanos will have learned that the normal we enjoy here in the land of the buy-one-get-one-free and the home of the Atlanta Braves is pretty damn good.
393,From President Trump An Admirable Tweet,R. EMMETT TYRRELL JR.,The American Specator,2,https://spectator.org/from-president-trump-an-admirable-tweet/,WashingtonConservatives and libertarians around the country are becoming increasingly uneasy about what Washington is doing to our economy. Before the coronavirus struck many were anxious about the Swamp packing another $1 trillion of debt into our deficit. Now Washington is talking about spending close to $2 trillion to treat the coronavirus which would be one or trillion dollars that we do not have.At the president’s daily briefing one thing we never hear is concern about the staggering debt that we now have and the staggering debt our leaders are contemplating taking on. The Democrats showed restraint. They showed it for about 15 minutes last week and then began showing their really wanton lust for power. They claimed to be speaking for common citizens but in terms of responding to powerful interests they revealed that their palms were being greased by unions special interests and every outfit lobbying for the green revolution. I have seen proposals for unprecedented collective bargaining powers union representation on boards of directors increased fuel emissions standards for airlines and expansion of wind and solar tax credits.All supposedly to cure the coronavirus. The Democrats fear that they lost Crazy Bernie’s revolution in this election cycle. They seem to think they can win it now thanks to the coronavirus. Make no mistake about it. The package of goodies they have been suggesting from the Hill constitutes a revolution.Now perhaps the counter-revolution has begun and it is being led by Donald Trump. He tweeted late Sunday night that “We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.” And he went on “At the end of the 15-day period we will make a decision as to what way we want to go” (all caps in the original). My spies tell me the president has been listening to the right people in and around the White House. America is not a hospital ward. America is a vast country with the most successful economy ever. It is a capitalist economy. From time to time it is hit by unforeseen misfortunes. This time it was hit by an unforeseen virus but the economy must go on.The state we had arrived at by last weekend was explained cogently by Bob Luddy the CEO and founder of CaptiveAire in The American Spectator on Monday. He wrote “Our leaders are creating an economic crisis and a major national security risk with limited data. The cure is far worse than any perceived impact by COVID-19.” He urged that Americans be allowed to go back to work and there is reason to believe that his solution is viable. On Sunday the Los Angeles Times featured a story about the Nobel laureate Michael Levitt of Stanford University. He analyzed the cases of COVID-19 throughout the world. He correctly calculated that China would get through the worst of its coronavirus epidemic long before any health experts had predicted it would. His estimates on China’s eventual infected and dead were amazingly accurate.In an interview with the Times he cautioned “What we need is to control the panic.” He was almost insouciant about the virus saying “We’re going to be fine.” Is it possible to coax Professor Levitt to join President Trump for his daily press conference?What is more the president and the FDA commissioner announced late last week that the FDA had approved the “compassionate use” of an antimalarial drug chloroquine to treat patients infected with coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). It has been used since the 1940s to treat and prevent malaria and it as been used more recently to treat HIV and autoimmune disease. It began being used yesterday in New York City and Trump is optimistic about its effects. That is enough for me. Give it a try and that is not all. In France the infectious disease expert Didier Raoult has had success with two other treatments for COVID-19 Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. Professor Raoult’s results will take a while but we ought to have the results in on chloroquine very soon.Whatever the case we need not destroy our economy over this pandemic. Bob Luddy ended his piece with this hortatory coda: “I urge our President Trump to speak to Americans from a Midwest manufacturing plant away from the Swamp and appeal to all governors and Americans to overcome their fears take reasonable precautions but America must be open for business by March 30.”
394,Planned Parenthood Sues Texas Governor over Abortion Ban During Coronavirus Outbreak,DR. SUSAN BERRY,Breitbart,2,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/26/planned-parenthood-sues-texas-governor-over-abortion-ban-during-coronavirus-outbreak/,Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers are suing Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) over his ban on the procedure during the coronavirus pandemic in order to preserve medical supplies for healthcare personnel who are treating victims of the infection.“There are people in Texas who need an abortion today. Now” said Alexis McGill Johnson acting president and CEO of Planned Parenthood reported the Hill. “They cannot wait a delay of 30 days or even less.”The abortion providers are represented by the Center for Reproductive Rights and the Lawyering Project.“Abortion which is an essential time-sensitive medical service cannot be delayed” McGill Johnson said in a press statement. “A global pandemic is not some kind of opening to attack abortion. Gov. Abbott and anti-abortion activists nationwide are forcing a legal and political fight in the middle of a public health crisis.”However Dr. Christina Francis the chair of the board of the American Association of Prolife OB/GYNs (AAPLOG) says moving forward with abortions during the coronavirus pandemic is “medically irresponsible” at a time when medical equipment is much needed to treat those who are sick.“Abortions use up much-needed resources such as masks gloves and other personal protective equipment” Francis recently told LifeSiteNews.Francis’s organization is one of five groups of physicians that collectively represent over 30000 doctors and medical professionals who are condemning the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ (ACOG) representation of abortion as essential health care.The coalition of medical groups said in a statement:In such an uncertain and tumultuous time the entire healthcare profession is being called upon to conserve resources and healthcare professionals to an extent never seen before. And yet in the midst of this call while hospitals are postponing elective procedures and many outpatient clinics are rescheduling non-essential office visits the abortion industry continues with business as usual.Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton confirmed Monday Abbott’s order halting abortions during this time:“[A]ll licensed health care professionals and all licensed health care facilities shall postpone all surgeries and procedures that are not immediately medically necessary to correct a serious medical condition of or to preserve the life of a patient who without immediate performance of the surgery or procedure would be at risk for serious adverse medical consequences or death as determined by the patient’s physician.”This prohibition applies throughout the State and to all surgeries and procedures that are not immediately medically necessary including routine dermatological ophthalmological and dental procedures as well as most scheduled healthcare procedures that are not immediately medically necessary such as orthopedic surgeries or any type of abortion that is not medically necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.“We always knew the abortion industry really didn’t care about women’s health but this lawsuit proves it again” said Students for Life of America President Kristan Hawkins:Leaders in Texas and other states have called for abortion vendors to cease operations so that life-saving equipment can be used to address the coronavirus crisis. But as the rest of the country fights to save lives Planned Parenthood runs to court to end lives.Dr. James Dobson president of the James Dobson Family Institute praised Abbott and Gov. Mike DeWine (R) of Ohio for stopping abortions in the midst of the current crisis and called on other governors to do the same.“Our nation and our world are in the midst of a pandemic that is claiming thousands of lives and the U.S. is taking drastic measures to protect people during this unprecedented time” he added and he asked “So why are abortionists seeking to operate business as usual?”The coalition of physicians’ groups further states:Elective abortion is neither “essential” nor “urgent” but it does consume critical resources such as masks gloves and other personal protective equipment and unnecessarily exposes patients and physicians to pathogens.The doctors note that continuing abortions – some of which are likely to develop complications – place greater stress on a healthcare system that is under tremendous pressure at the current time:Most abortion providers instruct women to go to an emergency room if they have any concerning symptoms after the abortion. Approximately 5% of women who undergo medication abortions will require evaluation in an emergency room most commonly for hemorrhage. Surgical abortions can also result in hemorrhage. Emergency room personnel – who are already struggling to meet the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic – will be further strained to provide care to these women.
395,Dr. Deborah Birx Steers Away from Doomsday Coronavirus Predictions,CHARLIE SPIERING,Breitbart,2,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/26/dr-deborah-birx-steers-away-from-doomsday-coronavirus-predictions/#,Dr. Deborah Birx on Thursday provided encouraging coronavirus numbers suggesting that some of the predictive models were incorrect.“There’s no model right now no reality on the ground where we can see that 60-70 percent of Americans are going to get infected in the next 10-12 weeks” she said.Without specifically naming the Imperial College Brix referred to models that predicted there could be 500000 coronavirus deaths in the United Kingdom and 2.2 million deaths in the United States.The scientist of the model revised the estimate of deaths in the United Kingdom to be roughly 20000 people or fewer.Birx said that the actual data coming in from other countries were different than some of the direst projections.She noted that in major countries there was never an attack rate of over one in over 1000 people.“The predictions of the models don’t match the reality on the ground on either China South Korea or Italy” she said.Birx also addressed reports that raised the alarm of New York City hospitals running out of ICU beds ventilators and creating “Do Not Resuscitate” (DNR) policies for patients.She revealed that she spoke with health officials in New York that there were still ICU beds and 1000-2000 ventilators available and that there were no DNR policies enacted.“We don’t have evidence of that right now” she said.
396,Steph Curry to Dr. Fauci: When Can We Start Playing Sports Again?,WARNER TODD HUSTON,Breitbart,2,https://www.breitbart.com/sports/2020/03/26/steph-curry-dr-fauci-when-can-we-start-playing-sports-again/,On Thursday Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry spoke to Dr. Anthony Fauci the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease about the coronavirus and the return of sports.Curry interviewed Trump’s pandemic adviser in a 20-minute live Instagram event where he asked his own questions as well as those from fans watching the interview live.One of the most urgent questions on the minds of many basketball fans is when the league will be back on the court?“What you need to see is the trajectory curve starting to come down” Dr. Fauci said of the number of new cases.“We can start thinking about some degree of normality when the country as a whole has turned that corner and starts going down so you can pinpoint cases instead of getting overwhelmed like New York City” the doctor added.Curry also asked if all the quarantine efforts across the country were doing anything worthwhile to curb the virus. In particular Curry wanted to know if the sheltering in place orders were an overreaction?“This is serious business we are not overreacting” Fauci said
397,Texas Democratic Party Holding Online State Convention Due to Coronavirus,HANNAH BLEAU,Breitbart,2,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/26/texas-democratic-party-holding-online-state-convention-due-to-coronavirus/,The Texas Democrat Party will forgo its original plans for a traditional in-person state convention in San Antonio Texas and will instead hold the event online Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa announced on Thursday.“COVID-19 has impacted every facet of our lives. To keep people safe engage Texans everywhere and adapt to the challenges we face the 2020 Texas Democratic Convention will take place online” Hinojosa said in a statement.“Our tactics have changed but our goals for 2020 have not” he continued.Hinojosa is presenting the online convention which the press release described as the “largest online convention and virtual experience in Democratic Party history” as a breakthrough in terms of engagement as it will make it easier for individuals across the Lone Star state to participate:He continued:As the largest state convention in the country the Texas Democratic Party knows that we have an obligation to Texas Democrats everywhere to make this convention open to everyone. We view this as an opportunity to do something groundbreaking: by moving into a digital forum we will make it easier for individuals across Texas to participate by removing barriers associated with travel costs missed work or physical ability. We also have the opportunity to innovate our convention business. By designing these systems now we stay ahead of the curve and continue to be a leader among state parties who are operationalizing digital systems year over year. It will be the cutting edge of what technology has to offer and an example of how conventions are going to look in the future. I have the utmost confidence in our team’s ability to host this historic event.“Make no mistake there will be a Texas Democratic Convention and the Party’s business will be done” he continued noting that additional details are forthcoming.The announcement comes as Democratic National Committee (DNC) organizers engage in “intensive scenario-planning” in the event of the coronavirus pandemic preventing the July 13–16 gathering at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee Wisconsin.“There are no plans to cancel the convention and we are not considering a rules change at this time” DNC Communications Director Xochitl Hinojosa said in a statement this week. “Contingency planning is a routine part of preparations for any convention.”
398,Donald Trump to Travel to Virginia to Send Off Medical Ship to New York,CHARLIE SPIERING,Breitbart,2,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/26/donald-trump-to-travel-to-virginia-to-send-off-medical-ship-to-new-york/,President Donald Trump on Thursday announced that he would travel personally to Virginia on Saturday to send off a medical ship to New York for coronavirus patients.“I think I’m going to go out and I’ll kiss it goodbye. I’ll go to Virginia as you know. I’ll go and we’ll be waving together” Trump said adding “Great ship.”The medical ship USNS Comfort is currently at the Norfolk naval base and will arrive in New York City on Monday. The Comfort has 1000 medical beds 12 fully equipped operating rooms and up to 1200 doctors nurses and medical specialists.“I actually look forward to Saturday to see it go” Trump said who added that there would be a farewell ceremony in Norfolk.The ship is expected to provide hospital surge capacity for medical care for patients in New York City as the city struggles with the coronavirus outbreak.
399,Donald Trump Casts Doubt on China’s Coronavirus Numbers,CHARLIE SPIERING,Breitbart,2,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/26/donald-trump-casts-doubt-on-chinas-coronavirus-numbers/,President Donald Trump cast doubt Thursday on the official coronavirus numbers coming out of China.“You don’t know what the numbers are in China” Trump said to reporters during the White House press briefing on Thursday evening.Trump was asked by a reporter to respond to the news that the United States was on track to have more cases of the virus than China.The president said that the high number of cases in the United States was a sign of success at speeding up testing for the virus.“I’m sure you’re not able to tell what China is testing or not testing. I think that’s a little hard” Trump said.Trump revealed he was expecting to speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping on a phone call Thursday night about the virus.When asked why he stopped calling the coronavirus virus a “Chinese virus” he said that he no longer needed to repeat it as often.“I talk about the Chinese virus and I mean it that’s where it came from … this was a Chinese virus” he said. “But I don’t have to say it if they feel so strongly about it.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has ordered an international travel ban that effectively stops all foreign air travelers from entering Canada.Today flights from highly-affected countries such as South Korea India Canada Brazil and Japan have continued despite experts admitting that foreign travel has been the largest contributor to the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S.This survey was conducted March 19 to 24 and polled more than 11500 U.S. adults.

[Emphasis added]The group which includes investment giants Blackstone Carlyle and KKR has a record $1.5 trillion in cash ready to deploy and has been actively seeking deals across the struggling travel entertainment and energy industries according to a half-dozen investment bankers who declined to be identified to speak candidly about potential clients. [Emphasis added]“They have been waiting for this type of market dislocation” the head of mergers at a major Wall Street firm told CNBC. “I don’t think they wanted something quite this bad but they did want a pullback in valuation.” [Emphasis added]Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Commissioner Rohit Chopra has blasted the predatory practices currently being used to further devastate American small businesses and monopolize economic power.“Small business in America is facing extinction” Chopra wrote on Twitter. “COVID19 has put them in peril. But it’s the predatory fallout that could wipe them out for good.”“Small businesses shouldn’t go extinct” Chopra wrote. “We need to preserve them by throwing them a lifeline to stay afloat and by policing against shameless shakedowns during our national emergency.”Chopra detailed three impending “existential threats” to small business amid the coronavirus crisis noting how multinational corporations like Amazon are using the pandemic to further devastate smaller and medium-sized sellers:Small business in America is facing extinction. COVID19 has put them in peril. But it’s the predatory fallout that could wipe them out for good. Here are three existential threats they face:1. Loan sharks are crippling cash-strapped companies. Their poison pill loans come with exorbitant rates draconian terms and an automatic green light to collect whatever they can when a company falls short.The lawyers work for lenders that offer pricey payday-style loans using sketchy contract terms to restaurants and businesses.2. Powerful firms are using supply chain disruptions to cut off small companies that depend on them – a blow that many will not survive. Amazon sellers brace for layoffs and worse after coronavirus-related products get prioritySellers are worried their businesses will be hit hard by Amazon's decision to restrict warehouse shipments.3. Vulture investors especially in private equity are waiting in the wings to scoop up scores of struggling businesses on the cheap through ""roll-up"" deals. They can then extract cash by saddling companies with debt and kicking workers to the curb. Chopra said “lawyers running lawsuit mills are suing small businesses to extract cash” and that small businesses are “now under siege” suggesting immediate federal action to stop the predatory deals.Many small businesses are now under siege. Lawyers working for loan sharks are invoking ""confessions of judgment"" clauses to get a green light to collect whatever these businesses and their owners have left after being crippled by this crisis. Small businesses need help now to stop lenders and their lawyers from exploiting this emergency and kicking small businesses while they're down.--> We need a moratorium on these sham collection actions.--> We need to crack down on abusive take-it-or-leave-it contract terms.While restaurants local retail shops movie theaters and other small to medium-sized American businesses have been forced to close their doors Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard has warned of a 30 percent unemployment rate during the year’s second quarter."

403,Exclusive—Sen. Lindsey Graham Calls on Governors Nationwide to Develop Plan to Fix Coronavirus Unemployment Loophole,MATTHEW BOYLE,Breitbart,2,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2020/03/26/exclusive-sen-lindsey-graham-calls-on-governors-nationwide-to-develop-plan-to-fix-coronavirus-unemployment-loophole/,Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) the chairman of the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and a top ally of President Donald Trump told Breitbart News exclusively on Thursday that he is calling on governors especially those in red states to develop a fix to an unemployment loophole in the massive $2 trillion coronavirus rescue passage the Senate passed Wednesday night.The bill for which Graham and 95 other senators voted passed the U.S. Senate unanimously on Wednesday evening. It only got 96 votes because four GOP senators are quarantining due to either having coronavirus or concerns they might have been exposed. The bill is expected to pass the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday morning via voice vote House leaders say and will make its way to President Trump’s desk where he is expected to sign it.The bill contains many positive things to help rescue the economy including direct payments to many Americans as well as funds for a variety of industries and loans for small businesses that will be forgiven assuming they maintain their workforces. But one particular part of the bill Graham told Breitbart News represents a potential serious threat to the economy as a whole—and he said that while he voted for the overall package this problem needs to be fixed soon.“There’s a lot of good stuff—that’s why I voted for it” Graham told Breitbart News in an exclusive interview on Thursday afternoon.The problem the senator explained is that this bill includes an additional $600 per person per week if they are laid off or unemployed. The federal government has never had a federal unemployment program as those matters and benefits have been handled by the states until this bill. The issue here however as Graham explained is that in some cases people may end up—by collecting unemployment checks from both their state and the federal government—making more money per week during the four-month duration of this novel federal unemployment program than they would should they keep their job.“I was willing to reimburse people—to supplement unemployment benefits to their actual wages up to $50000” Graham said. “Make you whole. The unemployment benefit in South Carolina is $326. So the federal government created the $600 supplement for every state. My goal was to make people whole up to around $48000 or $49000. What’s happened here is if you make $30000 you’re going to wind up getting reimbursed under unemployment up to $48000. Your weekly pay will go from a $30000 salary to a $48000 or $49000 salary.”In the state of South Carolina for instance the maximum weekly unemployment benefit Graham said is $326 a week. So people who are laid off due to the coronavirus crisis would collect that plus an extra $600 per week from the federal government under this bill. Given the unique nature of the coronavirus crisis—which is the fault of no American—Graham said his and other senators’ goal is to ensure that people are “made whole” in that they get their whole salary through these expanded unemployment benefits. But he is concerned that this loophole in the program where the states and federal government are not in sync with each other may end up making it such that somebody makes more money by collecting both unemployment benefits than they would by working.“Let’s use South Carolina as an example—$326 a week is the maximum benefit” Graham said. “I want to be more generous than that. We have a $600 federal pot. If you’re making $30000 a year I don’t know what that is a week. About $576. So you should go from $326 up to $576 but under the way the bill is written you’d get $600 on top of the $326. That incentivizes people not to work because the computer can’t make the adjustment which is bizarre to me because to get the unemployment benefits you have to give the agency information on your wages—what you make at work—and who your employer is.”In other words somebody making $30000 a year in South Carolina could end up making more than a $48000 salary during the four months in which this program is in place. That makes the average hourly wage of collecting unemployment under this system in South Carolina around $23 an hour—more than many well-paying jobs in the state. The issue is similar with different numbers in other states. That could have an adverse effect on hiring—as companies like Amazon which is reportedly looking to hire right now would be competing against the government paying higher wages for not working than they can afford to pay for somebody to work.“The average hourly wage for unemployment benefits in South Carolina would be $23.14 an hour” Graham said. “So if you’re making $15 working you look like a chump. So bottom line is it’s going to be difficult for people to hire because they’re competing with a $23 an hour government wage. So like Amazon wants to hire 100000 people? They’d probably take $14 or $15 an hour. But they’d have to jack their wages up which would affect the entire economy. So this artificially incentivizes people to stay out of the workforce and it makes hiring in certain areas of the economy almost impossible due to the technological glitch.”If someone were making more than that—say $30 or $40 an hour—Graham says “you would only go on unemployment if you were laid off.”“But here’s the really perverse incentive: The average household income in South Carolina for a couple a family or household is $51000. Under this bill if you have a husband and wife—if they’re making $51000 together in combined income—under this bill each one would get $926 or whatever it is and they would go from a household income of $51000 to over $90000. The incentive for the couple is to not go to work for four months.”What Graham wants to happen is for anyone affected by the coronavirus crisis to make their full salary if they are laid off during it. But what he does not want is the government making it such that people make more money by collecting unemployment benefits than by working. In other words he wants to set it up in states whereby the state unemployment benefit would match their salary—whereas currently the state provides people a benefit that is less than their full salary. The full $600 extra from the federal government should match up to what someone is making but not have them making more than when they were employed.“We want to make them whole but we want to not have a system where they make more money to not work” Graham said. “I was the first Republican to reach across the aisle and say ‘let’s beef up unemployment.’ I never dreamed that we’d come up with this system. I never dreamed that we would have a system that pay people not to work. I wanted to make them whole people in the low level of the economy. But it went the other way. In South Carolina if you combine the two it’s $23 an hour. Ted Cruz told me in Texas it’s $28 an hour. So a lot of people are not making $28 an hour in Texas.”The issue Graham said is the state unemployment systems—which are different in each state—are months away from modernizing payment structures and technology to be able to make people whole but not pay them more to not work.“Here’s the problem. The reason we can’t do this apparently is they tell me that state unemployment insurance systems can’t do this” Graham said. “We land two men on the moon but I’ve been told it’s going to take six to eight months for state unemployment insurance systems to be able to cut a check for the difference between a state unemployment benefit and your actual income. That to me is astounding that in the 21st century state unemployment systems can’t make this adjustment in less than six or eight months. Now what does that mean? It means for the next four months we’re going to have an incentive to leave the workforce.”Graham said that the problem needs to be fixed as soon as possible because if the virus resurges in the fall even after public health efforts by the Trump administration vanquish it this go around then the country may need to turn back to this system as a solution again.“So I am not going to tolerate this as the answer for the country” Graham said. “The virus will probably come back in the fall and this will hit us all over again and when there’s a big spike in unemployment due to the containment policies we face a Hobson’s choice here. With 3.3 million unemployment claims announced this morning it’s probably going to get worse here. So it’s imperative that we fix this so that we don’t incentivize people to leave the workforce. We need to fix this because this problem is going to be with us for a very long time.”So to answer the problem Graham said he is calling on Republican governors nationwide and red state insurance commissioners to develop a solution that can serve as a model for the nation.“So what I’m going to do when we get back is create incentives for states to fix this problem so that you get made whole but you don’t get a pay raise” Graham said. “I am looking for a conservative governor to show the country how to do this. I believe that a governor that can figure out a state unemployment commissioner that can figure out how to fix the system is going to get rewarded by the federal government but it’s also going to help the economy. Under the current system you’re literally paying people more not to work.”Graham has not since this interview with Breitbart News on Thursday afternoon spoken with any governors yet but he intends to begin doing so soon starting with South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster.“I’m going to start with my governor” Graham said. “I was told by [Eugene] Scalia: Y’all need to call somebody at Labor. There are rules on the books that won’t be followed. The rules are you can’t get unemployment if you quit so if people leave their jobs to get more unemployment that’s not going to be enforced. You need a small army to enforce that. Employers are not going to throw their people over. So I hear about all the way the law works I live in the real world—I live on Main Street—and I know exactly what’s going to happen here. If you make $23 an hour not to work for four months most people will probably do that.”Graham said he’s confident that somewhere in America a governor or insurance commissioner will solve this problem.“Somebody will invent a software that can be widely applied” Graham said. “Then again—in Bernie’s world Bernie Sanders’ world I’m being mean. But I think we’re being smart because most Americans would prefer to work and most Americans want to pay their government to pay people more to work than not to work. In Bernie’s world that’s fine—he’s okay with a $23 an hour minimum wage.”Then when a state develops a solution Graham will take that back to Congress and offer it up for the whole country.“Then I get the Congress to basically revisit this issue and take the solution and spread it around and give people 30 days to implement and give them money to help implement it and if they don’t they’re going to lose some of that benefit” Graham said. “Carrots and sticks.”Graham said the coronavirus pandemic has exposed a previously unknown vulnerability in the state-run unemployment system and now with the federal government creating its first-ever such program—even though it’s temporary—those weaknesses are being thrust into the spotlight.“Our state unemployment system was like our testing system: It wasn’t set up to deal with a pandemic” Graham said. “Well this may not be the last one we have and this thing may come back in the fall so we have to fix it now. Every day we go forward it puts pressure on the economy. You can’t really regenerate because you’ve created a perverse incentive for people to be out of the workforce.”That’s why Graham is hopeful that a state somewhere in the union probably one with a GOP governor will sort this out.“We’re making a call to arms here to see if we can get some state to figure this out so we can make people whole but not create an incentive to get out of the workforce because this is a real problem and people will be incentivized not to go back to work and people who need to hire are going to have a hard time of it” Graham said.

I just want to be clear about that.""Coronavirus cases continue to rise in the United States and especially in New York City where there is an oversized percentage of the infected and in deaths from the pandemic."
405,Stanford medical professors: COVID-19 death toll estimates may be 'orders of magnitude' too high,Giancarlo Sopo,The Blaze,2,https://www.theblaze.com/news/stanford_coronavirus_too_high_death,"A pair of public health experts from Stanford Drs. Eran Bendavid and Jay Bhattacharya warn Americans in a Wall Street Journal editorial that the current estimates about the coronavirus' fatality rate may be too high by ""orders of magnitude.""According to Bendavid and Bhattacharya both of whom are medical doctors while they are supportive of social distancing guidelines and efforts to contain the disease they fear that orders to shut down the entire economy may be based on shoddy research data.Death toll projects may be 'orders of magnitude too high'""If it's true that the novel coronavirus would kill millions without shelter-in-place orders and quarantines then the extraordinary measures being carried out in cities and states around the country are surely justified"" they wrote. ""But"" and what a big one it is they add ""there's little evidence to confirm that premise — and projections of the death toll could plausibly be orders of magnitude too high.""The two submit that because the United States and other countries largely focus their testing on symptomatic patients the number of people who are infected with COVID-19 is likely much larger than the number of confirmed cases being reported by public health agencies throughout the country which means the virus' mortality rate is likely significantly lower.""Fear of Covid-19 is based on its high estimated case fatality rate — 2% to 4% of people with confirmed Covid-19 have died according to the World Health Organization and others"" wrote Bendavid and Bhattacharya. ""So if 100 million Americans ultimately get the disease 2 million to 4 million could die. We believe that estimate is deeply flawed. The true fatality rate is the portion of those infected who die not the deaths from identified positive cases.""How did they predict this?The two professors argue that the best evidence of the coronavirus death rate being significantly lower than what is being reported may lie in the Italian town of Vò. On March 6 the town's 3300 residents were tested. Of these 90 tests came back positive indicating a prevalence of 2.7% of the population having the virus.If one were to apply this to the entire province where the town is located which has a population of 955000 it would mean there were actually 26000 infections at the time and not just the 198 that were officially confirmed. This would be 130 times greater than the number of reported cases. Since Italy's case fatality rate of 8% is estimated using the confirmed cases Bendavid and Bhattacharya write ""the real fatality rate [of the virus] could in fact be closer to 0.06%.""A 'cause for optimism'?The two Stanford Health Policy experts even said the virus' mortality rate might be on par with that of the seasonal flu:Existing evidence suggests that the virus is highly transmissible and that the number of infections doubles roughly every three days. An epidemic seed on Jan. 1 implies that by March 9 about six million people in the U.S. would have been infected. As of March 23 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention there were 499 Covid-19 deaths in the U.S. If our surmise of six million cases is accurate that's a mortality rate of 0.01% assuming a two week lag between infection and death. This is one-tenth of the flu mortality rate of 0.1%. Such a low death rate would be cause for optimism.A universal lockdown 'may not be worth the costs'Bendavid and Bhattacharya say that if they are right about the lower lethality of the epidemic public policy experts should focus their measures on protecting the elderly and expanding medical capacity.""Hospital resources will need to be reallocated to care for the critically ill patients. Triage will need to improve. And policy makers will need to focus on reducing risks for older adults and people with underlying medical conditions.""The pair conclude that if their estimates are right then the universal quarantine measures ""may not be worth the costs it imposes on the economy community and individual mental and physical health.""""We should undertake immediate steps to evaluate the empirical basis of the current lockdowns"" they added."

Maddow has echoed similar calls for censorship under the guise the president's daily briefings are misleading the public.""If it were up to me and it's not I would stop putting those briefings on live TV"" she said on her show last week.MSNBC employees are also concerned they may be unwittingly contributing to Trump's re-election.""Sunday was like open-mic night"" a staffer told the Daily Beast adding that Trump might be benefiting politically from the pandemic because ""people want to believe he's got this.

A public radio station in Washington state KUOW-FM will no longer air the White House's press briefings on the coronavirus ""due to a pattern of false or misleading information provided that cannot be fact checked in real time.""Why now?The calls to censor the president's daily coronavirus briefings could be the result of numerous polls showing Americans rallying around him during the national crisis. A Gallup study released Tuesday found that 49% of Americans approve of Trump's overall job performance matching the highest figure ever of his presidency.Gallup analyst Jeffrey Jones noted:Trump's response to the novel coronavirus pandemic may be behind his higher overall approval rating. Americans give the president generally positive reviews for his handling of the situation with 60% approving and 38% disapproving. Ninety-four percent of Republicans 60% of independents and 27% of Democrats approve of his response.The poll also found that Americans are likely to trust the Trump administration and Congress' handling of the situation than they are the media. Only 44% of the survey's respondents approve of the news media's response to coronavirus while 55% disapprove. This is compared to 60% and 61% who said the same of Trump and Pence respectively.A Harris Insights study found similar results with 50% of Americans approve of the job the country's 45th commander-in-chief is doing as president."

Probably and — I mean definitely — would be in far greater numbers than the numbers that we're talking about with regard to the virus.""President Trump made the comment as a warning that an economic collapse also carries its own major public health risks that are worth considering when determining when and how to re-open the American economy.The AP's 'expert' doesn't even agree with themWhile the AP claims the ""experts"" it consulted said that President Trump is wrong on the impact of prolonged social distancing guidelines on mental health the one specialist the news agency spoke with was actually hesitant to make a prediction.""It is not a foregone conclusion that we will see increased suicide rates"" said Dr. Christine Moutier of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention on the issue of whether quarantines themselves result in self-inflicted deaths. The link between suicide and economic depressions which is what Trump was actually referring to is far more clear. In fact the AP buried in its own fact-check as a passing reference that suicides increased during the Great Depression.Researchers say the 'suicide rate rises and falls in connection with the economy'Decades of social research back President Trump's contention: When unemployment levels rise during economic recessions so do suicides. Several major studies have examined the relationship between the two and determined as such:A 2011 study by the CDC concluded that the ""overall suicide rate rises and falls in connection with the economy."" In its research the CDC examined the relationship between business cycles and suicide rates since the 1920s and found that suicides ""generally rose in recessions like the Great Depression (1929-1933) the end of the New Deal (1937-1938) the Oil Crisis (1973-1975) and the Double-Dip Recession (1980-1982) and fell in expansions like the WWII period (1939-1945) and the longest expansion period (1991-2001) in which the economy experienced fast growth and low unemployment.""A 2003 report published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health found: ""Being unemployed was associated with a twofold to threefold increased relative risk of death by suicide compared with being employed. About half of this association might be attributable to confounding by mental illness.""A 2009 paper in the Journal of Economic Psychology examined the link between suicide and unemployment and determined the two were closely related in wealthy nations: ""We support that higher income is associated with higher suicide rates. In particular the evidence shows that the implied effect of unemployment on suicide rates is positive for countries with higher income.""Given the compelling social research — and with jobless claims soaring to the highest levels in history on Thursday while a fed official warns of an precedented 30% unemployment rate — the Trump administration is right to be concerned about the public health risks of the various responses to the COVID-19 pandemic it has at its disposal."
411,Commentary: The economic realities could be greater than the virus,Ryan Helfenbein,The Blaze,2,https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/commentary-the-economic-realities-could-be-greater-than-the-virus,"Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel once famously stated ""Never let a good crisis go to waste.""As of today the total U.S cases of the coronavirus nears 66000 with total number of deaths at almost 1000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost over 35% of its value from its mid-February zenith of nearly 30000 points. March 9 Black Monday was the single greatest point loss in U.S. market history when the index fell 2013.76 points.Political actors are now exploiting this crisis to transform American freedom.Senate Republicans attempted to pass a $1.8 trillion package as a lifeline to save the country from complete economic collapse. It fell short of the 60 votes necessary to pass. Alternatively House and Senate Democrats wasted no time with a separate proposal that highlighted a radical new vision for America.House Majority Whip James Clyburn said last week ""This was a tremendous opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision.""Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi looked for an opportunity to give more collective bargaining power to unions expand wind and solar tax credits and create new fuel emission standards that would all but promise to destroy the airline industry it was seeking to aid.These provisions were not economic but ideological. No different than the kind of provisions the Green New Deal was seeking to employ that would not only ensure the decline of the American economy but more importantly American freedom.COVID-19 which originated in China's Wuhan province and was covered up by the Chinese Communist Party with the help of the World Health Organization has had devastating effects on human life and the economy all around the world.The 15-day quarantine in America has already cost trillions in market capital but long-term it threatens to do more than that to American freedom if a balanced approach to fighting the virus cannot be reached.Can you really save American lives by destroying the American economy?Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick made headlines on Tucker Carlson's show this week by suggesting that as a senior citizen he would be willing to put his own life at risk in the coronavirus pandemic if it would mean ""keeping the America that America loves for your children and grandchildren"" adding ""I'm all in.""No doubt the consequences of economic shutdown means more to Patrick than a mere financial sacrifice he is talking about liberty itself. The freedom and way of life enjoyed by Americans today would be significantly altered if the economy underwent a collapse.President Trump said at a White House press briefing ""Our country wasn't built to be shut down"" adding ""America will again and soon be open for business.""The great economic Nobel laureate Milton Friedman taught us that free markets and economic freedom are ""a necessary condition for political freedom."" This is literally what defines the American experiment and why economics isn't just about money and certainly not greed.Economics is about the human dignity flourishing individual liberty and the freedom to choose.The political reality of the United States is based on the economic miracles of an elaborate system of cooperation and collaboration in private free markets. Destroy the market economy and you don't just inhibit a free peoples' ability to earn money you place significant constraints on their freedom opportunity and voluntarism.Furthermore you leave an unchecked federal bureaucracy with unrestricted coercive power to violate freedom and the precepts of God-given rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. A well-meaning government bureaucracy cannot do better in the long-term than what God-fearing freedom-loving people can achieve through self-interest voluntarism and cooperation.This is the American experiment at its finest. A mobilized economy can do more to rapidly deploy life-saving tools medicines and instruments of war against a virus than it can in waiting. World War II was won on European battlefields and Asian-Pacific waters not only as a result brave-fighting man but because of unparalleled supply chains distribution and production. In three short years the American domestic economy produced 27 aircraft carriers 1200 naval vessels 300000 aircraft and 86000 tanks and was catapulted out of the Great Depression.Right now President Trump understands this fact. He is responding to this challenge by marshaling the resources of the private sector to shore up our domestic production and distribution of a vast quantity of medical supplies testing kits and the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine. He understands that dependence on China to both tell the truth and supply critical infrastructure in a moment of crisis was a mistake not of his making.Whatever decision is made over the next several days this is one of the greatest tests of the president and the nation in our lifetime. It is deserving of our deepest prayers unconditional support and unmitigated action.Make no mistake America will survive the coronavirus but we cannot expect freedom to prosper or persevere if we destroy the conditions upon which it has thrived for over 200 years."
412,Horowitz: State legislatures must convene to control governors' growing tyranny,Daniel Horowitz,The Blaze,2,https://www.theblaze.com/op-ed/horowitz-state-legislatures-must-convene-to-control-governors-growing-tyranny,"It's become a game. Every day at a specific time each governor and now even county executive announces a press conference where with the flick of the pen they issue edicts that violate more inalienable natural rights than at any time in this nation's history. What started out as a prudent move has now devolved into a free-for-all of tyranny against peaceful citizens as authorities release criminals from prison. It's time to demand that state legislatures reconvene and start setting parameters and guidelines. It's time to return to self-governance.We all went along with the severe social distancing and the termination of all public gatherings to help safety during this epidemic. Even this is no picnic because it includes the cancellation of all religious services as well as school. We must recognize the danger of unilateral executive actions halting the most sacred constitutional rights. Nonetheless it was clear that these first actions were called for and passed the rational basis test of using the policies least restrictive of liberty to achieve a vital state interest.Now however that states are moving to indefinite lockdowns without presenting any evidence that this is needed over and above the severe distancing it's past time for us to ask questions. Placing Americans indefinitely under house arrest without any due process transparency time limit guidelines or checks and balances on a single executive is something that should shake us to our core.That is true even if we were dealing with Ebola and a 60 percent death rate. It would certainly be necessary in that case but still we should be jarred by the short-term and long-term implications of one county or state official wielding such power and the economic logistical mental health and physical health problems it's creating. Mark my words: This genie will not be put back in the bottle.Here is the state of play at this moment. President Trump clearly understands the need for a proper balance and to more effectively target the quarantine while putting as many people back to work as possible. However the governors have made it clear that they have an agenda to keep wielding this power indefinitely and won't even join the president in at least striving for a return to work – not even to normal life but just to the first level of social distancing – by mid-April. There is something very disquieting about what is motivating these governors to act so callously against liberty and not even treat this as an evil at all even a necessary one.Also numerous blue city and county executives are ordering house arrest policies. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is threatening to cut off power and water to businesses. If these are the drastic measures they're taking less than two weeks into this one can only imagine where they are headed unless we check their behavior.Patriots need to prepare for this showdown if and when the federal government offers guidance to achieve proper balance and states still reject it for political reasons. Are we really OK with giving governors and county/city executives this much power indefinitely?We want strong leadership during a time of crisis and you can't have legislatures making every last decision. But there must be some checks and balances or at least transparency measures checking these emergency powers that violate the essence of the Declaration of Independence especially when much of the science driving the underlying push for lockdown appears to be driven by the same politicized academia as global warming.Moreover there already are numerous cooks in the kitchen with each governor and county leader drawing up his or her own royal edicts. So why not at least bring a few hundred legislators into the process?It's time for patriots to flood their state legislators with calls and demand that they reconvene and deal with some of the liberty issues crime and logistical and fiscal issues inherent in this crisis. It's time to return to self-government. They must push legislation along the following lines:Require that any violation of the Constitution under the guise of stemming an epidemic expire after seven days. In order to renew it the governor would need to submit clear findings to the legislature and publicize them online articulating why this is the least restrictive means necessary to achieve the goal.Address the parameters of why some functions are deemed essential and weigh them against the public safety concerns.No top-level state official may get paid until the severe lockdown orders are rescinded.Stop the unaccountable release of criminals.Within the home rule parameters of state laws rein in the edicts of some cities that are taking these measures too far.There must be a rigorous debate about the underlying data driving specific strategies and whether they are really prudent.These are very reasonable and simple ideas that still leave the governors with tremendous latitude.Finally President Trump must tell these local officials that if they continue to destroy the economy after these measures are no longer necessary they own the mess. Right now they are counting on getting bailed out from the economic mess and don't see any downside to their tyrannical virtue-signaling. The bill headed for Trump's desk now sends $150 billion to the states. That must change. They can't play up state powers in both directions – become dictators but then count on a federal bailout.Patrick Henry famously said ""Give me liberty or give me death."" We need not choose between liberty and death here but if our Founders valued liberty to that extent does it not behoove us to at least get on the playing field and call some red flags? As John Adams wrote in 1765 ""Liberty must at all hazards be supported. We have a right to it derived from our Maker. But if we had not our fathers have earned and bought it for us at the expense of their ease their estates their pleasure and their blood."""

So how can you protect yourself while shopping and after you get home?If you live in a place where you can have your groceries delivered that's a great option because it keeps you away from other people in the store who could be carrying COVID-19. However plan ahead because many delivery services are slammed and of course not everyone has that ability.So if or more likely when you venture out to the store James Rogers with Consumer Reports suggests going early. ""We also say bring your own disinfectant wipes"" Rogers said. Sanitize the handle of your cart before taking off down any aisles.Stay six feet away from other shoppers even if it means waiting a few seconds longer to grab your pack of toilet paper. Avoid touching your face while you shop.Experts say there's no need to wear a mask unless you're sick or caring for someone who's sick.If you decide to wear gloves be sure to take them off without contaminating yourself then wash your hands for good measure.FOR CBN NEWS CONTINUING COVERAGE ON COVID-19 CLICK HERE. And what about bags?There's growing concern reusable bags contribute to the spread of COVID-19. Several states have already banned them in an effort to stop the virus.However there is some good news about the items you're placing in your cart.""Right now we don't have any clear data that it's living on packages for a prolonged period of time"" says Dr. Simone Wildes an infectious disease specialist.There's no evidence yet that coronavirus can be transmitted via food. So once you get your groceries home experts recommend washing your fruits and vegetables as you normally would under warm water. You can also use white vinegar or lemon juice. Items with firm rinds like melons or skins like potatoes can be scrubbed with a brush. Glass or canned goods can be rinsed under warm water.Once you put your groceries away throw away your bags and clean your countertops with an antimicrobial disinfectant.And remember the greatest risk while grocery shopping is exposure to people who may have the virus which is why social distancing remains so important."

States and municipalities would still retain authority to set whatever restrictions deem necessary. Trump has been seeking for days to determine how to contain the economic fallout of the guidelines issued by his administration as well as local leaders to slow the tide of infections. Last week he unveiled a 15-day program advising against large gatherings and calling for many Americans to remain at home - and many states have placed even greater restrictions on their residents.Trump said the rollout of new testing will enable more nuanced recommendations that would allow some lesser-impacted parts of the country to regain a sense of normalcy sooner.""Our expanded testing capabilities will quickly enable us to publish criteria developed in close coordination with the Nation's public health officials and scientists to help classify counties with respect to continued risks posed by the virus"" Trump said.Earlier Thursday Trump held a conference call with the nation's governors to update them on the federal government's response."
418,If COVID-19 Pandemic Overwhelms Hospitals Could Older and Disabled Americans be Left Out?,Paul Strand,CBN,2,https://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2020/march/if-covid-19-pandemic-overwhelms-hospitals-could-older-and-disabled-americans-be-left-out,"WASHINGTON - Word is getting around at least in Washington state that some officials and medical personnel are considering how to ration live-saving care among coronavirus patients if that population should swell and overwhelm hospitals. This has some among the aged and disabled worried that in such a dire situation they may be discriminated against and maybe even left to die.Charles Camosy a bioethicist professor at Fordham University in New York and some prominent allies are trying to prevent that happening. Life-and-Death MatterHe told CBN News he's concerned by what he's heard is coming out on this life-and-death matter in Washington state where the Seattle area was particularly hard-hit by the virus after a man brought the disease back to the US from China. ""Washington state actually has an approved protocol that not only is going to consider age but things like ability physical ability cognitive ability"" Camosy said. He finds labels like that ""quite disturbing.""Does the professor fear those kinds of guidelines could spread across the nation in a worst-case scenario involving the virus and that older or more disabled people could face deadly discrimination if they're struck hard by COVID-19?Camosy says it's a matter that's up in the air but he expects quite the debate in the coming days. Because these guidelines could lead to rationing varying widely from state to state.For instance in New York state Camosy says it has a medical protocol that says specifically no focus on age or ability should be considered.Discriminating by Age or Disability 'Would be a Violation of Civil Rights'""And it explicitly says something that is quite true: that this would be a violation of civil rights of people who are older and people who are disabled"" Camosy noted.He points out Washington state's and New York's medical guidelines are so different on rationing health care and that's why this is a matter that's both unsettling and so unsettled. ""It may come to HHS – the Health and Human Services Office of the federal government -- or even courts deciding what we ought to do"" the professor predicted.Camosy along with Princeton professor Robert George who served on the President's Council on Bioethics and Harvard lecturer Jacqueline Rivers asked two prominent legal groups specializing in rights to weigh in with the states to warn them against discriminating if rationing becomes necessary.Unthinkable Untenable 'Devaluation of Each & Every Human Life'Peter Breen of the Thomas More Society said ""We're reading the unthinkable. The Seattle Times reported that Washington state and hospital officials have been meeting to consider how to decide who lives and dies.""""The horrific idea of withholding care from someone because they are elderly or disabled is untenable and represents a giant step in the devaluation of each and every human life in America"" he warned. Camosy summed up what these legal groups wrote the states paraphrasing ""We really haven't tested this principle in a pandemic for a very long time but you're still not allowed to violate someone's civil rights even in a pandemic.""'Will We Preserve Our Humanity?'""Unless we have a miracle drug that shows up at the last minute we're going to be rationing health care. The question is will we preserve our humanity in the process? Will we follow the very basic values and ethical principles that we hold dear?"" Camosy asked.One additional fear he has is that doctors will likely be the ones making many of those life-and-death decisions if the virus overwhelms medical systems.""I know very many good doctors good-hearted Christian doctors as well as good-hearted non-Christian doctors"" the bioethicist stressed. ""But in the general and in the main doctors are some of the worst people we'd want making quality-of-life judgments.""He says that's because they so often guess exactly wrong about what their patients want like believing they'd usually pick living a shorter life if it meant they'd have a higher quality of life. ""In fact the opposite is true. Patients would rather have a longer life compared to a greater quality of life in a shorter time"" Camosy explained. ""So maybe we ought to start thinking about these things but maybe doctors ought not to be the people in the front lines making those decisions."""

Dr. Leandro Rodriguez Lastra received a 14-month suspended jail sentence. In addition he was also told by the court he couldn't hold public office for a period of 28 months according to the bioethics news website BioEdge. Back in 2017 the 19-year-old victim was in her fifth month of pregnancy after being sexually abused by a relative. She first tried an abortion drug but it failed. She was referred to Dr. Lastra who at the time was the head of gynecology at a local hospital.Lastra told the court the proposed abortion posed a risk to both the unborn child and the mother. However the judges presiding over the case responded that the only requirement necessary for the legal termination of a pregnancy was a formal request from the victim according to BioEdge. Abortion until the 20th week of gestation is legal in Río Negro when a pregnant woman is found to have been raped according to the Buenos Aires Times. The child was born and was later given up for adoption.In a divided opinion two of the judges on the panel said Lastra was guilty of the crime of ""failure to comply with the duties of a public official."" Lastra's lawyer told BioEdge the ruling could be overturned by the Argentinean Superior Court.The verdict he said ""is a mere ideological expression that shows that they did not look at anything in the trial in fact they practically do not cite the witnesses or anything that happened there. It's as if they didn't see it. …if the Superior Court or the Court applies the law as it should we will be able to overturn this ruling."""

That's the message from Washington today as the Senate celebrates the passing of the unprecedented $2.3 trillion bill aimed at stabilizing the economy and providing financial relief for millions of Americans. After hours of negotiations and a few unexpected speed bumps senators rallied late Wednesday night to unanimously pass the largest economic relief bill in America's history.Now it's in the hands of the House of Representatives which is expected to pass the bill by voice vote on Friday allowing members in self-quarantine or in states with shelter in place restrictions to stay home.""Right now we have the legislation that will come to the floor tomorrow I anticipate and feel certain that we will have a strong bipartisan vote"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) told reporters on Thursday.The 880-page measure includes sending checks of $1200 directly to most Americans with an additional $500 per child. It also includes $150 billion designated for hospitals bolstered unemployment benefits the suspension on federal student loan payments $377 billion for small businesses to cover payroll rent and utilities $450 billion in loans for large corporations and $25 billion in grants to the airline industry. ""Our members put forward a bold plan to send cash to households stand up historic emergency loans for Main Street stabilize key sectors and put the full might of Congress behind our doctors nurses hospitals health care providers and the race for treatments and vaccines. I couldn't be prouder"" said Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY). Republicans also included two pro-life protections in the bill. The Hyde Amendment – which prohibits the use of federal funds to pay for abortions – will be enforced for supplemental appropriations to hospitals and health care providers. And the Hyde Amendment will still apply to the money in this bill that was set aside for community health initiatives and graduate teaching health centers.Additionally Planned Parenthood does not meet the ""small business"" requirements so they will be ineligible to receive infusions of cash through the small business loan section.President Trump supports the bill and he's expected to sign it as soon as it reaches his desk and lawmakers are already suggesting a phase 4 relief bill could be coming as the number of confirmed cases increases and more businesses shut down across the country."

That is a record-high number of jobless claims. It quadruples the previous record which was set in 1982. It comes amid layoffs by stalled businesses during the widespread economic shutdowns because of the coronavirus and many fear it's just the beginning.The unemployment news comes as the US Senate has just passed a historic $2.2 trillion economic rescue package that would mean checks in the mail for Americans within weeks. Late Wednesday the Senate voted 96-0 to approve the relief package which aims to help both families and businesses survive in an economy spiraling into recession. The president tweeted about the relief package overnight saying ""Congratulations America!"" The House is expected to vote on the bill Friday.The legislation includes generous help for individual Americans. As it stands now the government will send people earning $75000 or less a $1200 check plus $500 per child. Those earning up to $99000 a year will get a smaller check. At a White House coronavirus task force briefing Wednesday night CBN White House Correspondent Ben Kennedy asked the president about the timing of those checks.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin explained ""Our expectation is within three weeks we will have direct payments out where we have depository information and we're looking to get a lot more information and we have procedures to do that.""He said business loans will be available even sooner. ""And at the end of next week we want all the banks to be able to originate loans same day"" said Mnuchin.The president says he would like to reopen the country by April 12th -Easter - but his medical experts say that may or may not work. Dr. Anthony Fauci the top doctor on the president's coronavirus task force has urged the public to understand that the spread of the virus is what will dictate policy. On CNN he warned ""You gotta understand you don't make the timeline. The virus makes the timeline."" The number of US deaths from the virus now tops 1000 and with the number of cases doubling every three days there's enormous concern about hospital capacity.An estimated five percent of the sick need ICU beds. An Associated Press analysis of federal hospital data shows that more than 7 million people age 60 and older who are most at risk of severe illness from the virus live in counties without ICU beds.One month after Mardi Gras Louisiana has the third-highest rate per capita in the country.

However experts have criticized the study’s design and say it is far from conclusive.President Trump said in a White House press conference that it is a promising treatment for COVID-19. He said the drug had been approved for use and he wanted to “remove any barrier” to drug testing and “allow many more Americans to access drugs that have shown really good promise.”A spokesperson for the FDA later said the drug has not been approved for use in coronavirus patients but doctors are legally allowed to prescribe a drug for any illness if they think it can help.Hydroxychloroquine is already being given to patients in New York as part of an effort to find anything that might prove effective against the coronavirus.While many hope hydroxychloroquine could be a game-changer COVID-19 treatment a recent study found it was no more effective in coronavirus patients than conventional treatments. The study was conducted by a team from the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center in China and included a small sample of just 30 patients hospitalized for COVID-19. Half of the patients were given the malaria drug for five days while the other 15 were treated normally with rest oxygen treatments and other anti-viral drugs.CT scans at the end revealed there was no statistical difference in how the disease progressed in the bodies of patients given the drug and those who were not.One patient progressed to the severe stage of the disease during the study – that patient was treated with hydroxychloroquine. Four patients given the drug developed diarrhea and signs of possible liver damage compared to those getting conventional treatment.The Chinese researchers admitted the study had a small number of patients and larger tests need to be done to accurately assess the drug’s risks and benefits in treating COVID-19 patients.White House coronavirus task force member Anthony Fauci has called reports that the malaria drug might work anecdotal and said further studies must be done.

424,Senate Finally Passes $2 Trillion Coronavirus Emergency Relief Package,Henry Rodgers,The Daily Caller,2,https://dailycaller.com/2020/03/25/senate-passes-2-trillion-coronavirus-emergency-relief-package/,The Senate passed the $2 trillion emergency relief package Wednesday to address the coronavirus pandemic after continued debate from both parties.The package passed the Senate 96-0. There were a few minor hiccups earlier in the day Wednesday as Republican South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham held a press conference with a group of Republican Senators to call for an immediate fix to a “life-threatening drafting error” in the coronavirus package.Graham was joined by South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse and Florida Sen. Rick Scott at the press conference to discuss the coronavirus emergency legislation. The presser was first announced in a tweet by Graham who said they “will discuss a massive drafting error in the current version of the coronavirus relief legislation that could have devastating consequences.”The group of Senators later agreed to drop procedural issues and let the bill move on in exchange for a vote on an amendment which failed in a 48-48 vote before the vote for final passage on the coronavirus package.Also Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and 2020 presidential candidate threatened that he will put a hold to the Senate coronavirus package unless there are stronger sanctions on a $500 billion corporate welfare fund. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell confirmed early Wednesday morning that a bipartisan deal for a nearly $2 trillion emergency relief package to address the coronavirus pandemic had been reached. He said the deal “will get more equipment to the heroes on the front lines” and that “this is a wartime level of investment.” McConnell also added that “this has been a long week for the Senate” and that the Senate is “going to pass this legislation later today.” The text came out late Wednesday after a bunch of changes were made throughout the day. Meanwhile Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi delayed the passage of the Senate’s coronavirus relief package on Wednesday as the House was in session for nearly three minutes and then adjourned until Thursday.The House will now vote on the Senate bill in order to get it to President Donald Trump’s desk so he can sign it into law.
425,Biden: ‘My Green Deal’ Could Be Part Of ‘Next Round’ Of Coronavirus Assistance,David Krayden,The Daily Caller,2,https://dailycaller.com/2020/03/26/joe-biden-green-deal-next-round-coronavirus-covoid-19-bill/,Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden claimed Wednesday that his “green deal” could be part of any future coronavirus assistance bills.Biden made the remarks during his latest monologue from his Delaware home where the former vice president has been running his campaign since the last Democratic presidential debate.The Senate passed a $2 trillion dollar stimulus bill late Wednesday after Democrats attempted to include a myriad of “social justice” measures in the legislation. “We’re going to have an opportunity I believe in the next round here to use my green economy my green deal to be able to generate both economic growth and consistent with the kind of infusion of monies we need into the system to keep it going” Biden said in livestream broadcast.The Democratic frontrunner also suggested that the answer to jobs lost during the coronavirus pandemic was employment building infrastructure.“One of the ways to make sure these jobs are available that may get lost or hurt in the meantime is to provide the kind of jobs that are prevailing wages where people are making $45 $50 an hour plus benefits by building new infrastructure” Biden explained. “We’re going to need new infrastructure going down the road here.” “It’s a way to generate economic growth.”It’s not clear whether Biden is advocating for the Green New Deal promoted by Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or his own version of the plan that did not resonate well with the congresswoman. His campaign website appears to endorse the Green New Deal calling it a “crucial framework” in the fight against climate change.
426,‘They Can’t Even Change Their Goddamn Behavior’: Greg Gutfeld Goes Off On Lawmakers For Stalled Coronavirus Bill,Scott Morefield,The Daily Caller,2,https://dailycaller.com/2020/03/25/greg-gutfeld-stalled-coronavirus-bill/,Fox News host Greg Gutfeld didn’t hold anything back on Wednesday’s “The Five” as he criticized lawmakers for holding up the coronavirus relief package.After Senate Republicans and Democrats reached an agreement on the bill’s contents House Speaker Nancy Pelosi delayed House passage until Thursday claiming to want to “review the final provisions and legislative text of the agreement to determine a course of action.”Prior to the Senate’s deal House Democrats wrote their own version that included several “woke” provisions that had nothing to do with immediate coronavirus relief.Asked by co-host Dana Perino for his thoughts Gutfeld began with Democrats’ objection to any sort of corporate relief.“In order for people keep that thought in their head they have to pretend that corporations are run by some kind of inanimate object” Gutfeld said. “Corporations are made up of people. The people have families. Families consist of children. People need the money so they can continue living and of course pay their rent. I disagree. You don’t have to get this bill to be perfect. We don’t have the luxury of perfection right now. We have to get something through that will help people.”“When you see people in disasters who take advantage of those those earthquakes or floods they are called looters” he continued. “And the fiends who are sneaking stuff into this relief package or trying to slow it down they’re looters too because they are a hurting relief package that is there for millions and millions of people and government is not helping by wasting our time.”Asking sardonically what “these people do for a living” Gutfeld added “For the past two weeks we have sacrificed our freedoms so that we can beat this virus. And they can’t even stop acting like politicians with a metaphorical gun to their heads i.e. a virus in an emergency situation. They can’t even change their goddamn behavior. It is absolutely disgusting!”After co-host Jesse Watters took his turn criticizing lawmakers Gutfeld jumped in to apologize for his on-air language.“Excuse me sorry I just want to apologize for swearing a few minutes ago. I lost my cool” he said.“I didn’t even hear it” Watters joked.
427,‘You Wouldn’t Even Have A Country Left’: Trump Accuses ‘LameStream Media’ Of Trying To Keep Country Closed To Ruin His Election,Shelby Talcott,The Daily Caller,2,https://dailycaller.com/2020/03/25/donald-trump-attacks-media-reelection-coronavirus/,President Donald Trump attacked “The LameStream Media” Wednesday on Twitter and during a press question and answer session at the White House.Trump tweeted earlier Wednesday accusing the media of wanting him “to keep our Country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success.”The president further addressed this attack during a press event at the briefing room after a reporter asked if his timeline to re-open the country amid the novel coronavirus by Easter was “based on your political interests.”The reporter said that “lawmakers and economists on both sides of the aisle have said that re-opening the country by Easter is not a good idea” and asked Trump what the plan was “based on.”“And I don’t know if that’s so but I do think it’s so that there are people in your profession that would like that to happen. I think it’s very clear” the president continued. Trump continued to add to his earlier attack accusing multiple reporters in the room of writing “fake news.” He said that certain journalists would “love to see” him fail during the 2020 election.“The media would like to see me do poorly in the election” Trump replied. “Just so you understand are you ready? I think there are certain people that would like it to not open so quickly I think there are certain people that would like it to do financially poorly because they think that would be very good as far as defeating me at the polls.”“I think it’s very clear that there are people in your profession that write fake news” Trump said. “You do she does. There are people in your profession that write fake news. They would love to see me for whatever reason because we’ve done one hell of a job — nobody’s done the job that we’ve done. And it’s lucky that you have this group here right now for this problem or you wouldn’t even have a country left.”

Ralph Northam criminalized gatherings of more than 10 people even if they’re attending a religious service.The Democrat announced Monday that effective Tuesday at midnight “all public and private in person gatherings of 10 or more individuals are prohibited” in the state of Virginia. Guidance issued by the governor’s office regarding the order notes that religious institutions are not excluded from this order.Northam’s announcement is further expanded in Executive Order 53 which placed temporary restrictions on restaurants recreational and entertainment gatherings and non-essential retail businesses as well as closed K-12 schools throughout the state due to the coronavirus pandemic. “Virginians are strongly encouraged to seek alternative means of attending religious services such as virtually or via ‘drive-through’ worship” the guidance says. “Places of worship that do conduct in-person services must limit gatherings to 10 people to comply with the statewide 10-person ban.”Violation of this order will be considered a Class 1 misdemeanor. In Virginia a Class 1 misdemeanor is punishable by confinement in jail for up to 12 months and a fine of up to $2500 or both. Northam’s office did not respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer a Democrat amended her order that banned gatherings of more than 50 people saying that churches were excluded from being subject to penalties for violating the order. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine a Republican also exempted churches from his state’s stay-at-home order.“We did not order religious organizations to close but my message to EVERYONE is that this is serious. When you are coming together whether in a church or wherever – this is dangerous” DeWine tweeted Sunday.

To meet the criteria for release these inmates must be over 70 years old imprisoned for nonviolent crimes and have less than a year left to serve.“We want to identify anyone in those categories and get them released immediately” the Democratic mayor said adding that it would take several days to process their release.He continued: “Some have many months some have only a few months some have only weeks but I’m going to treat this category across the board.”The Rikers Island Prison complex is seen from an airplane in the Queens borough of New York City New YorkThe Rikers Island Prison complex (foreground) is seen from an airplane in the Queens borough of New York City New York U.S. April 2 2017.

New York has by leaps and bounds the most number of positive cases and deaths from the disease with more than 25600 reported cases and 218 deaths.California for comparison has reported the second highest number of cases with 2644 people having tested positive for the virus along with 52 deaths. Washington state — while third behind California in total number of cases — has the second-highest number of coronavirus-related deaths with 123 who have passed away from the disease.

430,Nevada Governor Bars Anti-Malaria Drugs For Outpatient Coronavirus Treatment,Mary Margaret Olohan,The Daily Caller,2,https://dailycaller.com/2020/03/25/nevada-anti-malaria-drugs-coronavirus-sisolak-chloroquine/,The governor of Nevada barred the use of anti-malaria drugs for outpatient treatment after President Donald Trump said the medication could potentially be used as treatment for COVID-19.Democratic Nevada Gov. Stephen Sisolak signed an emergency order Tuesday barring the use of the anti-malaria drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for treating coronavirus patients who have not been admitted to a hospital. The order includes an explicit exception allowing a “chart order for an inpatient in an institutional setting” Sisolak’s Communications Director Ryan McInerney told the Daily Caller News Foundation.“In other words doctors in hospitals and emergency rooms can still prescribe these drugs to treat a patient diagnosed with COVID-19 if they so choose” McInerny said. “The regulation focuses on outpatient services where there has been evidence of hoarding of these drugs which can impact those who need the drugs for other conditions AND COVID-19 patients in hospital settings where a doctor could determine that administering those drugs might be helpful.”The governor reasoned that neither experts nor Nevada doctors have a consensus on whether the drugs can treat coronavirus patients according to The Associated Press.His order came just days after Trump announced that the Federal Drug Administration is waiving “outdated rules and bureaucracies” to test various “anti-viral therapies” that might combat the virus. This includes the malaria drugs.

Cases of COVID-19 continue to rise in the United States with New York's case count doubling every three days according to governor Andrew Cuomo. (Photo by Doug Mills-Pool/Getty Images)(Photo by Doug Mills-Pool/Getty Images)“It’s shown very encouraging early results and we’re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately” the president said. “And that’s where the FDA has been so great.”The FDA reports that studies are underway to “determine the efficacy in using chloroquine to treat COVID-19.”“The FDA has been working closely with other government agencies and academic centers that are investigating the use of the drug chloroquine which is already approved for treating malaria lupus and rheumatoid arthritis to determine whether it can be used to treat patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 to potentially reduce the duration of symptoms as well as viral shedding which can help prevent the spread of disease” the FDA said in a March 19 statement according to an FDA press release.FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn M.D. said: “We also must ensure these products are effective; otherwise we risk treating patients with a product that might not work when they could have pursued other more appropriate treatments At the same time we will engage with domestic manufacturers to ramp up production of this product to mitigate any potential supply chain pressures.”“If clinical data suggests this product may be promising in treating COVID-19 we know there will be increased demand for it” Hahn added. “We will take all steps to ensure chloroquine remains available for patients who take it to treat severe and life-threatening illnesses such as lupus.”A nationwide shortage of the drugs is reportedly spurred by doctors prescribing the medication for themselves and for their families ProPublica reported.“It’s disgraceful is what it is. And completely selfish” Executive director of the Illinois Pharmacists Association Garth Reynolds told the publication. The Illinois Pharmacists Association began receiving emails and calls from members Saturday who said they were receiving questionable prescriptions ProPublica reported.Reynolds said the IPA has begun efforts to urge doctors against this.“We even had a couple of examples of prescribers trying to say that the individual they were calling in for had rheumatoid arthritis” he said. “I mean that’s fraud.”

Bernie Sanders and 2020 presidential candidate on Wednesday threatened that he will put a hold to the Senate coronavirus package unless there are stronger sanctions on a $500 billion corporate welfare fund.“Unless Republican Senators drop their objections to the coronavirus legislation I am prepared to put a hold on this bill until stronger conditions are imposed on the $500 billion corporate welfare fund” Sanders said in a statement on Twitter.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell confirmed early Wednesday morning that a bipartisan deal for a nearly $2 trillion emergency relief package to address the coronavirus pandemic had been reached.

432,Biden Super PAC Ad Accuses Trump Of Failure In Handling Coronavirus Spreads ‘Hoax’ Claim,Mary Margaret Olohan,The Daily Caller,2,https://dailycaller.com/2020/03/25/misinformation-biden-super-pac-coronavirus-covid19/,A super PAC ad supporting 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden accused President Donald Trump of failure concerning the coronavirus pandemic.The seven-figure ad created by pro-Biden Unite the Country PAC will reportedly run nationally on select broadcast and cable programs except for Fox News. “Crisis Comes” discusses past crises that the United States has experienced referencing how former Presidents Barack Obama George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan handled them. “Crisis comes to every presidency — we don’t blame them for that” the ad said. “What matters is how they handle it.” (RELATED: Former Vice President Joe Biden Keeps Pushing Misinformation About Coronavirus. Here Are 5 Examples)“Donald Trump didn’t create the coronavirus but he is the one who called hoax who eliminated the pandemic response team and who let the virus spread unchecked across America” the ad continued. “Crisis comes to every president — this one failed.”The ad accused Trump of calling “hoax” on the coronavirus a debunked claim that has been highly disputed since POTUS compared Democratic criticism of the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak to Democratic efforts to impeach him.“This is their new hoax” the president said.“What the president is trying to do is to balance the public health issues with the fact that this is having an enormous impact on the economy of the country which may actually indirectly even cause a considerable amount of harm and difficultly even health wise” Fauci said during a Tuesday interivew on WMAL’s “Mornings on the Mall” with Mary Walter and Vince Coglianese.He added: “So it’s a delicate balancing act which the president is trying to get it right and we’re under very intense discussions right now about what the most appropriate timeline is and if we do modify it how we modify it.”Unite the Country PAC did not respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation.The ad avoids directly saying that Trump called the coronavirus a hoax a false claim that Politifact rated “false” and that Biden himself has spread.“Crisis Comes” accused Trump of eliminating the pandemic response team — a claim that is rated as true but also disputed among former National Security Council members.Former National Security Council director Beth Cameron said in a Washington Post op-ed that Trump closed the office unnecessarily but former NSC senior director for counter proliferation and biodefense Tim Morrison suggested Cameron’s argument is a Democratic political narrative.“It is true that the Trump administration has seen fit to shrink the NSC staff. But the bloat that occurred under the previous administration clearly needed a correction” he continued.“One such move at the NSC was to create the counterproliferation and biodefense directorate which was the result of consolidating three directorates into one given the obvious overlap between arms control and nonproliferation weapons of mass destruction terrorism and global health and biodefense” the former NSC senior director wrote in a Washington Post op-ed.He added: “It is this reorganization that critics have misconstrued or intentionally misrepresented. If anything the combined directorate was stronger because related expertise could be commingled.”The ad also said the president has “let the virus spread unchecked across America.” But Biden’s own response to the pandemic is to encourage Americans to “listen to the doctors.”“Listen to what they have to say” Biden said Tuesday on ‘The View.’ “I would respectfully suggest that you should have Dr. [Anthony] Fauci on a lot more than the president — or anyone who’s not an expert like Fauci — laying out exactly what’s going on.”Dr. Fauci has praised the Trump administration’s handling of the coronavirus crisis on multiple occasions calling the Trump administration both “very positive” and “multifaceted.”
433,These States Say Abortions Must Be Halted During The Coronavirus Pandemic,Mary Margaret Olohan,The Daily Caller,2,https://dailycaller.com/2020/03/25/states-ban-abortion-coronavirus-covid19/,Several states deemed abortion procedures non-essential or ordered that they must cease during the pandemic.Health departments under Republican governors in Texas and Ohio as well as the governor of Mississippi said abortions should stop during the coronavirus outbreak.“Those who violate the governor’s order will be met with the full force of the law” said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.As state health departments ban medical procedures that use Personal Protective Equipment during the coronavirus pandemic several state health departments deemed abortions to be non-essential or ordered that they cease during the outbreak.Democratic governors in New York Washington and New Jersey have deemed abortion an “essential” procedure. (But health departments under Republican governors in Texas and Ohio as well as the governor of Mississippi said the procedures are non-essential and must be banned in order to reserve Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for fighting coronavirus.PPE can include respirators eye protection hearing protection protective clothing gas masks gloves overalls boots and googles according to the CDC.TexasTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton declared Monday that abortion providers “must postpone all surgeries and procedures that are not immediately medically necessary” pursuant to an executive order from Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott. The order took effect immediately and will be in place at least until April 21.“Failure to comply with an executive order issued by the governor related to the COVID-19 disaster can result in penalties of up to $1000 or 180 days of jail time” the AG’s office said in a press release. Paxton added: “We must work together as Texans to stop the spread of COVID-19 and ensure that our health care professionals and facilities have all the resources they need to fight the virus at this time. No one is exempt from the governor’s executive order on medically unnecessary surgeries and procedures including abortion providers. Those who violate the governor’s order will be met with the full force of the law.”Abortion clinics and groups condemned Paxton’s actions saying that abortion access is essential.“There are many reasons women decide to have an abortion in the already limited time window state law allows and a delay means denying them the constitutional right to make those decisions in a safe timely manner with the help of their doctors” Texas Freedom Network president Kathy Miller said in a statement.Amy Hagstrom Miller who is president of Whole Women’s Health and Whole Women’s Health Alliance operating three Texas clinics as well as facilities in other states said abortion is “essential” and “time-sensitive.”“Many of our patients travel hundreds of miles across the state for care and some even travel across state lines to access abortion. Additionally our patients are subjected to mandatory delays and multiple medically-unnecessary visits – all of which already delay timely care” she told the DCNF on Wednesday.She added: “Emergency actions during a global pandemic should advance health and safety for us all not force people to delay much needed care and possibly exacerbate their health situations by doing so. Patients cannot wait until this pandemic is over to receive safe abortion care.”MississippiMississippi Gov. Tate Reeves announced Tuesday that the only abortion clinic in the state Jackson Women’s Health Organization must stop performing abortions due to the Mississippi Department of Health’s temporary ban on all elective medical procedures and non-essential medical visits during the pandemic.“We’ll take whatever action we need to protect the not only the lives of unborn children but also the lives of anyone who may contract this particular virus” he told reporters according to the Clarion Ledger. ” … I don’t know any specifics so I’m not saying they are currently operating. I just simply don’t know … We’ll take whatever necessary actions.”He added: “We’re doing everything in our power and have for many years to make Mississippi the safest place in America for unborn children.”He also said he would take “additional action” against the Jackson Mississippi clinic if it continues to perform abortions.Dr. Thomas Dobbs a state health officer said during the Tuesday news conference with the governor that he was not familiar with Reeves’s promise.“And before I would make any comments I think we have to review the situation a bit more” he added according to the Clarion Ledger.The Mississippi Department of Health did not yet respond to a request for comment from the DCNF as to whether the state will ban abortions.An unnamed employee at the abortion clinic Jackson Women’s Health Organization told the DCNF the clinic is open but will not be performing abortions on Wednesday for the rest of the week or for the foreseeable future until given direction by the government. Jackson Women’s Health Organization will follow government direction the employee said.She refused to give a name directed the DCNF to the clinic’s communications team and ended the call. The same employee refused to connect the DCNF with the clinic’s communications team when the DCNF called an additional time and said the clinic declined to comment.OhioOhio Gov. Mike DeWine announced March 17 that the Ohio Department of Health would postpone elective surgeries and procedures that use PPE. The order went into effect March 18.Following the order Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost sent Friday letters to the Women’s Med Center in Dayton and Planned Parenthood of Southwest Ohio’s Cincinnati Surgery Center ordering the abortion clinics to stop providing any services that require personal protective equipment Ohio attorney general spokeswoman Bethany McCorkle told the DCNF on Saturday.Preterm employee Fiona Thomas confirmed to the DCNF on Monday morning that the Cleveland clinic would not stop performing abortions despite a Wednesday order from the ODH and a Friday letter from Attorney General Dave Yost.Following the DCNF’s report on the matter press secretary Melanie Amato said in a Monday evening statement to the DCNF that the ODH “has been made aware of allegations that some health care providers appear to have violated the order on performing non-elective procedures.” “When ODH is made aware of allegations that medical facilities are not being complied with ODH’s order ODH is asking the Ohio Attorney General’s Office to issue cease and desist orders” Amato said. “These orders have started going out.”“This is now an enforcement issue” she added.Amato told the DCNF on Wednesday morning that there are no updates on the situation.Others Might FollowThe Louisiana Department of Health announced March 21 that all licensed health care facilities in the state postpone all medical and surgical procedures until further notice (unless to treat an emergency medical condition). The measure is intended to preserve PPE and “to utilize hospital staffing equipment and bed capacity” for the transition to the COVID-19 emergency.The Louisiana Attorney General directed the DCNF to the Louisiana Department of Health which has not yet responded to a request for comment.Mississippi Department of Health (MSDH) spokeswoman Liz Sharlot told the DCNF Wednesday evening that MSDH has put out recommendations that elective procedures which would not negatively impact a patient should be suspended.“It is up to each facility and healthcare provider to determine whether a procedure is elective or non-elective” Sharlot said.
434,Cuomo Questions Quarantine: ‘Probably Not The Best Public Health Strategy’,Amanda Prestigiacomo,The Daily Wire,2,https://www.dailywire.com/news/cuomo-questions-quarantine-probably-not-the-best-public-health-strategy,On Thursday Democratic Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo publicly questioned the full-quarantine measures his state implemented nearly two weeks ago.The Democrat mused during a presser that quarantining everyone might have actually led to infections of the elderly as young people were forced to live in close quarters with older folks.“We closed everything down. That was our public health strategy” Cuomo said as reported by the New York Post. “If you re-thought that or had time to analyze that public health strategy I don’t know that you would say ‘Quarantine everyone.’”“I don’t even know that that was the best public health policy” the governor admitted. “Young people then quarantined with older people [it] was probably not the best public health strategy. The younger people could have been exposing the older people to an infection.”When the Post inquired about Cuomo’s public quarantine-questioning his office directed the outlet to an article posted in The New York Times opinion section by Dr. David Katz last Friday. At a press conference on Monday the Post noted Cuomo specifically referenced Dr. Katz when similarly questioning quarantine measures.“There’s a theory of risk stratification that Dr. Katz who’s at Yale University is working on which is actually very interesting to me” the governor said Monday. “Isolate people but really isolate the vulnerable people. Don’t isolate everyone because some people most people are not vulnerable to it.”“And if you isolate all people you may be actually exposing the more vulnerable people by bringing in a person who is healthier and stronger and who may have been exposed to the virus right” Cuomo added.Dr. Katz piece titled “Is Our Fight Against Coronavirus Worse Than the Disease?” illustrated that the damage being caused to the economy in anti-coronavirus efforts as “possibly graver than the direct toll of the virus itself.”“I am deeply concerned that the social economic and public health consequences of this near total meltdown of normal life — schools and businesses closed gatherings banned — will be long lasting and calamitous possibly graver than the direct toll of the virus itself” Katz argued. “The stock market will bounce back in time but many businesses never will. The unemployment impoverishment and despair likely to result will be public health scourges of the first order.”“Worse I fear our efforts will do little to contain the virus because we have a resource-constrained fragmented perennially underfunded public health system” the doctored added. “Distributing such limited resources so widely so shallowly and so haphazardly is a formula for failure. How certain are you of the best ways to protect your most vulnerable loved ones? How readily can you get tested?”Still Cuomo has yet to throw out any timeline with regard to quarantine policy change. Currently all so-called nonessential business is closed. In fact the only dates Cuomo has thrown out were in reference in continuing quarantine measures and they have been extreme ranging up to nine months.
435,Rogue Republican Threatens To Hold Up Emergency Relief Bill; Trump Unloads: ‘Third Rate Grandstander’,James Barrett,The Daily Wire,2,https://www.dailywire.com/news/rogue-republican-threatens-to-hold-up-emergency-relief-bill-trump-unloads-third-rate-grandstander,On Friday the House took up the COVID-19 emergency relief bill belatedly passed by the Senate late Wednesday night after Democratic delays. But while the Democrats were to blame for the hold up in the Senate a maverick Republican congressman is now threatening to hold up its passage in the House. Responding to the development President Trump unloaded on the “third rate grandstander.”“The senate did some voodoo just like with Obamacare” Rep.

The House is just as responsible for killing the origination clause as the Senate.

The congressman “set the House on edge by threatening to try to force a roll call vote. Party leaders had hoped to pass the measure by voice vote without lawmakers having to take the risk of traveling to Washington” the outlet explains.In response to Massie’s eleventh-hour stunt Trump unloaded online.“Looks like a third rate Grandstander named [Rep.

He can’t stop it only delay which is both dangerous [and] costly. Workers [and] small businesses need money now in order to survive. Virus wasn’t their fault. It is ‘HELL’ dealing with the Dems had to give up some stupid things in order to get the ‘big picture’ done. 90% GREAT! WIN BACK HOUSE but throw Massie out of Republican Party!”“By empowering the Radical Left Democrats do nothing Kentucky politician [Rep.

436,Gov. Gavin Newsom Announces Five Major Banks Won’t Collect Mortgage Payments From Those Affected By Coronavirus Quarantine,Ashe Schow,The Daily Wire,2,https://www.dailywire.com/news/gov-gavin-newsom-announces-five-major-banks-wont-collect-mortgage-payments-from-those-affected-by-coronavirus-quarantine,California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Wednesday that five major U.S. banks will temporarily suspend home mortgage payments for people who have been affected by the coronavirus quarantine.The Associated Press reported that Wells Fargo U.S. Bank Citi and JP Morgan Chase would “defer mortgage payments for three months” and that state “chartered banks and credit unions will offer similar deferrals.”“I thought the Great Recession was overwhelming and we really had to react. This one is much bigger” Diana Dykstra CEO of the California-Nevada Credit Union League told the AP. “People’s health is on the line it’s deeper and broader than that crisis was. It was a housing crisis. This is a crisis for everyone.”Bank of America the fifth bank was criticized by Newsom for allegedly agreeing to only defer mortgage payments for one month but spokesman Bill Halldin told the AP the 30-day time frame was not a limit and that they company would consider further delaying payments depending on how long the crisis lasts.Newsom the AP reported also explained that more than 1 million Californians have “1 million Californians have filed for unemployment benefits since March 13 as businesses shut down or dramatically scaled back because of a statewide ‘stay-at-home’ order to prevent the spread of the virus.” More than 3 million Americans across the country have filed for unemployment benefits during that time meaning California alone accounts for a third of the total number.Newsom also said the Golden State is increasing its supply of medical equipment protective gear and hospital beds. In a press conference on Sunday President Donald Trump announced that California would receive four large medical stations with 2000 beds and help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as well as the help of a U.S. Navy hospital ship on the coast near Los Angeles. The president also said he would be sending thousands upon thousands of respirators surgical masks face shields coveralls and gloves to the state.California would further be helped by the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill passed by congress this week. As The Daily Wire previously reported the bill amounted “to some $2.2 trillion in relief measures including $1200 checks to most American adults (and another $500 for most children) a $500 billion loan program for struggling businesses cities and states nearly $400 billion for employee-retention funds for small businesses and another $130 billion for hospitals among other provisions.”The bill would also expand unemployment benefits increasing weekly benefits by up to $600 on top of what is already provided by states meaning someone in California could receive up to $1000 a week in unemployment benefits in addition to the one-time $1200 checks that would be passed out to American adults. The bill is expected to pass the House of Representatives soon. Democrats had previously blocked a bill that would bring relief for middle-class families while introducing their own bill loaded with left-wing demands that had nothing to do with the coronavirus crisis.
437,Gallup Finds Biggest Loser In COVID-19 Response Is The Media,James Barrett,The Daily Wire,2,https://www.dailywire.com/news/gallup-finds-biggest-loser-in-covid-19-crisis-is-the-media,A new Gallup study gauging the American public’s view of the handling of the coronavirus crisis by various entities and figures found one particular group earning particularly bad marks: the news media which was the only one on the list of nine that did not have majority approval.“Americans are generally positive in their evaluations of how each of nine leaders and institutions has handled the response to the coronavirus situation” Gallup explains. “Eight of the nine receive majority positive ratings — led by U.S. hospitals at 88% approval. Only the news media gets a more negative than positive review.”The news media was rated far worse than the CDC Vice President Mike Pence President Donald Trump and even Congress all of which had strong majority approval.Asked “Do you approve or disapprove of the way each of the following is handling the response to the coronavirus in the U.S.?” Americans gave by far the worse assessment of the news media. Here is the breakdown from best to worst:U.S. hospitals: 88% approve 10% disapproveYour child’s school or daycare: 83 – 9Your state government: 82 -17Your employer: 82 – 14Government health agencies such as the CDC and NIH: 80 -17Vice President Mike Pence: 61-32President Donald Trump: 60 – 38Congress: 59 – 37The news media: 44 – 55Gallup explains that the data was collected from March 13-22 Gallup poll “with the field period starting on the same day President Donald Trump declared a national emergency over the coronavirus outbreak and spanning sharp increases in the number of documented cases in the U.S. as well as the number of deaths.”Trump’s 60% approval Gallup notes is higher than his overall job approval which is 49% which climbed 5 points from a few weeks ago when it was 44%.A large part of the negative response to the news media comes from Republicans only 25% of whom said they approve of how it’s covering the crisis while 61% of Democrats approved.According to Gallup’s survey President Trump is winning this particular round of his years-long battle with the news media which he hammered once again this week. In a tweet Wednesday Trump accused the media of attempting to “keep our Country closed as long as possible” for political purposes.“The LameStream Media is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our Country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success” he tweeted Wednesday. “The real people want to get back to work ASAP. We will be stronger than ever before!”Trump’s tweet came the same day as Dr. Deborah Birx the White House Coronavirus Response coordinator called out exaggerated reporting on the coronavirus pandemic.“I think the numbers that have been put out there are actually very frightening to people” Dr. Birx said during a press conference on Wednesday. “But I can tell you if you go back and look at Wuhan and Hubei and all of these provinces when they talk about 60000 people being infected even if you said alright well there’s asymptomatics and all of that so you get to 600000 people out of 80 million. That is nowhere close to the numbers that you see people putting out there. I think it has frightened the American people.”
438,Rogan Blasts Biden: Skin ‘Pulled Tight Like A Lizard’ ‘Trump Going To Eat Him Alive’,Ryan Saavedra,The Daily Wire,2,https://www.dailywire.com/news/rogan-blasts-biden-skin-pulled-tight-like-a-lizard-trump-going-to-eat-him-alive,Podcast host Joe Rogan unloaded on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden during a recent broadcast of his show predicting that President Donald Trump was “going to eat him alive.”“You have to be able call out s**t that’s wrong on your side” Rogan began. “And this is one of the problems that the Democratic Party is having right now with this Joe Biden guy. You guys gotta be able to call it out you can’t let this slide because everybody else see’s it and Trump is going to eat him alive. He’s going to eat that guy alive.”“The guy can barely remember what he’s talking about while he’s talking” Rogan continued.Regarding videos that show Biden struggling to talk or remember events Rogan said “Play any of them they’re all crazy. Every video of him recently talking he’s stumbling through s**t he forgets what he’s talking about.”Rogan then proceeded to show recent highlights from much-criticized interviews that Biden had on MSNBC and ABC.“He doesn’t know what he’s talking about when he’s talking” Rogan said. “He doesn’t look good either. And they got makeup on him. His skin is all pulled tight like a lizard.”The video clips that Rogan played on his show went viral this week on social media.During an interview on ABC’s “The View” Biden struggled to make a coherent statement about curing the coronavirus saying “We have to take care of the cure that will make the problem worse no matter what.”During an interview on MSNBC Biden tried to attack Trump saying “Why doesn’t he just act like a president. That’s a stupid way to say it– sorry.”“Go ahead” Wallace responded.“No no it’s probably best I don’t” Biden responded.Rogan ripped into Biden earlier this month after the candidate said “We hold these truths to be self-evident all men and women created by go you know the you know the thing.”“Stop. Pause. He can’t be president” Rogan responded. “Stop. Pause. Pause. Listen we can’t play any games here folks. This is a really old man who can’t talk. This is not a joke. Like that right now ‘you know the thing’ play that again. This should get you into a mental hospital. They should be like ‘Hey um Joe are you alright?’”Biden’s Democrat rivals have also called his fitness for office into question during the primary contest.After one of the debates then-candidate Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) criticized Biden over concerns that he couldn’t “carry the ball” telling CNN “I think we are at a tough point right now because there’s a lot of people concerned about Joe Biden’s ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling. And I think that Castro had really legitimate concerns about can he be someone in a long grueling campaign … and has every right to call out.”“I think there were a lot of moments where a number of us were looking on the stage when he tends to go on sometimes” Booker continued. “At one point he was talking about communities like mine listening to record players. I don’t remember the last time I saw a record player … But there are definitely moments where you listen to Joe Biden and you just wonder …”
439,Ocasio-Cortez Attacks Republicans Over Stimulus Bill That Every Democrat Voted For,Ryan Saavedra,The Daily Wire,2,https://www.dailywire.com/news/ocasio-cortez-attacks-republicans-over-stimulus-bill-that-every-democrat-voted-for,Socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) has repeatedly attacked Senate Republicans over the massive $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill which provides relief to American families and protects the economy even though every Senate Democrat also voted for the bill.The 880-page bill was passed 96-0 with four Republican Senators not being able to vote because they were self-quarantining over the coronavirus outbreak.The Washington Post reported:The bill would extend $1200 to most American adults and $500 for most children create a $500 billion lending program for businesses cities and states and a $367 billion employee retention fund for small businesses. It would direct $130 billion to hospitals and provide four months of expanded unemployment insurance among other things.Lawmakers and the White House were bombarded with lobbyists and special interest groups seeking assistance during the negotiations and the price tag rose from $850 billion to $2.2 trillion in just a matter of days.Ocasio-Cortez responded to the bill’s passage in the Senate by attacking only Republicans even though every Democrat in the Senate also voted for it.“Just a reminder that there is absolutely no good reason why Senate Republicans are tying a historic corporate giveaway to getting relief money in the hands of families” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “They could just authorize sending checks to families today right now & deal with the rest. But they refuse.”“To clarify $1200 checks are ONLY going to some w/social sec numbers NOT immigrants w/ tax IDs (ITINs). Thanks to GOP these checks will be cut off the backs of *taxpaying immigrants* who get nothing. Many are essential workers who pay more taxes than Amazon. Wall St gets $4T” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “What Trump + Senate GOP have done is hold hospitals working people and the vulnerable hostage so they could get in $500 billion (that will be leveraged into $4T) in corporate welfare. Without the Wall St giveaway GOP refuses to fund hospitals & unemployment. It’s inhumane.” Ocasio-Cortez continued “Republicans put more strings and means-testing on single parents and struggling mom + pops than they do on multibillion dollar corporations that don’t pay taxes.” “The cruise industry registers as foreign companies to avoid paying US taxes. Now they want US bailout money. Now the same Republicans who say immigrants who pay US taxes shouldn’t get help are bending over backwards to give 🤑 to foreign companies who DON’T pay taxes. Insane” Ocasio-Cortez continued. “GOP really pulling for a hat trick of corruption classism and racism all in one policy move here.”

In Italy the mortality rate was over 10% through Thursday; in Spain roughly 8%; in Iran 7.6%; in France almost 6%. The current rate in the United States is 1.5% and there is mounting evidence that many more people may be infected across the nation which would drop the mortality rate even further.Conservative commentators pilloried Ioffe for her comment:Katie Pavlich✔@KatiePavlichIf you needed anymore evidence these people hate America ---> https://twitter.com/juliaioffe/status/1243297913863835648 …Julia Ioffe✔@juliaioffeWho's the shithole country now? https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/world/coronavirus-news.html …24396:32 PM - Mar 26 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy786 people are talking about thisArthur Schwartz✔@ArthurSchwartzThe left and their media partners are rooting for the virus.

Ioffe stated “I think this president one of the things that he really launched his presidential run on is talking about Islamic radicalization. And this president has radicalized so many more people than ISIS ever did. I mean the way he talks the way he — the way he —”“That is it’s unconscionable for you to say that” commentator David Urban responded.Ioffe continued “The way that he talks the way that he allows these — the way he winks and nods to these groups. The way he says ‘I know I’m not supposed to say it but I’m a nationalist.’ The way that he hems and haws when he has to condemn these people gritting his teeth says says ‘fine OK I condemn this.'”Ioffe tweeted “And a word to my fellow American Jews. This president makes this possible. Here. Where you live. I hope the embassy move over there where you don’t live was worth it.”In December appearing on CNN with host Don Lemon there was this exchange:Lemon: So Julia let me ask you. Let’s take a step back here then. So this meeting with Trump and (Russian Foreign Minister) Lavrov even have happened today? Did the Russians do anything to earn this?Ioffe: “Well yeah they helped him win the presidency. Right? If you’re Trump you’ve earned it. And in fact the Ukrainians who have been dying for a White House visit haven’t earned it. They haven’t meddled in the elections the way Trump has asked them to. So they didn’t do what was asked of them. I think it’s telling that Lavrov got a White House meeting for no reason the day that Trump’s impeachment — articles of impeachment are announced.”She continued:Last time Lavrov was in the White House it was the day after he fired Comey and he told the Russians you know I fired him over this Russia thing. Also here’s some super classified Israeli intelligence that you just might want to see.And you know we still don’t know what happened in that hour that he was in the White House. And I have a feeling in the coming days and weeks we’re going to be finding out that Trump said some pretty — again I’m speculating but if last time was anything to go by given that Trump hasn’t changed I’m guessing we’re going to learn that Trump said some pretty eyebrow-raising things.
441,Texas Roadhouse CEO To Donate ‘Salary And Bonus’ To ‘Front-Line Employees’ During COVID-19 Crisis,Frank Camp,The Daily Wire,2,https://www.dailywire.com/news/texas-roadhouse-ceo-donates-salary-and-bonus-to-front-line-employees-during-covid-19-crisis,On Wednesday MarketWatch reported that W. Kent Taylor the CEO of steak restaurant chain Texas Roadhouse had decided to “forgo his base salary and bonus from the pay period starting March 18 through Jan. 7 2021” and redirect that money “to pay front-line workers.”The move comes as businesses across the country are struggling to stay afloat while the COVID-19 pandemic burns through the nation. The virus has led many states and localities to close all non-essential businesses and ask that residents stay at home in a bid to slow down the spread and “flatten the curve.”While many restaurants have been allowed to continue takeout and delivery services table service has been shut down in many states severely limiting revenue.The Daily Wire reached out to Texas Roadhouse corporate for comment and received the following reply from Vice President of Communications Travis Doster:Kent Taylor has always said that Texas Roadhouse is a people-company that just happens to serve great steaks. The donation of his salary and bonus to help front-line employees is the embodiment of that saying. We are proud to have such a selfless leader who considers “Roadies” to be family.In a message on the official Texas Roadhouse homepage Taylor writes:While we realize that many people are struggling right now I want to take a moment to let you know what Texas Roadhouse is doing to help. We are open for business and still serving America even though many of our dining rooms are temporarily closed…In the areas where our dining rooms are closed we are ramping up our To-Go and Curbside services and we are also turning some of our parking lots into temporary drive-thrus to serve our regular menu. We are rolling out Family Value Packs as well so stay tuned to your local Texas Roadhouse for more information.The bottom line is these are challenging times and we are all in this together. We will continue to do our best to adapt to your needs and help support every community we serve in a safe way. Thank you again for your loyalty to Texas Roadhouse.COVID-19 which originated in China’s Hubei province has infected nearly 530000 people worldwide and led to more than 23900 deaths according to data from Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) Global Cases map. 122150 people have recovered.In the state of Indiana where the steakhouse chain was founded there have been 645 confirmed cases of COVID-19 leading to 17 deaths according to the Indiana State Department of Health.On Monday Indiana Governor Eric J. Holcomb issued a “Stay at Home” order for the state.The text of the order reads in part:With exceptions as outlined below all individuals currently living in the state of Indiana are ordered to stay at home or their place of residence except as allowed in this Executive Order.Under the “Essential Businesses and Operations” category section (n) titled “Restaurants for Consumption Off-Premises” the order notes an exemption for certain cases: “Restaurants bars taverns and other facilities that prepare and serve food but only for consumption off-premises through such means as in-house delivery third-party delivery drive-through curbside pick-up and carry out. The in-person dining prohibition shall be enforced under and pursuant to the process described in Executive Order 20~10.”
442,Obama Admin Allegedly Depleted Federal Stockpile Of N95 Masks Never Replaced Reports Say,Ryan Saavedra,The Daily Wire,2,https://www.dailywire.com/news/obama-admin-allegedly-depleted-federal-stockpile-of-n95-masks-never-replaced-reports-say,The Obama administration significantly depleted the federal stockpile of N95 respirator masks to deal with the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009 and never rebuilt the stockpile despite calls to do so according to reports.The reports come amid attacks on the Trump administration by some state and local officials along with some in the media who suggest that Trump is responsible for a shortage of N95 respirator masks.“Alex Azar secretary of HHS told Congress last month that the stockpile contains 30 million surgical masks and 12 million of the more protective N95 masks” Bloomberg News reported. “He said there were an additional 5 million N95 masks that may have passed their expiration date.”“The national stockpile used to be somewhat more robust. In 2006 Congress provided supplemental funds to add 104 million N95 masks and 52 million surgical masks in an effort to prepare for a flu pandemic” Bloomberg News continued. “But after the H1N1 influenza outbreak in 2009 which triggered a nationwide shortage of masks and caused a 2- to 3-year backlog orders for the N95 variety the stockpile distributed about three-quarters of its inventory and didn’t build back the supply.”The Los Angeles Times reported that “a safety-equipment industry association and a federally sponsored task force both recommended that depleted supplies of N95 respirator masks which filter out airborne particles be replenished by the stockpile which is maintained by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.”Charles Johnson president of the International Safety Equipment Association told the Times “Our association is unaware of any major effort to restore the stockpile to cover that drawdown.”The Trump administration activated the Defense Production Act in case more equipment is needed but has not actually put it to use because the administration says that private companies have stepped up to the plate to start manufacturing equipment that is needed.3M announced late last week:Since the COVID-19 outbreak 3M has doubled its global output of N95 respirators to an annual rate of over 1.1 billion per year or nearly 100 million per month globally.In the U.S. 3M currently manufactures more than 400 million N95 respirators annually which is increasingly being directed to support both government and public health response. The company also manufactures respirators at locations in Europe Asia Pacific and Latin America.In addition 3M is increasing its investments primarily in the U.S. to expand its global capacity by over 30 percent in the next 12 months.The company is also maximizing production of a wide range of other products used in the COVID-19 response globally including hand sanitizers disinfectants and filtration solutions as the pharmaceutical industry works to find a vaccine to fight the virus.Mike Roman 3M chairman and chief executive officer said “This pandemic is affecting us all and we are doing all we can to support public health and especially our first-responders and those impacted by this global health crisis. We are mobilizing all available resources and rapidly increasing output of critical supplies healthcare workers in the United States and around the world need to help protect their lives as they treat others.”
443,Dr. Fauci: Private Sector Saved Us On Testing Govt ‘System’ Can’t Handle It,Amanda Prestigiacomo,The Daily Wire,2,https://www.dailywire.com/news/dr-fauci-private-sector-saved-us-on-testing-govt-system-cant-handle-it,"Dr. Anthony Fauci the nation’s leading infectious diseases expert explained Thursday during a open discussion with NBA player Steph Curry that the government “system” caused the delay in coronavirus testing praising the private sector for stepping up and taking over.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was unable to keep up with the pace for the amount of tests necessary for effective COVID-19 testing Dr. Fauci explained suggesting the government simply cannot be expected to outperform the private sector in this regard.“We have hundreds of thousands of tests that are out there now mostly because we got the private sector involved of the companies who know how to make it well make large amounts” the doctor told Curry explaining the initial lag in testing.Later in the stream Curry again pressed Dr. Fauci on what exactly was holding up the COVID-19 testing. “What are the things inhibiting those [the tests] being accessible to the masses?” he asked.“Well there should be nothing now that’s inhibiting it” Fauci responded. “But originally the system the way it was set up Steph was not geared to this kind of massive capability of instantaneously safely getting a test getting it done in a really good period of time – not days and days but hours.”“Right now the system is changed predominately because it’s being handed over to the commercial firms who know how to do it” the doctor continued. “It started off as a public health measure from the CDC it now needs to be and is being handed of to the commercial group.”Dr. Fauci has had a key role in advising President Donald Trump on the China-originated novel coronavirus and keeping the public informed that is when news organizations allow the vital Trump press briefings to be played on their platforms.Unfortunately the media have been trying to drive a wedge between the doctor and Trump at least that’s what Fauci has suggested.“I would wish that that would stop because we have a much bigger problem here than trying to point out differences” Fauci stressed during a radio interview Tuesday The Daily Wire noted. “When I have made recommendations he’s [Trump] taken them; he’s never countered or overridden me; the idea of pitting one against the other is just not helpful. I wish that would stop and we’d look ahead at the challenge we have to pull together to get over this thing.”During the same interview Fauci praised the president for his move to implement a limited travel ban from China and then Europe though the move was criticized from some on the Left including presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden.“In moments like this this is where the credibility of a president is most needed as he explains what we should and should not do” Biden blasted Trump at the time. “This is no time for Donald Trump’s record of hysteria and xenophobia hysterical xenophobia to uh and fear mongering”WATCH:Elizabeth Harrington✔@LizRNCDr. Fauci: Govt testing system was inadequate private sector made difference""Hundreds of thousands of tests are out there now..because we got private sector involved""The system is changed predominately because it's being handed over to commercial firms who know how to do it""Embedded video"
444,Tucker Carlson: NY's leaders more worried at first about being called racist than coronavirus threat,Carlson Tucker,Fox News Opinion,2,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/tucker-carlson-nys-leaders-more-worried-at-first-about-being-called-racist-than-coronavirus-threat,"You see what's happening in New York. The question is why is the coronavirus outbreak so especially devastating there?New York City is the densest metro area in the country. That's the most obvious answer -- probably the biggest problem. The city also has an awful lot of people traveling to and from other infected countries and that's significant too.NYC EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN: CORONAVIRUS CASES RISING WE NEED 'MORE OF EVERYTHING'But it's not the whole story. As this deadly virus that emerged from Eastern China and began to spread inexorably across the globe clearly headed here? Leaders in New York not only failed to shield their citizens from it they took affirmative and aggressive steps to increase the risk to their population.Why would they do that? Well because they were worried far more about being called racist than protecting human lives.That's not an overstatement. That's not hyperbole. Watch the city's health commissioner Oxiris Barbot urge New Yorkers to spend as much time as possible in crowded public places.Keep in mind this video was from February 2nd of this year. That was long after the threat from the Chinese coronavirus was obvious to anyone who was paying attention.Oxiris Barbot New York City Health Commissioner: The risk to New Yorkers for coronavirus is low and our preparedness as a city is very high. There is no reason not to take the subway not to take the bus not to go out to your favorite restaurant and certainly not to miss the parade next Sunday. I'm going to be there.""Take the subway. Go to dinner."" People cheer. They feel good about themselves. Future generations though are going to watch that video with their jaws open in disbelief. How could someone charged with protecting public health so recklessly endanger it?They will watch this performance from State Sen. John Liu too. Liu suggested that people who might be concerned in any way about contracting a deadly disease or who might be interested in where it came from must be -- and you guessed it -- bigots.Leaders in New York not only failed to shield their citizens from it they took affirmative and aggressive steps to increase the risk to their population.State Sen. John Liu D-N.Y.: But there's really no need to panic and to avoid activities that we always do as New Yorkers. We are hardy people. As an Asian-American I've been somewhat disturbed if not outright appalled at some of the comments or gestures that I have seen. Diseases originate from anywhere or from particular places in the world.In other words as a member of a protected interest group I'm ordering you to ignore this threat to your family on moral grounds. Go to the parade or else. That's what Liu was saying.Let's hope that in the wake of this disaster -- after John Liu has lost his job and we can all think clearly again -- people will stop talking this way in public for good. It was always the most brutal form of social control masquerading as sensitivity and caring.Now we know it was infecting the public with disease. But at the time sentiments like this were universal among big city public officials. State Sen. Brian Kavanagh for example decided to embark on a crusade against what he called misinformation -- a euphemism as it so often is for accurate information.Kavanagh encouraged people to head to Chinatown for a festival.State Sen. Brian Kavanagh D-N.Y.: It's very important that we recognize that this holiday and this festival is of tremendous significance for many communities in our state. And it is very important that we ensure that we don't have misinformation and many in the media have been covering this issue as if it's you know a terrible plague that people have to avoid.""If you don't go to a crowded public place immediately you're racist."" Look at those people telling you that demanding that you do that. Hectoring you badgering you exerting moral blackmail on you to expose yourself.By early March coronavirus was clearly becoming a major problem in the United States. But for elected officials in New York the only problem was their constituents' racist worries about staying alive.On March 2nd -- this March 2nd -- Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeted this: ""Since I'm encouraging New Yorkers to go on with your lives plus get out on the town despite coronavirus I thought it would offer some suggestions. Here's the first. Thru Thursday go see ""The Traitor."" If ""The Wire"" was a true story plus set in Italy it would be this film.""That's right go to a movie theater immediately. You must.A week later de Blasio was still encouraging New Yorkers to live it up and mingle in large groups. On March 11th which keep in mind was barely two weeks ago de Blasio was still insisting that ""If you're not sick you should be going about your life.""Tucker Carlson Tonight - Thursday March 26VideoThat very same day the NBA announced it was suspending its whole season. Italy was already several days into a national lockdown. But the mayor of one of the world's most crowded cities was telling everyone to carry on and so the Chinese coronavirus was just a racist myth.Soon after that people in New York inevitably started to get sick in some cases very sick. In some cases they died. And then suddenly de Blasio was on ""Meet the Press"" shrieking that Donald Trump had abandoned the city. It was their fault. It's all their fault.That line almost always works which is why de Blasio did it. The media play along and move on to the next thing and no one remembers what actually happened.Will that happen this time? Maybe not. This time might be different. This pandemic is too horrible. Too many people are getting hurt. Nobody really liked identity politics anyway."
445,Lara Trump: Trump's handling of coronavirus crisis shows America what real leadership looks like,Lara Trump,Fox News Opinion,2,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/lara-trump-trump-is-showing-america-what-real-leadership-looks-like,"Our country is facing a challenging time. Americans are feeling anxious about their health fear of what lies ahead and sadness for what has been lost as a result of COVID-19. Yet as Americans we are resilient when we face adversity and during this time we have seen the great spirit of Americans helping each other.Unprecedented times call for a strong leader. My father-in-law President Trump is showing what leadership looks like in a time of crisis. He is taking bold and historic steps to combat COVID-19.While Democrats and the media were obsessing over impeachment the president took early and effective actions to stop the spread of coronavirus. He ordered travel restrictions on China and Europe and restricted our southern and northern borders. Less than a month after learning of the virus the CDC began working on a vaccine. By March the president announced that the first potential vaccine entered a ""phase on""e trial breaking records for the speed it moved Save as Draftto trials.TRUMP CAMPAIGN OFFICES TO STAY CLOSED THROUGH APRIL BECAUSE OF CORONAVIRUSWhile these scientific developments were taking place the president and the administration led efforts to support states small businesses jobs and American families. They’ve waived interest rates on federally held student loans and afforded borrowers the option to suspend payments. They have prioritized the health care of our most vulnerable veterans and deployed tens of thousands of masks gowns and other medical devices to states in need.Sadly while your president is hard at work Democrats are playing politics with people’s lives. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif. and her fellow Democrats spent their efforts adding completely unrelated agenda items to the economic stimulus package which slowed down negotiations in Congress. At a time when Americans are vulnerable jeopardizing the security of the country as well as blocking much-needed help is reckless and wrong. President Trump is focused on keeping America great and his campaign is still hard at work to reelect him this November. As part of our digital efforts we are hosting a variety of virtual surrogate events training thousands of supporters online and activating our massive volunteer network to make calls on behalf of the president. I hosted a Women for Trump virtual panel to talk about our campaign efforts to stay connected during this time.On the other hand the weak Democratic front-runner Joe Biden is missing in action and his record shows how ineffective his response was to the swine flu — he lacks leadership vision and strength. Biden can barely hold a video conference and is spending more time criticizing the president than helping with solutions.Every American can be confident that the president's top priority is to keep our families safe and healthy. When we defeat COVID-19 in the United States our president is the one leader who will ensure that our economy will come roaring back.Together we will continue our fight for America work for President Trump’s reelection and look forward to the victories that lie ahead."

Chuck Schumer's lead congressional Democrats degenerated to class warfare to justify their obstruction calling the bill a corporate bailout and slush fund that would not protect workers.

Conservatives have long believed these progressive proposals -- mandatory early voting mail-in ballots (which would allow ballots to be marked behind closed doors) same-day registration and legalized ballot harvesting -- are aimed at manipulating election outcomes and facilitating voter fraud.These measures have consistently failed but Pelosi and company figured that with a gun to Republicans' heads they would cave to avoid being perceived as uncompassionate.

Solve the problem at hand.""How can Democrats still get by with their professions of compassion when they can't tie their shoes without injecting politics into their shoelaces? How dare they hold this relief bill hostage for items that have nothing to do with the crisis or assisting those suffering from it while otherwise claiming to support it?CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPThis stunt showcases the level of extremism choking the reason out of the Democratic Party. Likely Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden's shameless support of these Green New Deal provisions puts the lie to the notion that he is a moderate alternative to some of the more extreme leftist Democratic candidates.One can hope for more bipartisanship in tackling this pandemic and its surrounding economic devastation but that can only happen if we decouple from relief bills the less urgent problems unrelated to the crisis. So far congressional Democrats have resisted that which in a sane world would come back to bite them in November."
447,Max Lucado: Coronavirus anxiety -- You can't control the circumstances but here are 4 things to do,Max Lucado,Fox News Opinion,2,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/coronavirus-anxiety-max-lucado,"In times like these it is easy to let fear grip our hearts. Fear of sickness. Fear of loss. Fear of the unknown. But when fear and anxiety try to invade our every thought there is a C.A.L.M. that comes only from God.If you wonder about your ability to fight fear remember there is a pathway out of the valley of worry. God used the pen of Paul to sketch the map with the most underlined verse in the Bible.Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say rejoice! Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is at hand. Be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Finally brethren whatever things are true whatever things are noble whatever things are just whatever things are pure whatever things are lovely whatever things are of good report if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy — meditate on these things (Phil. 4:4–8).MAX LUCADO: A CORONAVIRUS PRAYER – 'DO IT AGAIN LORD'A person would be hard-pressed to find a more practical powerful and inspirational passage on the topic of anxiety. The passage has four key points that spell out the word CALM to help you remember.C = Celebrate God’s goodness. “Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say rejoice!” (Phil. 4:4). Turn your attention away from the problem and for a few minutes celebrate God. It does you no good to obsess yourself with your trouble. The more you stare at it the bigger it grows. Yet the more you look to God the quicker the problem is reduced to its proper size. This was the strategy of the psalmist:I will lift up my eyes to the hills—From whence comes my help?My help comes from the LordWho made heaven and earth (Ps. 121:1–2).Do you see the intentionality in those words? “I will lift up my eyes.” Do not meditate on the mess. You gain nothing by setting your eyes on the problem. You gain everything by setting your eyes on the Lord.Max Lucado: Coronavirus anxiety and fear – How to interrupt the downward spiralVideoIs God sovereign over your circumstances? Is he mightier than your problem? Does he have answers to your questions? According to the Bible the answer is yes yes and yes.Rejoice in the Lord. This is step one. Do not hurry past it. Face God before you face your problem. Then you will be ready.A = Ask God for help.“Let your requests be made known to God” (Phil. 4:6). Fear triggers either despair or prayer. Choose wisely.God said “Call on me in the day of trouble” (Ps. 50:15 ).Jesus said “Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and it will be opened to you” (Matt. 7:7). There is no uncertainty in that promise. No “might” “perhaps” or “possibly will.” Jesus states unflinchingly that when you ask he listens.Don’t let anxious negative thoughts take over your mind. You cannot control the circumstances but you can always control what you think of them.So ask! When anxiety knocks on the door say “Jesus would you mind answering that?” Reduce your request to one statement. Imitate Jesus who taught us to pray “Give us this day our daily bread” (Matt. 6:11). Engage in specific prayer. And engage in promise-based prayer. Stand on the firm foundation of God’s covenant. “Let us then approach God’s throne of grace with confidence” (Heb. 4:16 ).Having done so:L = Leave your concerns with God.Let him take charge. Let God do what he is so willing to do: “Guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus” (Phil. 4:7).Have you ever left an appliance at the repair shop? You tried to fix it but had no success. So you took it to the specialist. You explained the problem and then:offered to stay and help fix it;hovered next to the workbench asking questions about progress;threw a sleeping bag on the floor of the workshop so you could watch the repairman work.If you did any of these things you don’t understand the relationship between client and repairman. The arrangement is uncomplicated. Leave it with him to fix it. Our protocol with God is equally simple. Leave your problem with him.God does not need our help counsel or assistance. (Please repeat this phrase: I hereby resign as ruler of the universe.) When he is ready for us to reengage he will let us know.Until then replace anxious thoughts with grateful ones. God takes thanksgiving seriously.Here’s why: gratitude keeps us focused on the present.More from OpinionMax Lucado: A coronavirus prayer – 'Do it again Lord'Max Lucado: Coronavirus anxiety and fear – How to interrupt the downward spiralAnne Graham Lotz: Coronavirus -- A Sunday message in a time of crisisJim Daly: Where is God during the coronavirus pandemic?We worry about the past — what we said or did. We worry about the future — tomorrow’s assignments or the next decade’s developments. Anxiety takes our attention from the right now and directs it “back then” or “out there.”But when you aren’t focused on your problem you have a sudden availability of brain space. Use it for good.Meditate on good things.“Finally brethren whatever things are true whatever things are noble whatever things are just whatever things are pure whatever things are lovely whatever things are of good report if thereis any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy — meditate on these things” (Phil. 4:8).Don’t let anxious negative thoughts take over your mind. You cannot control the circumstances but you can always control what you think of them.Celebrate. Ask. Leave. Meditate. C.A.L.M.Could you use some calm? We could all use a word of comfort and God is ready to give it. It is not God’s will that you lead a life of perpetual anxiety. He has made you for more than this season of breath-stealing angst and mind-splitting worry.With His help you can sleep better tonight. You can reframe the way you face your fears. By His power you can “be anxious for nothing” and discover the “peace … which passes all understanding.""CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPDear LordYou spoke to storms. Would you speak to ours? You calmed the hearts of the apostles. Would you calm the chaos within us? You told them to fear not. Say the same to us. We are weary from our worry battered from the gales of life. Oh Prince of Peace bequeath to us a spirit of calm. Quench anxiety. Stir courage. Let us know less fret and more faith."

The question is why is the coronavirus outbreak so especially devastating there?New York City is the densest metro area in the country. That's the most obvious answer -- probably the biggest problem. The city also has an awful lot of people traveling to and from other infected countries and that's significant too.NYC EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN: CORONAVIRUS CASES RISING WE NEED 'MORE OF EVERYTHING'But it's not the whole story. As this deadly virus that emerged from Eastern China and began to spread inexorably across the globe clearly headed here? Leaders in New York not only failed to shield their citizens from it they took affirmative and aggressive steps to increase the risk to their population.Why would they do that? Well because they were worried far more about being called racist than protecting human lives.That's not an overstatement. That's not hyperbole. Watch the city's health commissioner Oxiris Barbot urge New Yorkers to spend as much time as possible in crowded public places.Keep in mind this video was from February 2nd of this year. That was long after the threat from the Chinese coronavirus was obvious to anyone who was paying attention.Oxiris Barbot New York City Health Commissioner: The risk to New Yorkers for coronavirus is low and our preparedness as a city is very high. There is no reason not to take the subway not to take the bus not to go out to your favorite restaurant and certainly not to miss the parade next Sunday. I'm going to be there.""Take the subway. Go to dinner."" People cheer. They feel good about themselves. Future generations though are going to watch that video with their jaws open in disbelief. How could someone charged with protecting public health so recklessly endanger it?They will watch this performance from State Sen. John Liu too. Liu suggested that people who might be concerned in any way about contracting a deadly disease or who might be interested in where it came from must be -- and you guessed it -- bigots.Leaders in New York not only failed to shield their citizens from it they took affirmative and aggressive steps to increase the risk to their population.State Sen. John Liu D-N.Y.: But there's really no need to panic and to avoid activities that we always do as New Yorkers. We are hardy people. As an Asian-American I've been somewhat disturbed if not outright appalled at some of the comments or gestures that I have seen. Diseases originate from anywhere or from particular places in the world.In other words as a member of a protected interest group I'm ordering you to ignore this threat to your family on moral grounds. Go to the parade or else. That's what Liu was saying.Let's hope that in the wake of this disaster -- after John Liu has lost his job and we can all think clearly again -- people will stop talking this way in public for good. It was always the most brutal form of social control masquerading as sensitivity and caring.Now we know it was infecting the public with disease.

449,Newt Gingrich: Coronavirus challenges us to recover our physical and economic health – Here is what we can do,Newt Gingrich,Fox News Opinion,2,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/coronavirus-health-economy-newt-gingrich,As the coronavirus pandemic intensifies some in the news media would like to pit economic recovery against public health. They write and talk as if you can have one or the other – but not both.This is a profound misunderstanding of the necessary connection between healthy Americans and a healthy economy.Public health measures and economic growth and prosperity measures can be adjusted like a thermostat rather than a light that can be turned on or off with a switch. They can be moved to different intensities based on need.AHEAD OF CORONAVIRUS STIMULUS VOTE HOUSE LAWMAKERS CONCERNED REP. MASSIE MAY TRIGGER DELAYEven in the direst health emergency a large part of the economy must function. Without electricity water sewage trucked-in supplies groceries etc. the entire health system would collapse. The loss of life would be far greater.And even with a booming economy there are public health aspects – including safe food medicine effective emergency drugs and a host of other elements – that we blend to help Americans have healthy lives with good jobs.The challenge today is how we blend the best of public health with the best of economic growth so we can have an America that is both healthy and prosperous.This essay outlines a series of questions and proposals that may help enhance the decision-making process and bring the health and economic teams into a productive win-win dialogue about implementation.CUOMO: NOT SURE IF CLOSING ALL BUSINESSES KEEPING EVERYONE HOME WAS 'THE BEST PUBLIC HEALTH STRATEGY'We need an integrated health-economy policy goal so the country can see the public health and economic teams working synergistically.The two teams can help solve each other’s challenges and work through the values and judgment questions that are inevitable. The mission statement should be something like: “The Trump administration is committed to growing the American economy and putting Americans back to work within a framework of saving lives through the aggressive campaign to defeat the coronavirus.”This would enable America to – as rapidly as possible – get back on the track of historically low unemployment and jobs for everyone. Part of the public health equation must be stemming the loss of lives and the health costs that will come from continued unemployment in suicide alcoholism drug addiction depression and other human responses to economic despair. The best example of a pure V-shaped decline and recovery is James Grant’s “The Forgotten Depression: 1921: The Crash That Cured Itself.”The Coronavirus Task Force led by Vice President Mike Pence has been doing an amazing job.The task force has coordinated a national and in some cases international response to a suddenly emerging pandemic. Thousands of lives have already been saved because of the aggressiveness and competence of the task force team.Drs. Deborah Birx and Anthony Fauci have become household celebrities as a result of their obvious competence and professionalism. The daily briefings have restored a great deal of confidence that the crisis is being handled competently.A similar Task Force for Economic Recovery Job Creation and Prosperity needs to be established. In coordination with the public health-focused task force this new team should focus every day on reopening the economy solving bottlenecks and developing policies for more rapid dynamic economic growth.A special focus should be built around keeping senior citizens as safe as possible.Home health companies which already have trained people providing in-home testing should be utilized so fewer seniors have to go to the doctor’s office. We should develop an intense program of teaching seniors to use telemedicine – both for convenience and to minimize visiting potentially dangerous offices. Working with companies such as Amazon Walmart Peapod and others home delivery for drugs and groceries should be optimized so seniors can minimize time in settings where they might encounter the coronavirusThe public health-focused task force should explore what we can do in the economy instead of only looking at what we can’t do.For example using an inkblot strategy developed for defeating insurgencies we could focus on reviving the economy of the least-threatened states. As of this writing there are eight states with fewer than 100 people infected with the coronavirus: South Dakota North Dakota West Virginia Wyoming Alaska Nebraska Montana and Hawaii. In those states there could be entire counties with zero infections.Surely a strategy could be developed to focus on the infected and liberate the healthy in those eight states – while keeping people safe from the risk of infection. New York state with more than 37000 cases must be severely constrained for the moment. But most of America is not New York and doesn’t have to be.In fact many rural counties (even in New York) could perhaps be treated with more openness because they resemble South Dakota more than New York City or neighboring Westchester County.As Americans go back to work they need to know a lot more about staying safe and about doing their jobs in a biologically more dangerous world.A system of routine checks must be developed that will apply virtually everywhere – and for as long as the coronavirus threatens us.I was in South Korea during the first phase of the coronavirus outbreak. Even then every hotel had someone at the door who checked the temperature (with a skin responsive thermometer) of every person who walked in. High temperature meant no admission. Thermometers may ultimately be as important as tests for the coronavirus.Early openings for restaurants in low-threat areas could come with a protocol that only a limited number of tables could be filled at a time to ensure physical distancing. It could also require that staff and customers had to have their temperatures checked. Thinking through behavioral protocols that allow public health experts to say “yes” is a key part of accelerating economic recovery.Big companies may be able to work with the public health community to develop healthy protocols for their employees and customers.If Walmart Target Costco McDonald’s CVS the major grocery stores etc. all developed sound protocols for checking on the virus and for keeping people safe a significant part of the American economy could begin to reopen almost everywhere except in the most infected areas. These processes should be quickly documented and shared so smaller businesses that don't have the resources to develop such practices can replicate them.More emphasis needs to be put on therapies.We may eventually get to a vaccine (and like the flu it might have to be redeveloped annually as the coronavirus mutates). However in the short run we can save a lot of lives by simply adapting existing therapies already approved for human use and developing new therapies as they are discovered.Two keys will be finding some method of validating when off-label use of existing therapies works and then getting the knowledge of those therapies to the physician community as rapidly and thoroughly as possible. If we could reduce the threat of the COVID-19 disease to manageable illness rather than death we would have a lot more latitude to open the economy and get back to job creation.Therapies may be able to be applied in the next 30 to 60 days with dramatic improvements in survivability.Americans are going to have to learn a lot to live in this new world.The coronavirus may disappear for the summer but come back in the fall. As Americans go back to work they need to know a lot more about staying safe and about doing their jobs in a biologically more dangerous world.As the new therapies testing and other capabilities come online Americans need to learn about them. The faster we learn the healthier we will be and the more we can open up the economy.One example of the need for learning is the use of telemedicine by senior citizens. A combination of public service announcements by trusted celebrities (for the Medicare population actors Tom Selleck or Gary Sinise would be good examples) and online learning needs to be used.For those Americans who must stay home a lot of learning can take place online. This can improve their lives at home prepare them for working from home (the new economy will almost certainly have more distance work than the old economy) and help them use best practices as we learn more about the coronavirus.We are watching an enormous experiment in distance learning with many schools closed. This system must be built upon because people need knowledge about new testing systems therapies rules for reopening the economy and lessons about staying safe as you go back to work. The Pence team should establish an electronic learning working group with advisers like Sebastian Thrun of Udacity and Brandon Busteed of Kaplan.Unlocking a locked-up and closed-down economy is a lot more complicated than simply increasing the incentives in an otherwise healthy functioning economy.It is probably worthwhile to convene experts on the World War I and World War II demobilization efforts to learn what lessons there are to relaunch a domestic economy after a period of massive government intervention. The objective legitimate requirements of public health are going to make renewing the American economy a lot more complicated than anything we have done in the last 75 years.It might be worth studying those who had to disentangle the government and private sector and relaunch a robust economy to see if those lessons learned can be applied to our project of a healthy America with a healthy economy.This essay is just a start. More ideas must be developed. Keeping Americans healthy and prosperous right now is our society’s most critical challenge.

And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif. should be his first suspect.Like a retailer charging $75 for a $5 bottle of Purell Pelosi hogtied Congress for nearly an entire week in a despicable bid for windfall political profits even as thousands of Americans lay sick and hundreds died.TRUMP DOWNPLAYS WORST-CASE CORONAVIRUS SCENARIOS: 'I DON'T BELIEVE YOU NEED 40000 OR 30000 VENTILATORS'The Senate seemed poised to pass a bipartisan $2 trillion COVID-19 relief bill last Sunday to provide medical and economic assistance to Americans who through no fault of their own are being terrorized by the coronavirus – a killer microbe now on a rampage from sea to shining sea.But when Nervous Nancy jetted from San Francisco into Washington all hell erupted.Pelosi unveiled a 1404-page measure and importuned Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York to brandish its provisions as the cost for House approval of any Senate coronavirus bill.BRIT HUME CALLS NANCY PELOSI'S CORONAVIRUS BRIEFING 'NERVE-RACKING': SHE'S 'NOT ALWAYS COHERENT'In other words as COVID-19 – the disease caused by the coronavirus – damaged the lungs of American citizens and the U.S. economy Pelosi hiked the price of House votes for a bill to cure and comfort 330 million of her countrymen.Pelosi’s scandalous misbehavior was stunningly ideological. A USA Today headline called her bill “liberal Christmas in March.”Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky dubbed it “a left-wing episode of Supermarket Sweep.” Pelosi’s proposal was clogged with fantasy items seemingly concocted in the Oberlin College faculty lounge:$35 million for the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.$300 million for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.Debt forgiveness for the U.S. Postal Service.Tax credits for solar panels and windmills.Emissions regulations for airlines.Guaranteed seats for Big Labor on corporate boardsNew rules on “the diversity of depository institutions.”Corporate information requirements on “work-life balance initiatives.”Corporate reporting mandates on employees’ “gender race and ethnic identity.”Comparative statistics on company pay “amongst racial and ethnic minorities (and to the extent possible results disaggregated by ethnic group) as compared to their white counterparts” and “between men and women for similar roles and assignments.”Scarier still Pelosi’s micromanaging bill would have made her America’s precinct captain in chief.Starting with this November’s election Pelosi wanted every state that accepted COVID-19 relief money to guarantee at least 14 days of early voting; absentee ballots mailed to all registered voters whether requested or not; a ban on voter ID cards; prohibition of notarization or witness signatures to authenticate absentee ballots; free return postage on such ballots; and self-sealing envelopes for same.Pelosi’s ransom note included “ballot harvesting” whereby one person may submit absentee ballots on behalf of relatives friends and God knows whom else. Furthermore states “may not put any limit on how many voted and sealed absentee ballots any designated person can return.” What could go wrong?Pelosi also demanded same-day voter registration so people could walk into the polls on Election Day and sign up and vote. Gone would be any time to verify a person’s identity residency or (rather important) U.S. citizenship. If Americans must endure eligibility-confirming waiting periods before buying guns why prohibit similar intervals before casting ballots?All of this selfish Democratic foolishness cremated crucial time while COVID-19 never even napped.“The answer from our friends on the other side of the aisle is delay delay delay” übermoderate Sen. Susan Collins R-Maine complained. “No sense of urgency no hurry.”“In the United States as of this morning there were 471 deaths reported due to coronavirus” a disgusted Senator Ted Cruz R-Texas told his colleagues Monday. “As of right now it’s 573. That means today 102 Americans died while the Democrats were blocking consideration of this bill.”Even the so-called “Paper of Record” exposed the villains in this tragicomedy. “Democrats block $1.7 trillion stimulus bill” explained the New York Times headline Sunday.Of course since those words embarrassed the party of which this propaganda rag is a dangling appendage this truth proved unfit to print. So that online headline swiftly became “Democrats block $1.7 trillion stimulus bill citing worker concerns.” But even that too accurately pinned blame right where it belonged.So the Old Gray Lady declared Republicans and Democrats equally responsible for inaction: “Partisan Divide Threatens Deal on Rescue Plan.”Pelosi then had the raging chutzpah Tuesday to threaten that the House would block the Senate bill “if it has poison pills in it.” Never mind that her legislation was laced with arsenic.After public revulsion the Senate late Wednesday considered a compromise purged of Pelosi’s excesses although some pro-union goodies and $25 million for the Kennedy Center survived negotiations. This bill passed 96-0. The House weighs in Friday.While the left excoriates President Trump’s early COVID-19 response when this disease’s course and effects were unclear liberals remain as silent as Manhattan’s streets are now about Democrats’ unforgivable sloth this week now that COVID-19’s epidemiological and economic devastation is obvious in vivid hideous living color.Absent Pelosi and filibustering Senate Democrats’ sabotage this relief could have cleared Congress Sunday. Even assuming House passage Friday Democrats will have extended America’s pain for five days.For COVID-19 patients desperate for ventilators this needless delay could spell the difference between respiration and asphyxiation.Democratic exploitation of America’s suffering would invite criminal scrutiny if Pelosi and Schumer gouged the price of face masks. But since they gouged the price of their colleagues’ yeas and nays federal prosecutors are powerless. However come November Americans voters should give Democrats the full dose of justice that they deserve.
451,Adriana Cohen: Coronavirus shows dangerous US dependence on Chinese drugs and medical supplies must end,Adriana Cohen,Fox News Opinion,2,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/adriana-cohen-americas-dangerous-dependence-on-china-must-change,"The coronavirus pandemic that's crashing the U.S. economy putting lives at risk and derailing our entire way of life should serve as a wake-up call that the U.S. government must stop being reliant on China and other foreign nations for prescription drugs medical supplies or any supply chain product or ingredient that's essential to our survival.It's also a matter of national security. If members of the U.S. military and those who support our armed services don't get access to PPE (personal protective equipment) life-saving drugs and other necessities during a pandemic -- and succumb to it as a result -- we're putting our nation's security at risk from foreign adversaries who could exploit the situation.""Medicines can be used as a weapon of war against the United States"" Rosemary Gibson a senior adviser on health care issues at the bioethics-focused Hastings Center and co-author of ""China Rx: Exposing the Risks of America's Dependence on China for Medicine"" warned lawmakers last year. ""Supplies can be withheld. Medicines can be made with lethal contaminants or sold without any real medicine in them rendering them ineffective"" reported Politico.CHINA TEMPORARILY BARS ENTRY FROM FOREIGN VISITORS AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMICIt's no secret that the United States is dangerously dependent on China for a bevy of medicines Americans rely on such as antibiotics ibuprofen penicillin and acetaminophen.""Eighty percent of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients are produced abroad the majority in China and India; however the FDA only inspected one in five registered human drug manufacturing facilities abroad last year"" Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley R-Iowa wrote in a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and the FDA last year.Grassley also warned about the risks that come with foreign manufacturing of pharmaceuticals: ""I strongly encourage the administration's demonstration projects to include unannounced inspections in foreign manufacturing facilities to determine whether they meet the required Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients and drug quality and safety standards to include sufficient record-keeping testing and protections against counterfeiting.""Given we know that China is responsible for the start of COVID-19 and its subsequent mishandling and cover-up causing irreparable harm to the United States Europe and the globe is this who we want controlling our critical medical supply chain?Absolutely not.Nor do we want to be reliant on any other foreign nation for potentially life-saving drugs or medical equipment such as masks gloves ventilators or other critical products. This includes India whose government has just announced it is banning exports of a malaria drug hydroxychloroquine that we're told may be helpful in treating patients with coronavirus.That said the Trump administration and Congress must make it a high priority to work alongside the private sector to dramatically ramp manufacturing here at home.The future of this country is at stake and there's simply no time to waste."
452,Leslie Marshall: Coronavirus through eyes of a doctor's wife – remember true heroes of this fight,Leslie Marshall,Fox News Opinion,2,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/leslie-marshall-coronavirus-through-eyes-of-a-nyc-doctors-wife-remember-true-heroes-of-this-fight,My husband Dr. Asghar Husain is an orthopedic surgeon. That means he fixes broken bones. He specializes in shoulder elbow and knee injuries. He not only takes care of professional athletes but also children who fall off their bunk bed older people who fall down and the usual weekend warriors.For my husband and most orthopedic surgeons the majority (90 percent in my husband’s case) of the surgeries he performs are elective. With the urgency of this coronavirus pandemic hospitals have recently asked surgeons to stop doing all elective surgeries.There are two reasons for that: 1) there aren’t enough supplies like masks and gloves to go around and 2) there are no beds if a patient operated on needs one; all are taken (and are running out fast) for patients infected with the coronavirus.DAVID JEREMIAH: IN CORONAVIRUS CRISIS THERE'S A LOT WE CAN'T DO. HERE ARE 3 THINGS WE CAN DO.My husband had to phone the majority of his patients last week and tell them he could not operate on them for injuries such as torn rotator cuffs meniscus and ACLs. Most of the patients were understanding but some who are in pain are worried about waiting 30 days for surgery.My husband is currently considered a second line physician in this battle against coronavirus. The first or front line are the doctors and nurses who come into contact with coronavirus patients daily. But to show you how fast this virus is spreading my husband was asked just this week when (not if according to the hospital) some of the front line either become infected or need or be quarantined would he be willing to come up to the front line.My husband said yes of course. He not only took an oath but he and other doctors in the medical community believe this is a societal issue and they have a responsibility to help stop the spread of this virus and to care for those who are suffering and who might eventually die from it.When my husband told me this of course I was concerned. Not only for him but for my children. He thinks it could happen in the next two or three weeks. We discussed him living at the hospital or one of the hotels near the hospital that has been provided for healthcare workers so they can remain away from their families while working on the front line.I asked my husband how he feels about this virus and the situation we are in and he said one of the most frustrating things for medical personnel is not only how fast this virus spreads but also how long it lives on surfaces outside the body and once inside the body how it attacks the cells. He also shared with me recently an email from a doctor in Italy; the man sounded so despondent it was heartbreaking.Coronavirus is not just a medical issue for the medical community it’s also a financial one. People aren’t paying their co-pays or deductibles (hospitals and doctors offices aren’t required to collect them during this time if patients can’t pay). Ninety percent of surgeries aren’t being performed. Many hospitals doctors nurses EMT’s techs and other medical personnel are working with reduced or even no pay. Many are volunteering their time like the health care professionals who have come out of retirement to assist with the burden this virus has currently placed on our healthcare system and its workers.That means these people are working tirelessly risking their lives for all of us daily and some of them aren’t getting paid. They fear to lose their savings their retirement or even their homes in the process. When I hear about a bailout for the airline industry I get it. But where is the bailout for the health care industry? For health care workers!?Looking at China and South Korea we know that someday we will all be on the other side of this virus. When that happens I hope all of you remember the true heroes in this fight against COVID-19. It’s not politicians but scientists nurses volunteers techs paramedics EMTs physician’s assistants and doctors like my husband who made that all possible. I hope you never forget that America. This doctor’s wife never will.
453,Zachery Bryan: Coronavirus has hit Hollywood's working class families too -- and they're worried,Zachery Bryan,Fox News Opinion,2,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/zachery-bryan-during-coronavirus-shutdown-separate-elites-rest-of-hardworking-hollywood,Like me you probably saw the video compilation of celebrities singing John Lennon’s “Imagine” in response to the global pandemic. Of course in very quick fashion the video was parodied as people reacted against another example of an out-of-touch Hollywood. Americans have become all too familiar with celebrities making shallow gestures toward the people across this country that they usually hold in contempt.But during a recent conversation with a longtime friend who works in the entertainment industry she expressed concern that if the coronavirus shutdown goes on too long they won’t be able to make their monthly housing payment. It was a reminder that Hollywood just like the rest of the country is filled with support and service work positions. Jobs that you can’t do from home. Like millions of others these are the folks that run the risk of suffering the most from the economic fallout of COVID-19.  VICTOR DAVIS HANSON: TRUMP CAN DEFEAT CORONAVIRUS SAVE ECONOMY AND TURN DISASTER INTO AN AMERICAN VICTORYAs a child actor I had the amazing opportunity to grow up in the entertainment industry moving from Colorado to California to pursue my dream.My acting career brought me name recognition through playing the eldest son Brad on the hit series “Home Improvement.” I later moved on to acting in other TV shows like “E.R.” and “Cold Case” and played roles in various feature films like “The Fast & The Furious: Tokyo Drift” and starred opposite Gerard Butler in “The Games of Their Lives.”Needless to say I received a unique and invaluable education. Although I saw firsthand the elitist and cutthroat nature of Hollywood that it’s known for I’ve also had the opportunity to work with some amazing people. They are everyday Americans who come from all over the country to pursue their dreams in entertainment. These people are the engine that makes Hollywood run.While A-list celebrities can’t help using their award show speeches to mock anyone that doesn’t hold to their elitist views the dirty little secret is that they represent the elite 1 percent of Hollywood. The rest of the people in the entertainment industry are everyday folks living paycheck to paycheck and struggling to make a living wage.I’m passionate that during an unprecedented crisis like we are seeing with COVID-19 the hardworking folks of Hollywood don’t get forgotten or dismissed with the celebrities and their feel-good video compilations. These celebrities would all benefit from moving from in front of the camera to behind it. I know because I experienced that firsthand transitioning from actor to the launch of my own production company Lost Lane Entertainment. That change has given me the opportunity to work behind the scenes with the Americans who are in the trenches. It’s a great privilege for me as someone who came from middle America to create alongside those who work hard to care for their families and pursue their dreams. These are the men and women who come in at dawn and are still there hours after dusk when the celebrities and their entourages have left.Like Americans in any other industry they are the backbone of Hollywood the ones who make sure things get done.That’s why I’m passionate that during an unprecedented crisis like we are seeing with COVID-19 the hardworking folks of Hollywood don’t get forgotten or dismissed with the celebrities and their feel-good video compilations.I understand if you get frustrated during times like this with the political statements or tone-deaf actions of the celebrities. I do too. But please be sure to separate the 1 percent of Hollywood from the 99 percent that represents the hardworking everyday Americans who like everyone else across this amazing country are scared about losing their job figuring out how to provide for their family and cheering on all the people who are at battle with this unseen enemy. 
454,Media Peddle Bogus Wuhan Virus Stats To Bash America,Mollie Hemingway,The Federalist,2,https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/27/media-peddle-bogus-wuhan-virus-stats-to-bash-america/,When Donald Trump tweeted this week that the United States had performed more coronavirus tests than any other country the media were upset.Trump being Trump he’d also said the United States had done more tests in eight days than South Korea had done in eight weeks. PolitiFact calculated the United States had done 17582 fewer tests than South Korea during that time period. LiveScience said the United States had done 43790 fewer tests than South Korea during that time period.Their own disparity notwithstanding other media outlets pointed out merely that South Korea is a much smaller country than the United States. That meant they had done more tests per capita than the United States had.“Trump overlooks a huge piece of context” a USA Today fact check said. CNN went with “Fact Check: US has done more coronavirus tests than South Korea but not per person.” MSNBC ran a segment with a graph asserting that “The U.S. Trails Other Countries In Number Of Other Coronavirus Tests Conducted Per Million People.”The segment is utterly wild incidentally. You can watch it here but while Mika Brzezinski moans and grunts in agreement Joe Scarborough accuses the president of “lying” and says you have to adjust for population because of “science.” As if speaking to Trump he says “This is science. I don’t know … maybe you didn’t take … science at whatever school your daddy got you into. I don’t know. But this is just science.”While the media have been doing a demonstrably bad job covering the coronavirus and the administration — and have the sinking poll numbers to prove it — this is a good point. Numbers should be placed in context. Comparing countries of different size by aggregate numbers isn’t particularly helpful.Yet that’s what happens all the time. For example just a couple of hours after Scarborough’s “science” rant his colleague Chuck Todd began his show by comparing the United States’s coronavirus cases with Italy’s even though the United States has a much larger population and the number of cases has something to do with the number of tests being conducted and the United States has conducted more tests than any other country has:CNN which just days ago praised the need for per capita comparisons tweeted this last night:Italy is much smaller than the United States China is much bigger.Speaking of China and their reported cases there is also the issue of the quality of China’s reporting. China claims that it arrested the spread of the virus overnight a few weeks ago. It skyrocketed up to 80000 cases and then just stopped spreading in China and began spreading everywhere else in the world.Even with their draconian measures of welding people into their apartments forbidding travel electronic surveillance of the affected and other measures these numbers are impossible to believe. As Jeryl Bier points out the last paragraph of a New York Times article is reported credulously when it shouldn’t be: “China’s National Health Commission said earlier on Thursday that all 67 new coronavirus cases officially reported across the country on Wednesday were people who had been infected overseas as were all 47 reported the previous day.”As the reported cases in the United States surpassed the reported cases in China — not difficult to do given China’s very low quality of reporting and the fact that the United States is doing more testing than any other country — media were sure to trumpet the numbers:Yet many in the media don’t just believe them but enthusiastically relish the claim that the United States has more people infected with the coronavirus than China does. Joe “Science Means You Have To Always Do Per Capita Comparisons” Scarborough weighed in:Many media figures gave Chinese propagandists a run for their money. Here frequent CNN guest Julia Ioffe said of a country that is full of public health officials and doctors working valiantly to tackle a global epidemic that it is a “s—hole” country.Julia you might recall has had a rough couple of years including tweeting her speculative fantasies about Trump involving incest falling hard for debunked Russia collusion hoaxes and being pretty sure she’d figured out an elaborate Russian plot regarding Hunter Biden’s indiscretions.Ioffe’s fellow Russia collusion hoax promoter Benjamin Wittes was similarly excited by the increase in recorded cases of the deadly virus among his fellow Americans:Again sounding like Communist Chinese propagandists media outlet The Verge renamed the Wuhan Virus the American Virus on account of U.S. testing and results:Nobody in the media has explained why they accept the Communist Chinese government’s reported numbers despite their track record. As for whether to report numbers that are or are not controlled for population even that metric can be lacking.For instance while Washington state had the earlier significant outbreak of the novel Chinese Coronavirus New York is experiencing much worse spread. Further in the United States of America each state has the right to respond differently to the outbreak. It is more worthwhile to compare by city.Not everyone was bad on this point. The Washington Examiner’s Phil Klein put many of the global numbers in context for his article “US does not have close to the most coronavirus cases when adjusted for population.” Also credit to Jim Geraghty for his ongoing skepticism of Communist Chinese propaganda.To compare country statistics by population you can go to this page at Real Clear Politics.
455,The Scientist Whose Doomsday Pandemic Model Predicted Armageddon Just Walked Back The Apocalyptic Predictions,Madeline Osburn,The Federalist,2,https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/26/the-scientist-whose-doomsday-pandemic-model-predicted-armageddon-just-walked-back-the-apocalyptic-predictions/,British scientist Neil Ferguson ignited the world’s drastic response to the novel Wuhan coronavirus when he published the bombshell report predicting 2.2 million Americans and more than half a million Brits would be killed. After both the U.S. and U.K. governments effectively shut down their citizens and economies Ferguson is walking back his doomsday scenarios.Ferguson’s report from Imperial College which White House and other officials took seriously said that if the U.S. and U.K. did not shut down for 18 months and isolation measures were not taken “we would expect a peak in mortality (daily deaths) to occur after approximately 3 months.” His “models” showed overflowing hospitals and ICU beds.“For an uncontrolled epidemic we predict critical care bed capacity would be exceeded as early as the second week in April with an eventual peak in ICU or critical care bed demand that is over 30 times greater than the maximum supply in both countries” the report reads.Dr. Deborah Birx the White House coronavirus response coordinator reportedly said the administration was particularly focused on the Imperial College report’s conclusion that entire households should stay in isolation for 14 days if any member suffered from COVID-19 symptoms.But after tens of thousands of restaurants bars and businesses closed Ferguson is now retracting his modeling saying he feels “reasonably confident” our health care system can cope when the predicted peak of the epidemic arrives in a few weeks. Testifying before the U.K.’s parliamentary select committee on science and technology on Wednesday Ferguson said he now predicts U.K. deaths from the disease will not exceed 20000 and could be much lower.Alex Berenson✔@AlexBerenson· Mar 26 20201/ This is a remarkable turn from Neil Ferguson who led the @imperialcollege authors who warned of 500000 UK deaths - and who has now himself tested positive for #COVID; https://www.newscientist.com/article/2238578-uk-has-enough-intensive-care-units-for-coronavirus-expert-predicts/ …UK has enough intensive care units for coronavirus expert predicts | New ScientistNeil Ferguson whose modelling has informed the UK's coronavirus strategy says that the need for intensive care beds will come close to but not exceed national capacitynewscientist.comAlex Berenson✔@AlexBerenson2/ He now says both that the U.K. should have enough ICU beds and that the coronavirus will probably kill under 20000 people in the U.K. - more than 1/2 of whom would have died by the end of the year in any case bc they were so old and sick.32217:14 AM - Mar 26 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy1243 people are talking about thisJordan Schachtel✔@JordanSchachtelBig thread.

The New Scientist reports Ferguson did acknowledge it was impractical to keep the country in an isolated lockdown for 12 to 18 months especially because of the impact on the economy. “We’ll be paying for this year for decades to come” he said.The Imperial College report was also the basis for the modeling used by the website COVID Act Now which local and state officials in the U.S. then used to issue “shelter-in-place” mandates. COVID Act Now which was founded by a handful of Democratic activists in Silicon Valley is an online mapping tool that generates models predicting coronavirus hospitalizations which have also already proved to be wildly inaccurate.
456,Inaccurate Virus Models Are Panicking Officials Into Ill-Advised Lockdowns,Madeline Osburn,The Federalist,2,https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/25/inaccurate-virus-models-are-panicking-officials-into-ill-advised-lockdowns/,As U.S. state and local officials halt the economy and quarantine their communities over the Wuhan virus crisis one would hope our leaders were making such major decisions based on well-sourced data and statistical analysis. That is not the case.A scan of statements made by media state governors local leaders county judges and more show many relying on the same source an online mapping tool called COVID Act Now. The website says it is “built to enable political leaders to quickly make decisions in their Coronavirus response informed by best available data and modeling.”An interactive map provides users a catastrophic forecast for each state should they wait to implement COVID Act Now’s suggested strict measures to “flatten the curve.” But a closer look at how many of COVID Act Now’s predictions have already fallen short and how they became a ubiquitous resource across the country overnight suggests something more sinister.When Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins announced a shelter-in-place order on Dallas County Sunday he displayed COVID Act Now graphs with predictive outcomes after three months if certain drastic measures are taken. The NBC Dallas affiliate also embedded the COVID Act Now models in their story on the mandate.The headline of an NBC Oregon affiliate featured COVID Act Now data and a headline blaring “Coronavirus model sees Oregon hospitals overwhelmed by mid-April.” Both The Oregonian and The East Oregonian also published stories featuring the widely shared data predicting a “point of no return.”Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer cited COVID Act Now when telling her state they would exceed 7 million cases in Michigan with 1 million hospitalized and 460000 deaths if the state did nothing.A local CBS report in Georgia featured an Emory University professor urging Gov. Brian Kemp with the same “point of no return” language and COVID Act Now models.Carlos del Rio✔@CarlosdelRio7We need ⁦@GovKemp⁩ to act now the point of “no return” for GA is rapidly closing.

By March 19 they only had 15 patients hospitalized.In New York Covid Act Now claimed nearly 5400 New Yorkers would’ve been hospitalized by March 19. The actual number of hospitalizations is around 750. The site also claimed nearly 13000 New York hospitalizations by March 23. The actual number was around 2500.In Georgia COVID Act Now predicted 688 hospitalizations by March 23. By that date they had around 800 confirmed cases in the whole state and fewer than 300 hospitalized.In Florida Covid Act Now predicted that by March 19 the state would face 400 hospitalizations. On March 19 Gov. Ron DeSantis said 90 people in Florida had been hospitalized.COVID Act Now’s models in other states including Oklahoma and Virginia were also far off in their predictions. Jordan Schachtel a national security writer said COVID Act Now’s modeling comes from one team based at Imperial College London that is not only highly scrutinized but has a track record of bad predictions.Jordan Schachtel✔@JordanSchachtelReplying to @JordanSchachtel4) Their models come 100% from Imperial College UK projection that is coming under *heavy* scrutiny from scientific community. IC UK produced the famed doomsday scenario that guaranteed 2MM dead Americans. The man behind the projections is refusing to make his code public.5304:17 PM - Mar 24 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy295 people are talking about thisJessica Hamzelou at New Scientist notes the systematic errors researchers and scientists have found with the modeling COVID Act Now relies on:Chen Shen at the New England Complex Systems Institute a research group in Cambridge Massachusetts and his colleagues argue that the Imperial team’s model is flawed and contains ‘incorrect assumptions’. They point out that the Imperial team’s model doesn’t account for the availability of tests or the possibility of ‘super-spreader events’ at gatherings and has other issues.Among other issues COVID Act Now lists the “Known Limitations” of their model. Here are a few that seem especially alarming considering they generate a model for each individual state:Many of the inputs into this model (hospitalization rate hospitalization rate) are based on early estimates that are likely to be wrong.Demographics populations and hospital bed counts are outdated. Demographics for the USA as a whole are used rather than specific to each state.The model does not adjust for the population density culturally-determined interaction frequency and closeness humidity temperature etc in calculating R0.This is not a node-based analysis and thus assumes everyone spreads the disease at the same rate. In practice there are some folks who are ‘super-spreaders’ and others who are almost isolated.So why is the organization or seemingly innocent online mapping tool using inaccurate algorithms to scaremonger leaders into tanking the economy? Politics of course.Founders of the site include Democratic Rep. Jonathan Kreiss-Tomkins and three Silicon Valley tech workers and Democratic activists — Zachary Rosen Max Henderson and Igor Kofman — who are all also donors to various Democratic campaigns and political organizations since 2016. Henderson and Kofman donated to the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016 while Rosen donated to the Democratic National Committee recently resigned Democratic Rep. Katie Hill and other Democratic candidates. Prior to building the COVID Act Now website Kofman created an online game designed to raise $1 million for the eventual 2020 Democratic candidate and defeat President Trump. The game’s website is now defunct.Perhaps the goal of COVID Act Now was never to provide accurate information but to scare citizens and government officials into to implementing rash and draconian measures. The creators even admit as much with the caveat that “this model is designed to drive fast action not predict the future.”They generated this model under the guise of protecting communities from overrun hospitals a trend that is not on track to happen as they predicted. Not only is the data false and looking more incorrect with each passing day but the website is optimized for a disinformation campaign.A social media share button prompts users to share their models and alarming graphs on Facebook and Twitter with the auto-fill text “This is the point of no return for intervention to prevent X’s hospital system from being overloaded by Coronavirus.”The daunting phrase the “point of no return” is the same talking point being repeated by government officials justifying their shelter-in-place orders and filling local news headlines.Democrats are not going to waste such a rich political opportunity as a global pandemic. Americans already witnessed Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats attempt to take advantage of an economic recession with a pipe-dream relief bill this week. Projects like COVID Act Now are another attempt to play the same political games but with help from unknown behind-the-scenes Democratic activists instead.Our community leaders the mayors and the city councils deserve better than to be swindled by a handful Silicon Valley tech bros. Our governors and state officials deserve better data and analysis than a Democratic activists’ model that doesn’t adjust for important geographical factors like population density or temperature. Americans and their families deserve better than to be jobless hopeless and quarantined because of a single website’s inaccurate and hyperbolic hospitalization models.
457,As Trump’s Poll Numbers Rise Media Begin Censoring Press Conferences,Mollie Hemingway,The Federalist,2,https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/26/as-trumps-poll-numbers-rise-media-begin-censoring-press-conferences/,"When polls showed that President Donald Trump was receiving unusually high marks for his handling of the Coronavirus pandemic the first stage of grief the media went through was denial:The political media have been working extremely hard to craft a narrative that the spread of the coronavirus was essentially the fault of the man they had blamed for all other ills in recent years. How could the people not accept that narrative particularly considering that most everyone in the media was pushing it?Things got worse when additional polls showed Trump receiving high ratings at the same time that the media received poor ratings. A brand new Gallup study — “Coronavirus Response: Hospitals Rated Best News Media Worst” — was particularly bad news. When Americans were asked about nine different institutions and political leaders they gave majority approval to all but the media. President Trump has a 22-point net approval rating while the media’s net approval rating was negative 11 points. The RealClearPolitics approval average for Trump was its highest during his entire presidency.In response the media were angry and depressed and began blaming his press conferences. Their theory seemed to be that the more Americans saw Trump unfiltered they liked him and the more Americans saw the behavior of the media they didn’t like it. This flies in the face of what many in the media assumed for years. They pushed for daily White House press conferences so that they could have the opportunity to be on camera and pressure the Trump administration. Now that they had daily press briefings with the president no less they weren’t happy. It was a weird response for a group of people whose ostensible job is to simply report the news of the day.This New York Times reporter began disparaging the public health briefings featuring some of the country’s top medical professionals:Within a few days the groupthink had firmly spread. Suddenly addressing the American people day after day — the very thing the media had demanded for years — was a dangerous departure from norms:An example of what they called a lie was Trump’s discussion of a potential treatment for those infected with the coronavirus. The proposed treatment has not gone through extensive clinical trials for the Wuhan coronavirus in particular although it well established in use for malaria patients and many doctors are hoping to continue its use for the novel coronavirus. While New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is so bullish on the treatment that he authorized its use in his state he has not received any criticism from the media. The absurdity of claiming that Trump was lying about this promising treatment plan was topped by the media blaming Trump when one individual seeking to prevent infection ingested fish tank cleaner because it contained similar ingredients.Here an “All Things Considered” host at a public radio station funded by tax dollars had this considered response:After spending months demanding that the White House reinstate press conference they are now demanding he shut them down as his performance is going better than theirs.The Washington Post whose tagline is “Democracy Dies In Darkness” demanded that the lights on the presidential press briefings be turned off.Kyle Griffin✔@kylegriffin1Margaret Sullivan: ""The media must stop live-broadcasting Trump's dangerous destructive coronavirus briefings."" https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/the-media-must-stop-live-broadcasting-trumps-dangerous-destructive-coronavirus-briefings/2020/03/21/b8a2a440-6b7c-11ea-9923-57073adce27c_story.html?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter …Perspective | The media must stop live-broadcasting Trump’s dangerous destructive coronavirus...He’s just using them as a substitute for his rallies. Put him on tape-delay so journalists can counter his rush of misinformation.washingtonpost.com14.8K8:00 AM - Mar 22 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy4025 people are talking about thisWhile Americans might not appreciate the media censoring the public health briefings Sullivan had one fan in Communist China. Lijian Zhao the spokesperson & Deputy Director General of the Information Department in communist China’s Foreign Ministry retweeted MSNBC’s Kyle Griffin who had tweeted out in support of Sullivan’s censorship plan:Ted Koppel told the New York Times “Training a camera on a live event and just letting it play out is technology not journalism; journalism requires editing and context.” While it’s true that good journalists will provide context that’s precisely what’s been missing in their histrionic and sensationalized coverage of this global pandemic. They share aggregate numbers to inflame passions they highlight poor performing hospitals and blame the coronavirus even though the same hospitals were overwhelmed previously they peddle faulty models that incite horrific panic.What the media instead are realizing is that they have lost control over the filtering that they are used to providing. They seek to spin the news rather than simply show it and report it. And they justify their bias as being part of a higher calling in the journalism profession as opposed to a glaring failure.The media that was able to push impeachment while the coronavirus spread throughout the world that claimed concerns about it were racist and that attempts to control its spread were xenophobic now wants even more control over the message. Their plan to keep Americans in the dark about what the country’s top political and medical officials say unless it is filtered through a group of people who botched the 2016 campaign the Russia collusion narrative and the Kavanaugh confirmation hearing is a demonstration of something very dangerous.They don’t want to report the news. They want to control it. That is damaging and destructive to their own already hurting reputations but more importantly to public health itself."
458,Read Biden Accuser’s Account Of His Alleged Sexual Assault,Emily Jashinsky,The Federalist,2,https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/27/read-biden-accusers-account-of-his-alleged-sexual-assault/,Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden is battling a serious allegation of sexual assault one his accuser says she brought to the campaigns of Sens. Elizabeth Warren D-Mass. and Kamala Harris D-Calif. before they left the 2020 race. According to Tara Reade while she worked as a staff assistant for Biden in 1993 the senator “began kissing her without her permission pushed her against a wall reached under her skirt and penetrated her with his fingers” as Robby Soave wrote in Reason.According to journalist Katie Halper who recently interviewed Reade the woman’s brother and close friend “both recall Tara telling them about the incident at the time.” Compare that with Christine Blasey Ford’s reputation-destroying allegation against Justice Brett Kavanaugh which has been denied by all alleged witnesses.The Intercept reported that Reade attempted to bring her story to the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund earlier this year but the group declined to assist with the case citing its nonprofit status. Per The Intercept the public relations firm retained by Time’s Up is SKDKnickerboker; the group’s managing director Anita Dunn is the top advisor to Biden’s campaign.Reade sat for an extensive interview with The Hill’s Saagar Enjeti and Krystal Ball on Thursday morning where she responded to questions about why she stayed silent for nearly three decades and whether political motivations influenced her decision to speak out in 2020. In the interview Reade said that she contacted the Warren and Harris campaigns hoping to share her story but neither seriously followed up. Team Warren Reade said directed her to contact her local representative.The Federalist asked both senators’ offices on Thursday to confirm whether either was made aware of the allegations on the campaign trail but did not receive a response by press time.Because Reade’s story is compelling and drawing so little attention from the corporate media it’s worth digesting her words in full. To be clear this is a 30-year-old allegation with no corroborating witnesses so there’s no way for us to conclusively determine the veracity of Reade’s story. But now that she’s spoken out the ball is in voters’ court to consider whether she’s telling the truth and what that means for Biden’s qualifications as a presidential hopeful.As Soave noted Biden advocates frequently on behalf of sexual assault victims and has emphatically defended women who stay silent before ultimately coming forward with allegations. “For a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus nationally you’ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she’s talking about is real” Biden said during the Kavanaugh confirmation battle.The account of Biden’s alleged sexual assault as relayed by Reade to Halper is transcribed below. The news cycle is rightfully crowded with pandemic information right now as it absolutely should be. But the sad reality is that Biden who has a history of allegations of inappropriate touching would be battling heightened media pressure to respond to Reade if he weren’t a Democratic frontrunner. That doesn’t make her story any less worth our consideration.In her interview with Halper Reade began by remembering the alleged 1993 incident started when a boss called her into her office.[She] called me in and said ‘I want you to take this to Joe. He wants it. He wants you to bring it hurry.’ And I said ‘Okay’ and it was a gym bag. She said ‘take the gym bag.’ She called it athletic bag. And she said he was down towards the Capitol and he’ll meet you. So I went down and I was heading down towards there. And he was at first talking to someone I could see him at a different distance and then they went away. And then we were in like this side area. And he just said ‘Hey come here Tara.’ And then I handed him the thing and he greeted me he remembered my name.And then we were alone and it was the strangest thing. There was no exchange really. He just had me up against the wall. And I was wearing a skirt and you know business skirt but I wasn’t wearing stockings. It was kind of a hot day that day and I was wearing heels. And I remember my legs had been hurting from the marble you know of the Capitol like walking. So I remember that kind of stuff. I remember I was wearing a blouse and he just had me up against the wall. And the wall was cold. It happened all at once. The gym bag I don’t know where it went. I handed it to him was gone. And then his hands were on me and underneath my clothes.He went down my skirt but then up inside it and he penetrated me with his fingers. He was kissing me at the same time and he was saying something to me. He said several things and I can’t remember everything. I remember a couple of things. I remember him saying first before like as he was doing it ‘Do you want to go somewhere else?’ And then him saying to me when I pulled away he got finished doing what he was doing and I kind of was pulled back and he said he said ‘Come on man. I heard you liked me.’ And that phrase stayed with me because I kept thinking what I might have said and I can’t remember exactly if he said ‘I thought ‘or if ‘I heard’ but it’s like he implied like that I had done this like I don’t know.And for me it was like everything shattered in that moment because I knew we alone. It was over right? He wasn’t trying to do anything more. But I looked up to him. He was like my father’s age. He was this champion of women’s rights in my eyes and I couldn’t believe what was happening. It seemed surreal. I just felt sick because he when he pulled back he looked annoyed. And he said something else to me that I don’t want to say.* And then he said I must have looked shocked and he grabbed me by the shoulders. I don’t know how I looked but I must have looked something because he grabbed me by the shoulders and he said ‘You’re okay you’re fine. You’re okay you’re fine. ‘ And then he walked away and he went on with his day.And what I remember next is being in the Russell building like where the big windows are in the stairs by myself. My body I was shaking everywhere because it was cold all of a sudden I was I don’t know I felt like I was shaking just everywhere and I was trying to grasp what had just happened and what I should do or what I should say. But I knew it was bad because he was so angry. Like when he left I could feel you know how when you know someone’s angry they don’t necessarily say anything. Like he smiles when he’s angry. And you can just feel it emanating from him.*Pressed by Halper Reade claimed later in the interview that Biden allegedly pointed his finger at her and said “You’re nothing to me.”
459,‘Sanctuary’ Cities That Rejected Federal Law Are Now Pleading For Federal Help,Tristan Justice,The Federalist,2,https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/27/sanctuary-cities-that-rejected-federal-law-are-now-pleading-for-federal-help/,Localities that declared themselves “Sanctuary Cities” to reject federal law and coordination in order to harbor illegal immigrants are now begging for federal help in the face of the Wuhan virus pandemic.New York City which has become the epicenter of the Wuhan virus outbreak in the United States is seeing a surging case load overwhelm its hospitals. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned Thursday that the situation has become so dire the city’s morgues are reaching capacity. Hospitals are stretched thin with dwindling supplies as New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and the state’s governor Andrew Cuomo plead for resources from the feds all while skirting immigration laws as a sanctuary state and city.Last week Mayor de Blasio urged President Donald Trump to dispatch the military as the cases began to surge but simultaneously taking the crisis opportunity to criticize the president.“The fate of New York City rests in the hands of one. He is a New Yorker. And right now he is betraying the city he comes from” de Blasio said never mind that the mayor’s own lackluster response likely exacerbated the problem by encouraging New Yorkers to go to the movies and hesitating to close schools as the virus was blowing up.De Blasio demanded 15000 ventilators 3 million N95 masks 50 surgical masks and 25 million surgical gowns coveralls and pairs of gloves in addition to mobilizing the military.Gov. Cuomo made a similar request on Tuesday calling on federal help to supply the state 30000 ventilators from the national stockpile of medical supplies which only has little more than half that number in storage.So far the federal government has largely tried to adequately respond to the pleas for help with the available resources on hand as it reasonably should.Facing a shortage of equipment on hand himself Trump on Thursday questioned Cuomo’s need for the 30000 ventilators requested but has still pledged a fourth of the entire stockpile to be sent to the Empire State. On Tuesday Vice President Mike Pence announced that 4000 ventilators would be shipped to New York hospitals. Trump has also said the federal government is sending other supplies such as N95 respirators surgical masks face shields coveralls and gloves though the amount have come up short of the mayor and governor’s requests and some equipment has become expired while in reserve.New York is not alone in crying out for federal assistance. Cities and states across the country are beginning to see a spike in cases that threaten to bring their own health care institutions under siege and are depending on federal assistance to come though all while resisting the same government’s duty to enforce immigration law.On Tuesday the Pentagon also announced it would be deploying three Army field hospitals to both New York and Washington state both of which are declared sanctuary states that refuse state agencies from complying with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Other sanctuary states and cities including California have been granted presidential approval for “Major Disaster Declarations” that will open the door for new federal assistance to pour into states heavily impacted.The federal government has pulled seemingly every lever to come to the rescue. Trump invoked the Stafford Act and the Defense Production Act to free up additional emergency funds and push the private sector into producing necessary medical equipment needed to combat the outbreak.Congress meanwhile has passed several spending packages to confront the epidemic and the economic fallout to follow including a $2 trillion bipartisan stimulus bill that passed the Senate and is expected to pass the House on Friday with the president’s blessing.If states and cities are so eager to accept assistance from the federal government to combat the crisis as they should will they finally allow the feds to conduct federal immigration law?
460,Vulture Investors Using Coronavirus Carnage to Wipe Out Small Business,Helen Raleigh,The Federalist,2,https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/27/how-patriotic-american-businesses-are-stepping-up-to-beat-the-wuhan-virus/,As confirmed Wuhan coronavirus cases in the United States surpass 60000 our nation is in war mode. Winning a war requires all hands on deck. It appears American businesses and innovators are up to the challenge however as more and more private companies are contriving creative ways to play a part in beating this pandemic.In New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has been making apparent his state’s dire need for more ventilators. In the most severe cases of those infected with COVID-19 patients’ lungs become inflamed and fill with fluid making them unable to breathe effectively on their own. For these patients the medical ventilator makes the difference between life and death. The coronavirus pandemic however has induced a staggering global shortage in the ventilator-to-patient ratio.The U.S. government has 170000 ventilators stockpiled strategically but experts say this may not be enough if the number of cases continues to increase at its current rate. Cuomo explained his state needs 30000 ventilators and so far he has only 7000. Cuomo has been vocal in demanding the federal government prioritize his state’s needs but the federal government has more than one state to think about.A ventilator is a complex medical device that costs $50000 each on average. The Food and Drug Administration used to have strict oversight on which company is permitted to manufacture ventilators. Given the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak and increasing demand for the devices however the FDA relaxed its rules on the manufacture and use of ventilators on March 22. It also published a guideline the same day that offers “a streamlined path to market for automakers and other non-medtech manufacturers that want to repurpose their plants to supply ventilators.”Some lawmakers and health-care professionals wanted the federal government to push further. They urged President Donald Trump to use the Defense Production Act to require American companies currently in the non-medical devices sector to start producing ventilators immediately. Cuomo even wanted the president to nationalize the medical supply chain. Trump resisted such calls; numerous American companies had already leaped to action before the FDA changed its guidelines. Compelling American companies through stringent government orders would only hinder progress not further it.The Private Sector Is Stepping UpLast week medical device-maker Madtronic as well as automaker Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk both tweeted that the two corporations were discussing how to work together in the light of the pandemic. Furthermore General Motors and medical equipment company Ventec Life Systems also announced their joint partnership under the name “Project V” with the goal of speeding up the production of ventilators to “support our country’s fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.”GM adds great value by using its vast supply network to secure critical materials and even build certain parts for Ventec’s ventilators. Ventec CEO Chris Kiple elaborated on the cooperation in a statement: “[W]ith GM’s help Ventec will increase ventilator production. By tapping their expertise GM is enabling us to get more ventilators to more hospitals much faster. This partnership will help save lives.”After the FDA relaxed its guidance Sunday Trump tweeted “Ford General Motors and Tesla are being given the go ahead to make ventilators and other metal products FAST! Go for it auto execs lets see how good you are?”After the president’s tweet Ford announced it would work with GE Healthcare to “expand production of a simplified version of GE Healthcare’s existing ventilator” and “these ventilators could be produced at a Ford manufacturing site in addition to a GE location.” Moreover Ford said it was working with 3M to develop air-purifying respirators to meet the demand for first responders and health-care workers. Along with the cooperation of United Auto Workers Ford will also “assemble more than 100000 critically needed plastic face shields per week at a Ford manufacturing site to help medical professionals factory workers and store clerks.”Besides large auto companies other smaller manufacturing companies are taking action. Reuters reported this week that Twin City Die Castings Inc. which makes aluminum and magnesium parts for ventilator compressors converted its production line to meet the higher demand of ventilators. Such conversion usually takes three months but Twin City’s employees completed the conversion in just one week by working almost nonstop. Twin City also said it would “share its intellectual property with rivals” so more companies can speed up the production process.Creative Mask ProductionBesides ventilators masks and surgical gowns are also in short supply. Fiat Chrysler said it would convert one of its plants in China to make face masks hoping to ramp up production to 1 million face masks a month.Some U.S. fashion brands have retooled their production to meet these needs. Los Angeles Apparel has been producing thousands of face masks each week for about a month now and the company said it had donated more than 10000 masks to hospitals in California Nevada New Mexico New York and Washington.Former “Project Runway” winner and current host Christian Siriano is known for making fancy gowns for the rich and famous. Now he is changing his manufacturing process and seeking the FDA’s approval to make surgical masks.Boosting Coronavirus Testing EffortsThe United States is ramping up Wuhan coronavirus testing. Still in some areas testing is highly restricted and our understanding of how the virus infects different demographics is limited. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Mastercard’s Impact Fund and the British philanthropy Wellcome Trust jointly committed $125 million to develop a COVID-19 therapeutics accelerator hoping to “speed-up the response to the COVID-19 epidemic by identifying assessing developing and scaling-up treatments.”On another note the Gates Foundation launched a separate project early in March to develop at-home coronavirus test kits. This week Amazon Care a medical division for Amazon’s employees said it would deliver the test kits to residents in Washington’s King County who feel sick and would pick up the kits for analysis at the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN) a private-and-public joint research project.Drugstore chain CVS opened a drive-through testing site on its parking lot for first responders in Massachusetts. Walmart and Walgreens promised to open similar mobile testing sites soon in Chicago.Capitalism Saves the DayI also want to give a shout out to grocery stores such as Kroger King Soopers and Sprouts. Other than a few items such as toilet paper and hand sanitizer the management teams and employees have been keeping these grocery stores well-stocked.Last time I was at King Soopers a smiling employee was wiping down shopping carts. There were plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits and some were even on sale. As more and more places are under lockdown neighborhood grocery stores are usually one of the few “essential” places that remain open. A well-stocked grocery store not only ensures many do not have to worry about food shortages during quarantine but it also provides immense psychological benefits by calming nerves and reassuring residents everything will be OK.I can go on and on with stories such as these. Socialists like Sen. Bernie Sanders wants us to believe our country is a dog-eat-dog world where only a few prosper while the rest struggle that American billionaires shouldn’t exist and that American corporations are all uniformly greedy and corrupt. Sanders wants the American people to give more power to the government because he believes it is the only way they will be taken care of.Yet as Wall Street Journal columnist Kim Strassel points out in this fight against the pandemic “the single biggest mistake so far came from the government. The feds maintained exclusive control over early test development — and blew it. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s failure delayed an effective U.S. response and the private sector is now riding to the rescue.”Strassel is right: The coronavirus pandemic vindicates capitalism. If we want to win this war against the pandemic we need to count more on American entrepreneurs and businesses for their ingenuity creativity and patriotism.
461,It’s Time For Us All To Get A Little More Humility And Wonder About Coronavirus,Margot Cleveland,The Federalist,2,https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/27/its-time-for-us-all-to-get-a-little-more-humility-and-wonder-about-coronavirus/,Two weeks into the coronavirus pandemic much remains unknown. There are two certainties though: Americans need more humility and we need more awe.Americans need humility to recognize the limits in our predictive capabilities; the uncertainty of scientific models; and that the countervailing interests of safeguarding lives and livelihoods render it impossible for any political leader to achieve a perfect outcome.The reflexive rejection of contrary views as either an ignorant exaggeration (or downplaying) of the danger of the coronavirus must soften. And the arrogant attitude that we or they own the answer and that anyone suggesting alternative responses to the coronavirus must be acting from stupidity malice or greed must stop.Learning a Lot FastWe need the humility to recognize that we just don’t know—a lot. What we know now we didn’t know three months ago. COVID-19 is a new disease. Initially experts believed most people infected with the coronavirus had contracted the disease by exposure to animals. In mid-January there was only “some indication” that “a limited person-to-person spreading of the disease” was happening.By January 21 2020 the first known cases in the United States involved travelers from Wuhan China. At that time experts at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) still believed “the current risk from this virus to the general public is low” and “for a family sitting around the dinner table tonight this is not something that they generally need to worry about.”Yet at the time the CDC stressed that it was preparing “as if the coronavirus was the next pandemic.” The CDC initiated airport screening and by January 21 2020 CDC scientists had also developed a diagnostic test for use at CDC headquarters while they continued to prepare a diagnostic test that could be used by state public health agencies through the flu-tracking system.By the end of January within two weeks of receiving the genetic sequencing of the coronavirus from China the CDC had created the test for the public health system and obtained the necessary Food and Drug Administration approval. By then President Trump had also banned travel from China even though at the time the scientific models recommended against that step.Some Things We Got Wrong Some RightBy February 3 2020 the worldwide threat of the coronavirus became clear. President Trump instituted more travel bans—Italy and then select European countries and later the United Kingdom Mexico and Canada. Those measures saved lives and slowed the spread within our borders even though the prudence of those decisions only became known retrospectively.Conversely retrospect revealed that the flu-tracking system was ineffective for screening for the coronavirus. Experts had wrongly concluded that the virus remained outside our borders and believed that quarantines—which had not been used for some 50 years—and “very aggressive” tracking of close contacts would isolate and limit the spread in the United States.But the virus had already been present in the United States for too long leading to a quick spread of the disease and worries that the pandemic would kills millions in our country. The government responded by closing down businesses schools government services and churches—in effect closing down America.The blame-throwing began. The government did too little too late and people will suffer and die as a result. No the government did too much—it overreacted it destroyed American businesses and livelihoods over a disease that is less severe than the flu.Seriously We Just Don’t Know YetJust as the experts did not know the reach of the coronavirus in January they did not know the risk of the respiratory disease in March. How deadly is it? How easily is it spread? How is it spread? How many lives are at risk? Who is at risk?Americans accustomed to instant gratification have lost their sense of awe. Science is not infallible. And testing treatments and cures are not immediate.The world is facing a new disease that was never before known to exist in human beings. Yet in the span of three months our country went from a gene sequence to limited diagnostic testing through the CDC system to high through-put testing and the creation of an entirely new testing system to instant tests and self-swabbing kits. Simple pin-prick blood tests that will detect coronavirus antibodies will be ready soon.Our country has also unleashed the power of capitalism to identify several promising therapeutic options and human studies are already underway. A vaccine has also already been developed with human studies already initiated—months earlier than expected and faster than any prior vaccine trial. Hospital patients are also already receiving plasma from survivors of the coronavirus with doctors hopeful that the antibodies from those who have recovered from the disease will successfully treat those in critical condition.Humility Is In Order TooOver the last month health experts have also been able to accumulate untold amounts of data. That data will provide more certainty about the disease and analyses will allow for our leaders to make more educated decisions concerning the reopening of America.We need more compassion for those people—real living human beings with families homes hopes and dreams.It may well be that that data will suggest early decisions were an overreaction and that businesses and livelihoods were unnecessarily destroyed. But models constructed from newly acquired data might be wrong just as the models recommending travel from China continue unabated proved wrong.As we wait for more details on the coronavirus we would be well served to abandon our hubris and accept that our country has never faced a similar crisis and that we will never know for sure whether without the aggressive response taken by our federal and state governments every locale would now be facing the same dire situation New York City finds itself confronting.Likewise those Americans who believe our country averted the worst disaster our republic ever faced need some humility: We need to recognize that reasonable people can also justifiably believe the government’s blunt response unnecessarily crippled our economy destroying lives and livelihoods in the process.We need more compassion for those people—real living human beings with families homes hopes and dreams. Moms and dads who labored for years decades generations to build something by sweat and toil only for it to be destroyed within a month. Small businesses with no choice but to lay off employees hoping to stave off a permanent shuttering of operations. As those lights extinguished employees were left without jobs and paychecks and with an unknown future.That suffering is real too. Any ignorant politicians who pretend the reopening of America is about Wall Street should be ashamed of their partisan grandstanding. They should be forced to repeat that nonsense while looking into the red weep-weary eyes of the average Americans who built this great country.
462,Media Rushes To Report On White Supremacists Using Coronavirus For Bioterror While Ignoring Same From Muslim Extremists,Kyle Shideler,The Federalist,2,https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/27/media-rushes-to-report-on-white-supremacists-using-coronavirus-for-bioterror-while-ignoring-same-from-muslim-extremists/,Breathless reporting that neo-Nazis and white supremacists intend to use coronavirus as a weapon is spreading through the corporate media faster than the virus itself. Yet the media practiced its own “social distancing” from a similar story a few weeks earlier about a New York-based Muslim Brotherhood member who videotaped himself urging people to infect police and military members with the virus.According to the report from ABC News members of law enforcement in New York City received an alert from the FBI regarding reports that: “‘Members of extremist groups are encouraging one another to spread the virus if contracted through bodily fluids and personal interactions.’ The FBI alert which went out on Thursday told local police agencies that extremists want their followers to try to use spray bottles to spread bodily fluids to cops on the street. The extremists are also directing followers to spread the disease to Jews by going ‘any place they may be congregated to include markets political offices businesses and places of worship.’”While nothing quoted in the ABC News report specifically mentions white supremacists as the focus of the FBI alert despite the headline other reporting does seem to confirm the story. Yahoo News cited a Federal Protective Service memo that noted “White Racially Motivated Violent Extremists have recently commented on the coronavirus stating that it is an ‘OBLIGATION’ to spread it should any of them contract the virus.” Racially Motivated Violent Extremists is an ambiguous term adopted by the FBI to refer to all forms of racist extremism after blowback from members of Congress forced the law enforcement agency to abandon the term “Black Identity Extremists.”On March 16 nearly a week prior to the ABC News story the Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) reported on a New York-based Muslim Brotherhood member Bahgat Saber who urged any Egyptian with coronavirus to deliberately spread the disease to Egyptian military police and political figures. Saber also stated he would personally spread it to the Egyptian Consulate in New York if he were to be infected.In contrast to the ABC news report about white supremacists which relies on leaked quotes from a single law enforcement alert MEMRI provides video evidence of Saber making his remarks. Yet they were not covered in the mainstream media while only a handful of few conservative and Jewish outlets mentioned the story. The website Algemeiner very responsibly covered both stories however noting “Neo-Nazi and Islamist extremists have found another common cause” in spreading the virus.The potential of bioterrorism is a genuine concern and needs to be taken seriously regardless of the source. In practice however the federal government does not have a sterling record of success with bioterror investigations.In 1998 the FBI arrested Larry Wayne Harris a reported member of the Aryan Nation White supremacist group for an alleged plot to spread anthrax in New York City based on boasts he’d allegedly made that were reported to the Bureau. But the case collapsed at trial when what the FBI believed to be anthrax turned out to be anthrax vaccine.An Anti-Defamation League report on extremism and bioterrorism notes that Harris was actually obsessed with the notion of preventing not causing a bioterror attack and suffered from fantastical delusions. At the time Sen. Chuck Grassley called the case an example of the FBI “crying wolf.”The bureau was similarly embarrassed in 2001 after it tried and failed to pin the 2001 anthrax attacks on scientist Steven Hatfill who eventually won a $5.8 million settlement from the government for their behavior which included leaks to the media. The federal government later claimed the attacks were carried out by scientist Bruce Ivins although the allegations were never proven in court after Ivins committed suicide before he could be charged.Subsequent media investigations raised doubts about Ivins’s culpability as well. The FBI’s mishandling of the 2001 anthrax case became an element of reporting during the Robert Mueller special counsel investigation when Bureau critics pointed out that both Mueller and James Comey had played a role in the botched case. In both cases the stories were breathlessly reported by a willing media that took FBI leaks at face value.It is important that significant terror threats including bioterrorism be thoroughly investigated. However one should be wary of leaked reports which do not provide the total perspective of the likelihood of the threat.Extremists of all stripes routinely discuss potential plots that they have neither the capability nor the willingness to carry out. While the media and some politicians will continue to make white supremacists the singular domestic terror focus law enforcement should take a more measured approach.
463,As Coronavirus Hits Hospitals The Ugly Specter Of Euthanasia Raises Its Head,Ashley Bateman,The Federalist,2,https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/27/as-coronavirus-hits-hospitals-the-ugly-specter-of-euthanasia-raises-its-head/,Increased physician-assisted suicide (PAS) in the United States is stripping the vulnerable of their equal rights in the American health care system even as the country pledges to protect its most at-risk citizens at any cost during the coronavirus pandemic.Health-care rationing already exists especially for the sick and elderly and worries about tight hospital supplies have sparked discussions about keeping medical care from elderly coronavirus patients even though U.S. hospitals are not yet as overwhelmed as other nations’ hospitals are. MSN News recently reported that U.S. hospitals are discussing “do not resuscitate” orders for coronavirus patients “regardless of the wishes of the patient or their family members.”The justification is that anywhere from eight to 30 hospital staff are required to attempt to resuscitate such a patient and the process for doing so would put medical personnel in danger of contracting the virus and use up crucial medical products that are in short supply.If the United States gets to the desperate point other nations such as Italy have lacking the medical equipment and personnel to treat all critical coronavirus patients triage will be necessary. Yet it is crucial that triage decisions such as these do not discriminate based solely on age or disability writes ethics professor Charles Camosy:New York state put together a protocol back in 2008 titled ‘Allocation of Ventilators in a Public Health Disaster’ (largely reaffirmed in 2015) designed for a moment like ours. Wisely our state insists that age and health problems or disabilities unrelated to what is causing the epidemic shouldn’t serve as the basis for rationing. Prognosis for recovery is what matters.A New York hospital could choose to give its last ventilator to the 72-year-old marathon runner rather than to the 57-year-old pack-a-day smoker. Again based only on prognosis for recovery. The objectivity of the standard removes much of the physician’s subjective ideology from the picture.Yet the cultural and medical climate in the United States has been growing more and more prejudiced against this kind of ethical calculus putting especially elderly and disabled Americans in greater danger.Disabled Elderly at Greatest Risk of Medical PrejudiceOn March 18 the National Council on Disability published a letter to Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights calling for increased attention and legal protection for the disabled as COVID-19 spreads. Citing current projections NCD Chairman Neil Romano wrote rationed care for COVID-19 patients creates an especially dangerous climate for the disabled.“The lack of resources to treat the population who will contract COVID-19 creates a deadly outlook for people with disabilities” Romano wrote. “…people with chronic illnesses and other disabilities have been left behind denied resources to survive and as a result have suffered great losses of life because of lack of emergency preparation that respects every life…Such prejudice has fed into the belief that people with disabilities especially the most weak and vulnerable should be put out of their misery.”Romano recommended the Office for Civil Rights issue a notice to health-care workers to enforce compliance with several federal laws that ban discrimination against disabled and elderly people. NCD’s concerns for the disabled population are raised to an “unprecedented level” under the pandemic’s shadow Romano wrote.Legalized Assisted Suicide Greases the Death SlopeSo far eight states California Colorado Hawaii Maine New Jersey Oregon Vermont Washington and the District of Columbia have legalized physician-assisted suicide (PAS). Physician-assisted deaths were ruled legal by the Montana Supreme Court in 2009 although there is no state statute.These legalizations use the same rationale as rationing or denying care to people based on their age and pre-existing conditions rather than their prognosis for recovery. Most laws require a patient to be a resident of a PAS-legal state have a prognosis of less than six months to live and voluntarily request and self-administer life-ending drugs.“If there’s any silver lining that we’re seeing come out of the COVID-19 pandemic it’s the renewed focus on caring for the vulnerable among us particularly older Americans and those with underlying health conditions” says U.S. Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio) who introduced a bipartisan resolution that expresses congressional disapproval of PAS. “In the era of physician-assisted suicide and what Pope Francis has deemed the ‘throwaway culture’ I’m encouraged to see all of the outreach and support given to these at-risk populations. I hope that it continues on even when we move past this coronavirus.”Proponents call it “death with dignity” to reduce the stigma of the words “suicide” and “euthanasia.” These concepts have degraded medical ethics in other life-and-death situations such as the scenario of triaging limited care for very ill coronavirus patients.Medical interventions and extreme pain can induce behavior and circumstances considered “undignified” and fear of death easily leads to a fear of lack of dignity said John Seeds an MD and former professor at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine.“There can be no dignity for one human person to take the life of another” Seeds said. “No one can accurately predict the circumstances of their death. Pain can be controlled. Fear is more difficult.”Clouding Medical Professionals’ JudgmentEuthanasia directly conflicts with the ethical and moral obligation of a physician Seeds noted. The Hippocratic Oath the physicians’ code of ethics includes the promise to not purposely take the life of a patient.“I do see our culture moving toward the removal of legal and moral restrictions on these procedures” Seeds said. “The evolving divorce between the practice of medicine and the ethical and moral foundations of civilization is a modern tragedy.”The concepts of “quality of life” “dignity” and others that automatically assume age and disability discounts a life compared to others are affecting medicine in myriad ways outside triage decisions and euthanasia said Marilyn M. Singleton MD.“As Medicare faces bankruptcy and insurance companies seek more profits what better way whether consciously or unconsciously to remove costly patients from the insurance rolls in the name of compassion?” Singleton said. “Already patients are being steered into hospice sometimes before other more expensive treatment options have been offered.”In his letter Romano requested immediate regulatory action to protect at-risk patients as COVID-19 spreads nationwide recommending a notice to medical providers underlining their legal obligations to provide care without discrimination.“Historic and deep-seated biases and stereotypes about people with disabilities…have resulted in eugenics and lack of life-saving care” Romano wrote. “The civil rights of people with disabilities cannot be suspended or limited.”
464,No a COVID Scientist Didn’t Walk Back His Prediction,Robert Verbruggen,The National Review,2,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/coronavirus-pandemic-neil-ferguson-did-not-walk-back-covid-19-predictions/,A narrative rocketed around social media earlier today: An Imperial College study said that COVID-19 could kill 500000 Brits but in recent testimony Neil Ferguson the head of the group behind the study put the number below 20000. Clearly the lying alarmist was walking back his ridiculous predictions!Well no. The paper actually offered simulations of numerous scenarios. The one resulting in 500000 deaths was one where Great Britain just carried on life as before. Other scenarios where the country locked down whenever it was necessary to stop the disease’s spread put death totals below 20000. (See the rightmost death columns of Tables 4 and 5.)Since the paper came out Great Britain has adopted a strategy of aggressively containing the virus and expanded its intensive-care capacity so a prediction of a much lower death toll and less stress on ICUs hardly seems surprising.Models like this will always turn out to be wrong in some way or other because they rely on very strong assumptions about aspects of the disease we haven’t thoroughly studied yet. If nothing else the original Imperial model will be obsolete soon because it didn’t predict what could happen with extensive testing and contact tracing which is likely the next step once the spread is contained and we have enough tests to go around. But it hasn’t been walked back just yet.Update: Ferguson himself explains all this in a Twitter thread:neil_ferguson@neil_ferguson1/4 - I think it would be helpful if I cleared up some confusion that has emerged in recent days. Some have interpreted my evidence to a UK parliamentary committee as indicating we have substantially revised our assessments of the potential mortality impact of COVID-19.92575:52 PM - Mar 26 2020Twitter Ads info and privacy5054 people are talking about this36Update 2: A variation on this argument people keep throwing at me is that if the death toll hasn’t been walked back the original study’s claim that we need to quarantine until a vaccine is developed a year or more from now has been. This doesn’t really work either.The model says that you can’t lock things down for a while and then just lift the lockdown because the virus will come back. You need some kind of continuing containment efforts. The original study modeled an idea where lockdowns are lifted and go back into effect repeatedly — that’s where the sub-20000 death estimates come from — and the text of the report explicitly noted the possibility that strategies could change over time to include test and trace. (As I say above though not actually modeling this type of effort is a big limit of the study because that’s where things seem headed.) In his testimony Ferguson did not advocate a brief lockdown that was later simply lifted; he said the lockdown would be effective until new methods could come online. Which is completely consistent with the original report.
465,The Timeline of How Bill de Blasio Prepared New York City for the Coronavirus,Jim Geraghty,The National Review,2,https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/the-timeline-of-how-bill-de-blasio-prepared-new-york-city-for-the-coronavirus/?itm_campaign=headline-testing-the-timeline-of-how-bill-de-blasio-prepared-new-york-city-for-the-coronavirus&itm_medium=headline&itm_source=nationalreview&itm_content=The%20Timeline%20of%20How%20Bill%20de%20Blasio%20Prepared%20New%20York%20City%20for%20the%20Coronavirus&itm_term=The%20Timeline%20of%20How%20Bill%20de%20Blasio%20Prepared%20New%20York%20City%20for%20the%20Coronavirus,By January 26 the world had 2014 reported cases of the coronavirus with the vast majority in China but 29 in ten other countries including two in the United States. An unknowable but significant number of asymptomatic carriers were traveling around the world unwittingly spreading it further. The opportunity to contain the virus in Wuhan or within China had long since passed hindered by the Chinese government’s false public statements that human-to-human transmission wasn’t occurring.Two days earlier New York City officials laid out their preparedness plans accurately assessing that the city’s international travel hub and large population made the coronavirus’s arrival just about inevitable. Mayor Bill de Blasio declared “We have to act on the assumption that there will unfortunately be cases sooner rather than later in New York City. . . . We are working from the assumption that it’s a profound challenge. There’s no one here who is minimizing it.”But de Blasio also said “What we do know to date is that only through prolonged exposure can someone contract this virus. It is not a situation as with some other diseases where a single contact would be enough.”This was the first of many times that city officials unknowingly shared information about the coronavirus that was not accurate and they encouraged city residents to continue activities that probably continued the spread of the virus. With New York City now the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States the decisions and statements by city officials from late January to early March have an unnerving sense of whistling past the graveyard with well-meaning but bad advice exacerbating the coming deluge.“The de Blasio administration is prepared for the likelihood of the novel coronavirus in New York City” Dr. Raul Perea-Henze the city’s deputy mayor for health and human services said on January 24. “We urge all New Yorkers to continue to pursue their everyday activities and routines but to remain aware of the facts about coronavirus. Those with a travel history should see a doctor at the first sign of any flu-like symptoms.”WATCH: 0:40NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio Raises Alarm Over 'An Explosion' Of New Coronavirus CasesThe coronavirus had been circulating in Wuhan since at least early December. The last direct flight from Wuhan China to John F. Kennedy Airport had landed January 23.On January 26 New York City’s health commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot warned “It’s inevitable that we will have someone who is positive with coronavirus.” She also said “We are encouraging New Yorkers to go about their everyday lives and suggest practicing everyday precautions that we do through the flu season.” She added that those “who had recently traveled from Wuhan were not being urged to self-quarantine or avoid large public gatherings.”New York City officials were not alone in their assessment. Most U.S. government figures underestimated the enormity of the threat that coronavirus presented. On January 22 President Trump had made his first public comment about the coronavirus during an interview on CNBC making it sound like no threat at all:Joe Kernen: Are there worries about a pandemic at this point?President Trump: No. Not at all. And — we’re — we have it totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.That day the Chinese government announced sweeping quarantine measures for Wuhan that effectively shut the city down. Some American lawmakers might have concluded that the fact that an authoritarian regime not known for its concern for human life or public health had taken such drastic measures with such severe economic repercussions was an indicator that the virus had to be a severe threat. But two days later the president publicly expressed confidence in China’s handling of the virus declaring in a tweet “China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular on behalf of the American People I want to thank President Xi!”But elsewhere in the country other Americans were already grasping the scale of the threat. In late January five radiologists and doctors at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City began their work as part of an international team making the first study of computed tomography scans — more commonly known as CT scans — of lungs of coronavirus patients in China.The study published on February 4 concluded that the CT scans for COVID-19 had many similar features to SARS and MERS and that “experience from those epidemics may be helpful in managing the current outbreak.”But for weeks city officials discouraged New Yorkers from altering their routines or behaviors before the contagiousness of the coronavirus and severity of the outbreak became painfully clear. Public officials’ insistence that life could and should go on as normal for most city residents continued all the way into mid-March — probably exacerbating an already-threatening situation.January 28A noteworthy point in Mayor de Blasio’s comments on this day was his recognition that the world’s understanding about the coronavirus was probably hindered by the Chinese government: “What we now know is this virus was underestimated by the Chinese government. It was actually beginning to spread and was not recognized sufficiently and talked about openly. And you know that has a lot to do with the situation in China and the way things are governed. . . . So really emphasizing to New Yorkers it’s probably here already. That’s the sad reality. It’s probably here in the form of individuals who in the you know existing in individuals who have been to Wuhan or have family members who’ve been to Wuhan and have had some prolonged exposure and the symptoms.”February 1New York City had its first suspected case of coronavirus at Bellevue Hospital Center in a patient who had traveled to China. However this patient would later test negative.Flushing Queens canceled its annual Lunar New Year Chinese Temple Bazaar scheduled for that day. Organizers declared “Though there have not been any reported incidents of the coronavirus in our area Flushing Town Hall is aware of the concerns that many people in the community have about large gatherings at this time especially because the full risks of the virus are not yet known.”February 2Health officials identified two more potential cases one at Flushing Hospital Medical Center and one at New York–Presbyterian Queens. At this point all the suspected cases in the city involved patients who had recently traveled to China. However these and the next four suspected cases in the city subsequently tested negative.Mayor de Blasio said in a press availability that day “People should be very clear about what this disease is and what it isn’t and New Yorkers I always say are not intimidated easily. New Yorkers should go about our lives continue doing what we do. . . . We understand some things about this disease. As I said others are still unclear. But what is clear is the only way you get it is with substantial contact with someone who already has it. You don’t get it from a surface. You don’t get it from glancing or very temporary contact based on what we know now.”Health Commissioner Barbot tweeted “As we gear up to celebrate the Lunar New Year in NYC I want to assure New Yorkers that there is no reason for anyone to change their holiday plans avoid the subway or certain parts of the city because of coronavirus.”Also on this day the federal government took more steps to restrict those who were entering the country from the area around Wuhan China: “[The new policy] bars foreign nationals who have been in mainland China in the past 14 days from entering the United States. American citizens who have been to Hubei province — Wuhan is the capital city of Hubei — will be taken into mandatory quarantine upon entry into the United States or directly to a hospital if they are found to be ‘symptomatic’” said Rick Cotton the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey which operates Kennedy International La Guardia and Newark Liberty International airports.February 4China’s consul general in New York Huang Ping thanked the Chinese-American community and other concerned Americans on Tuesday for their aid in battling the coronavirus outbreak and criticized what he described as “an overreaction by the American government in severely restricting travel to and from China.”During a radio interview Mayor de Blasio declared “It’s two full weeks between when you might contract it and when it might show symptoms or any time within. . . . The people who would have the reason to think they have it — have those flu-like symptoms and have either been to China particularly to the Wuhan area or have been in close contact with people who have come back from there. So it’s a pretty limited number of folks. But if anyone fits that description they need to get to health care right away.” In the interview de Blasio noted that New York City has the largest Chinese population outside of Asia.February 5Health Commissioner Barbot declared on Twitter “Today our city is celebrating the Lunar New Year parade in Chinatown a beautiful cultural tradition with a rich history in our city. I want to remind everyone to enjoy the parade and not change any plans due to misinformation spreading about coronavirus.”February 6Barbot appeared on the television program Inside City Hall and attempted to explain how likely an infected person is to transmit the virus: “The important thing for New Yorkers to know is that in the city currently their risk is low and our city preparedness is high. So we know that this virus can be transmitted from one individual to another but that it is typically people who live together. There is no risk at this point in time — we are always learning more — about having it being transmitted in casual contact. We’re telling New Yorkers go about your lives take the subway go out enjoy life but practice everyday precautions. . . . If it were likely that it could be transmitted casually we would be seeing a lot more cases.”February 7The city government attempted to purchase nearly 200000 N95 masks but regular vendors had already run out. Comptroller Scott Stringer granted approval for early March orders of masks and hand sanitizer.February 9Chinatown in New York City held its annual Lunar New Year parade. As AM New York described the scene “Surgical masks were nearly absent from this parade as organizers elected officials costumed characters and visitors alike showed none of the fear caused by news of the virus’s spread in China. Mayor Bill de Blasio and other officials jammed a stage on Hester Street on Mott Street — the heart of Chinatown.”“We know in China so many of our loved ones are facing the challenges of the coronavirus but we stand together” de Blasio said. Senator Chuck Schumer was also in attendance and he declared “We love the fact that so many people come from all around the globe and make our city and our country a better place.”Councilman Mark D. Levine stated on Twitter “In powerful show of defiance of coronavirus scare huge crowds gathering in NYC’s Chinatown for ceremony ahead of annual Lunar New Year parade. Chants of ‘Be Strong Wuhan!’ If you are staying away you are missing out.” At this point it is impossible to know if any of the thousands of people in the crowd were infected with the coronavirus. If any were standing shoulder-to-shoulder in a large crowd is precisely what public health officials would later seek to discourage and prevent.February 13Mayor de Blasio conducted a taped interview with NBC News that ran during MSNBC’s Morning Joe. He said “We have an extraordinary public health apparatus here in New York City . . . and what became clear to me was it was really about telling the people of our city this is something we can handle but you got to follow some basic rules. . . . This should not stop you from going about your life. It should not stop you from going to Chinatown and going out to eat. I am going to do that today myself.”Later that day New York City Council speaker Corey Johnson said “It is important to support the Chinese community in New York City. Unfortunately many businesses and restaurants in Chinatown Flushing and Sunset Park are suffering because some customers are afraid of the coronavirus. But those fears are not based on facts and science. The risk of infection to New Yorkers is low. There is no need to avoid public spaces. I urge everyone to dine and shop as usual.”In the next several days Mayor de Blasio made fewer public appearances and statements as he experienced a bout of laryngitis.By now some doctors were already warning that casual contact could spread the virus. “The principal mode of transmission is still thought to be respiratory droplets which may travel up to six feet from someone who is sneezing or coughing. . . . Close contact with an infectious person such as shaking hands or touching a doorknob tabletop or other surfaces touched by an infectious person and then touching your nose eyes or mouth can also transmit the virus.”February 25The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a new warning to the public noting “person-to-person spread of COVID-19 appears to occur mainly by respiratory transmission. How easily the virus is transmitted between persons is currently unclear.” In a press briefing Nancy Messonnier director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases said that “cities and towns should plan for ‘social distancing measures’ like dividing school classes into smaller groups of students or closing schools altogether. Meetings and conferences may have to be canceled she said. Businesses should arrange for employees to work from home.”But it is also worth noting that in his briefing Dr. Anthony Fauci the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases sounded concerned but not alarmed: “You need to do nothing different than you’re already doing” but if an outbreak occurred “these are the kinds of things you want to think of.”February 26Mayor de Blasio had not said much about the coronavirus for the past two weeks but he held an update on the city’s preparation after the CDC warning. “No one should take the coronavirus situation lightly. In fact I think the problem we’re seeing in many countries of the world is that there was not an aggressive approach and there was not transparency and there was not a willingness to fully acknowledge the danger. Here in New York City we took the exact opposite approach.”The mayor expressed confidence in the city’s ability to handle an influx of cases. “Right now we have 1200 hospital beds that we can make available immediately for any individual who is in the testing process or who tests positive and needs isolation in a hospital setting 1200 beds that can be brought online immediately. That is a very very substantial capacity given what we’re seeing playing out even in some of the countries that are dealing with this crisis in a much deeper manner.” But he also added “We have requests out for an additional minimum of 300000 surgical masks to guarantee that these arrive in New York City promptly. We will need federal assistance so I’m calling on the federal government to help us and all other localities to get the masks we need.” He also said the CDC testing was moving too slowly and that city hospitals should be able to process the tests at local labs. “I think the CDC is trying very hard to address this crisis. I give them credit for that. I think the phrase I used earlier don’t let perfect be the enemy of good.”Deanne Criswell commissioner of the city’s Office of Emergency Management and a former FEMA official elaborated “We did put in the request for masks but everybody’s putting in requests. So there’s just a long waiting list and the only way to fulfill that is by the federal government. They have means where they can enact the Defense Production Act and get people to produce these more quickly.”February 27De Blasio appeared on MSNBC’s Morning Joe.” Only a brief portion of his interview dealt with the coronavirus preparations but the mayor said “We have literally 1200 hospital beds that we can turn on if we need to if it turns into something bigger and we have every element — public health and every other element of government — out there trying to make sure that people know to get to care and they’re making it easy for them to get to care. If we do that all over the country I think this country is going to be good.” He then went to do a press event with ’80s rock star Billy Idol to discourage New York City drivers from idling.February 28Health officials confirmed two new cases of coronavirus in California and Oregon believed to have been transmitted to people who had not traveled to other affected countries or come in close contact with anyone who had it. This suggested that asymptomatic individuals were now transferring the virus through “community spread.” A German team of doctors treating patients in Wuhan China wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine on February 18 that “we discovered that shedding of potentially infectious virus may occur in persons who have no fever and no signs or only minor signs of infection.”February 29The Food and Drug Administration declared that other labs besides their own could develop their own coronavirus tests. Mayor de Blasio and Health Commissioner Barbot issued statements welcoming the move.March 1Health officials announced the first confirmed case in New York a woman who contracted the virus while in Iran.The federal government’s perspective at that time was that asymptomatic carriers spreading the virus were possible but represented a lower-order threat. U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said in an interview with ABC News “With asymptomatic spreading which we’ve seen some evidence of but not the major driver. Dr. Fauci has said with respiratory illnesses you’ll see sometimes asymptomatic spreading but that is very — very odd if that were to be the driver of large-scale infection.”March 2Governor Andrew Cuomo Mayor de Blasio and city health officials held a press briefing about the city’s first confirmed case. Governor Cuomo declared “In this situation the facts defeat fear because the reality is reassuring. It is deep-breath time.”Discussing the fatality rate he said “1.4 percent that’s extrapolating from China and other countries. 80 percent it’ll resolve on their own. The woman who has now tested positive she’s at home she’s not even in a hospital so the perspective here is important. And the facts once you know the facts once you know the reality it is reassuring and we should relax because that’s what’s dictated by the reality of the situation. I get the emotion I understand; I understand the anxiety. I’m a native-born New Yorker we live with anxiety. But the facts don’t back it up here. . . . What happened in other countries versus what happened here we don’t even think it’s going to be as bad as it was in other countries.”De Blasio concurred. “We have a lot of information now information that is actually showing us things that should give us more reason to stay calm and go about our lives. . . . This is not so far something that you get through casual contact. There has to be some prolonged exposure. And I think it’s really important to get that information out to all New Yorkers.”He also declared on Twitter “I’m encouraging New Yorkers to go on with your lives and get out on the town despite Coronavirus.”March 3The city had its second confirmed coronavirus case a 50-year-old man who lived in Westchester County. Tracing his travels and contacts sends investigators to “a hospital in Bronxville N.Y. to a synagogue in nearby New Rochelle to a law firm and a college campus in Manhattan and to Florida where the man had visited weeks ago.”During a press availability the mayor declared “So again want to come back to this point occasional contact glancing contact temporary contact it does not from everything we know about coronavirus lead to transmission. It needs to be prolonged you know if not intimate at least prolonged constant contact.”March 4Medical investigators found nine new cases in New York including “the Westchester man’s wife; his son a 20-year-old college student in Manhattan; his daughter 14; and a neighbor who drove the man to the hospital.”Health Commissioner Bardot tells reporters “There’s no indication that being in a car being in the subways with someone who’s potentially sick is a risk factor because again it goes back to the issue of casual contact.”March 5Mayor de Blasio and city officials held another briefing and he stopped contending the virus could not be spread by casual contact. He declared “In the case of these two individuals neither one had a connection to the areas affected in other parts of the world. So there no travel nexus. Neither one connected to any of the other cases we’ve seen. Our disease detectives are working with their families right away on mapping their contacts. And we’ll have more to say on that shortly and we’ll obviously be following up with any close contacts. The community-spread issue — we are seeking a guidance from the World Health Organization and from the CDC now that it’s clearly established as a phenomenon here.”In a dramatic shift de Blasio declared “What we do know is when you have a community-spread dynamic you have to assume it could be anywhere in the city. So we are going to work on an assumption of the intense vigilance.” Health Commissioner Bardot directed anyone arriving in the city from China Iran Italy South Korea or Japan to isolate themselves for 14 days.March 6New York’s City Hall secured its first order for emergency protective gear masks and hand sanitizer according to the city comptroller’s office.The mayor issued a new warning to the city: “Obviously this is a new reality of community spread. So the fact is even compared to a few days ago we have a very different reality. When we began the week our focus was on people who had traveled to affected countries overseas and those who had come in contact with people who traveled to those countries. What’s happened in just the last few days is the initiation of community spread meaning that these cases now are coming from within our communities in an untraceable fashion.”The mayor added “I really believe New Yorkers are heeding these warnings and acting accordingly. I just continue to see people doing the right thing and I appreciate that very very much. So I also would tell you the vast majority of places I’m going in the city I’m seeing people going about their business.”During a radio interview de Blasio shifted a bit back to this previous tone on casual contact with strangers: “If someone’s on the same train car as another person that does not from what we know so far create a dynamic where you have an opportunity to catch this disease. It’s just a different reality. What we’re seeing — look at what we’re seeing so far. It’s people in close contact. And again we’ll keep updating that. But what we’ve seen so far facts on the ground it is people in close contact.”March 8At a press conference De Blasio discouraged handshakes and demonstrated the “elbow tap” with Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro. The mayor also offered some contradictory advice on public events: “Based on the information we have today we are not not altering our stance on public events. But we are making clear people I think it’s straightforward and obvious but it bears being said in a straightforward fashion. If you are sick you shouldn’t be going to a public event. If you are sick you shouldn’t be going to work. If you’re sick you shouldn’t be going on the subway. Now if you are not sick but you’re in that particularly vulnerable category over 50 preexisting conditions you should avoid unnecessary public activity.”Beyond that recommendation large public gatherings were still permitted.March 9Overseas Italy announced its nationwide quarantine. Appearing on CNN de Blasio said “What I would say is we should not want to do with all due respect to Italy we try not to get to that level. We try and be more pinpoint in our response. Our subway is unusual because you are talking about a huge number of people packed in close. We’re trying to get folks to spread that out. So we’re saying to employers if you can stagger work hours that’d be helpful. If some people can telecommute and it does not disrupt business that’s helpful. But mainly the point is go about your business. Take those basic precautions washing your hands regularly covering your mouth when you sneeze or cough.”The mayor also elaborated on his reluctance to close city schools: “Vast majority of parents I’ve spoken to over the years in any crisis don’t want to see the schools closed. Of course safety first but they depend on the schools they are a safe place for their kids and by the way they want their kids to keep getting educated. So to me it’s a high bar for a closure.”March 11During a press conference Mayor de Blasio said he is “telling people to not avoid restaurants not avoid normal things that people do. . . . If you’re not sick you should be going about your life.” (The city was four days away from the announcement that the city was closing all schools.)But elsewhere in the press conference explaining why the city was asking employers to stagger work hours de Blasio said “It’s just trying to take away the dynamics where people are on in unusually close circumstances like a crowded New York City subway car in rush hour where you know God forbid someone coughs or sneezes and can’t get their elbow up in time. You know you could be right there in front of them. That’s a real thing.” Later the mayor added “I remind you all we went through Ebola and there were people who are scared because the one patient in the Ebola — and this is an absolutely you know Ebola makes if I could be so cold coronavirus look like a walk in the park.”That evening the mayor issued a brief statement in response to President Trump’s address to the nation accusing the president of “minimizing what has now become a global pandemic.”The NBA suspended its regular season and actor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson announced they had tested positive for coronavirus.March 12Appearing on CNN de Blasio offered some rare praise for the president: “I accept the notion of travel bans in this environment. So I disagree with President Trump on many things but actually I think the travel-ban piece of his strategy has been in many ways warranted. It does not replace a proactive strategy by the United States of America to address our own issues because we have our own community spread now.” He repeated that he was reluctant to close schools because so many parents cannot work with their children at home and that for some students school is their only source of guaranteed meals and other basic services.During his daily press conference the mayor said “We receive extraordinary new information on what now literally feels like an hourly basis. . . . Literally yesterday morning feels like a long time ago.”March 15New York City closed all schools. The initial announcement was that schools would be closed until April 20; the widespread expectation from city officials was that schools would remain closed until the end of the school year. Later that evening the city announced that bars and restaurants must shut down as well switching to only takeout and delivery.March 16The New York Times reported that for the past week the mayor’s “top aides were furiously trying to change the mayor’s approach to the coronavirus outbreak. There had been arguments and shouting matches between the mayor and some of his advisers; some top health officials had even threatened to resign if he refused to accept the need to close schools and businesses according to several people familiar with the internal discussions.”Hours before all gyms in New York had to close Mayor de Blasio had one final workout at the gym at his local YMCA. Even his former staffers offered scathing criticism.5Rebecca Katz a former special adviser whom the mayor once called a metaphorical member of his family declared “No current or former staff member should be asked to defend this. The mayor’s actions today are inexcusable and reckless.” Jonathan Rosen once one of de Blasio’s closest allies called the mayor’s gym visit “pathetic self-involved inexcusable.”NowAs of the morning of Friday March 27 New York City’s coronavirus death toll hit 365. The city’s number of confirmed cases is 23112 jumping 3101 cases from the day before. Makeshift morgues are set up outside the hospitals in refrigerated trailers. New York City doctors were describing the situation as “hell . . . the system is overwhelmed . . . worse than 9/11.”
466,Don’t Let the Chinese Communist Party Use the Coronavirus to Its Advantage,Michael Sobolik,The National Review,2,https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/coronavirus-pandemic-chinese-communist-party-trying-escape-blame-take-advantage-recovery/,When it comes to the global coronavirus pandemic the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is acting as both the arsonist and the firefighter.The first response of China’s authoritarian government was intimidation. The CCP actively suppressed knowledge of the virus’s existence in Wuhan by silencing physicians and prohibiting medical professionals from publishing findings that could have saved lives. When the party could no longer deny the viral outbreak it dithered in December and January as cases of the disease in Wuhan and neighboring cities skyrocketed caring more about its monopoly on power than the welfare of its people. And in February as the coronavirus spread throughout the world foreign minister Wang Yi pressured neighboring countries to keep travel with the People’s Republic of China (PRC) open for reputational reasons. Now however China is seeking to whitewash its failings — and blame the virus on other nations such as the United States.That historical context is important. According to a study at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom had China’s political leaders acted quickly they could have lowered the number of cases within their own country by 95 percent. Instead the party’s political paranoia turned a localized viral outbreak into a global crisis with over 22000 deaths reported worldwide. According to the International Monetary Fund the global economic impact of coronavirus will approximate that of the Great Recession of 2008 and possibly surpass it.That however is only if the figures we now see coming out of China are accurate. Given the CCP’s reputation of altering figures for its political benefit the death toll and economic impact are likely far worse.As it stands the institutional failure of China’s government is stress-testing the health-care systems of every nation on earth. Italy’s hospitals are overwhelmed and the United States is on pace to run out of ventilators in four weeks. In Iran one person is dying every ten seconds from COVID-19.NOW WATCH: 'Trump Says US Is Best Prepared To Fight The Coronavirus'WATCH: 0:30Trump Says US Is Best Prepared To Fight The CoronavirusAmid this crisis the CCP today is hard at work — not to right its wrongs but to rewrite the past. The party is waging a multi-front propaganda campaign that shifts the blame for coronavirus to the United States while claiming that China’s response bought time for the rest of the world to prepare. The Chinese government is also presenting itself as a global health provider shipping face masks and test kits to nations with shortages.Of course China is right to give this medical equipment to nations in need. But its government is bundling misinformation with this aid.These lies serve a higher purpose for the party: turning coronavirus into a net positive for the CCP. Consulting firm Horizon Advocacy published a report last week based on Chinese government and state media sources that details China’s plan to position its economy in strategic sectors to box out other industrialized nations still reeling from the virus’s impact. According to China’s State Administration of Science Technology and Industry for National Defense China must jumpstart its economy to “pave the way for international market expansion after the epidemic is over.”Policymakers in Washington should take this gambit seriously. But they shouldn’t assume that America’s friends and partners do. In recent years China — working via companies such as Huawei and through its much publicized “Belt and Road Initiative” — has greatly expanded its global economic footprint. Yet far too many of China’s trading partners remain blind to the true nature of China’s political system and the threat it poses.The United States must blunt the CCP’s disinformation campaign. Doing so begins with fostering unity at home.To date most public debate in the United States has centered around President Trump’s decision to call COVID-19 the “Chinese virus.” The president did not choose his words out of racist animus — nor did countless journalists and pundits who used the same phrase throughout the month of January — but in response to CCP propaganda.Yet the phrase while accurate fails to distinguish between the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party. The citizens of China are not the instigators of this crisis but rather the first victims of the party’s self-interested response to it.This distinction is more than public-relations messaging; it is a critical nuance that American leaders must internalize. We cannot stand up to the CCP if we fail to differentiate between victims and victimizers — just as Americans cannot unite the world while assuming the worst about one another.6The Chinese Communist Party started this fire. But they are angling to emerge from its ashes as a savior. While acknowledging its current helpful efforts Americans must stand together and call the party what it is: an instigator.
467,Cutting GDP to Counter the Coronavirus Pandemic,Robert Barro,The National Review,2,https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/coronavirus-response-will-curbing-economic-activity-to-slow-virus-work/#slide-1,Across the West that's the implicit strategy.One of the main policy responses to the coronavirus pandemic has been to curb economic activity as a way of reducing the contagion’s spread. I would characterize this policy as a decision to reduce U.S. and world GDP in the short run by roughly 20 percent. In essence this is a voluntarily implemented negative supply shock akin to a sudden loss in productivity. The world’s annual GDP today is around $100 trillion so a 20 percent cut sustained for a year would be about $20 trillion roughly the annual GDP of the United States. For the moment I assume that it is a good policy choice to engineer this reduction in GDP by $20 trillion worldwide $4 trillion of which is accounted for by the United States.What are reasonable monetary and fiscal responses to this fall in GDP? The usual idea would be to consider forms of economic stimulus that raise aggregate demand and therefore offset the fall in GDP during a recession. But this reasoning does not apply here because we have already determined that a sharp short-term reduction in GDP — for example by 20 percent for a year — is a good idea. From this perspective it is puzzling that the Federal Reserve recently cut its main short-term nominal interest rate to zero and also implemented large-scale asset purchases. If the Fed’s actions stimulate the economy and thereby offset the fall in GDP we would not regard that as a good thing because the resulting increase in economic activity would presumably lead to an increase in the virus’s spread. Moreover the present environment contains a serious threat of inflation — from the negative supply shock — and the Fed’s expansionary response will exacerbate that threat.The only way I have come up with to rationalize the Fed’s rate cut is that a sharp rise in disaster probability has dramatically lowered safe real interest rates manifested in the fall in yields on U.S. Treasuries throughout the range of maturities. From this perspective the drop in the overnight rate on federal funds is just following the general decline in market nominal interest rates on U.S. Treasuries.Various forms of expansionary fiscal policy are also being considered worldwide. In the United States Congress’s recent package includes the federal government’s giving most adults a check of $1200. To the extent that this kind of policy succeeds in raising aggregate demand and thereby GDP it raises the same problems as the Fed’s aggressive monetary policy. In the current environment we do not want to offset the 20 percent fall in GDP through inflationary fiscal policies; we want to stop the virus’s spread.The threat of inflation is especially worrisome because if it finally returns it could well be accompanied by widespread price controls even worse than those of the early 1970s. One can just imagine politicians starting with the president complaining about the injustice in companies’ raising prices during an emergency and insisting that the federal government will not allow them to do so.A smarter policy response would aim to prevent individuals who lose jobs from having little income to use for basic purchases. One reasonable way to do that is strengthening the existing social safety net. Notably it makes sense to increase accessibility and benefit levels for programs such as unemployment insurance food stamps and Medicaid. These program expansions some of which are in the massive relief package that just passed Congress are much more targeted to the needy than the policy of passing out $1200 checks to everyone.NOW WATCH: 'Senator Sold Up To $1.5m In Stock While Downplaying Pandemic'WATCH: 0:49Senator Sold Up To $1.5m In Stock While Downplaying PandemicIt also makes sense that the recent package includes various policies aimed at limiting the permanent disappearance of businesses that would be productive absent the ongoing crisis. And it’s critical for the Federal Reserve to prevent major disruptions of financial markets which it is already aggressively attempting to do.As for the question hanging over all of this: Is it wise to engineer a 20 percent decline in GDP under these circumstances? Two things matter here: How much does one value the potential reductions in mortality this policy could give us and how much does the policy actually succeed in lowering mortality? The Great Influenza Pandemic of 1918–1920 which had a worldwide mortality rate of 2 percent can serve as a baseline for answering both questions. Two percent of the world’s current population is roughly 150 million people which we can use as a very rough upper bound for the number of lives that could be saved worldwide by curbing the ongoing pandemic.To place a monetary value on the prevention of 150 million deaths it is natural to make use of the extensive literature on the value of a statistical life. This research attaches monetary values to safety and health measures that reduce expected mortality giving particular weight to the wage premium that workers require to accept riskier jobs. Typical recent estimates for the United States are around $10 million per life but much lower numbers around $1 million apply in poorer countries. Even at the lower figure of $1 million saving 150 million lives is worth $150 trillion about 1.5 years’ of world GDP. In contrast a 20 percent fall in the world’s GDP — if sustained for a year — is only about $20 trillion. So if the policy of cutting world GDP by 20 percent actually saves 150 million people then it is more than worth the cost.Much harder to know is whether the ongoing policy of constraining economic activity will actually hold back the spread of the pandemic and lead thereby to saving that many lives. The answer to that question should become a lot clearer in the weeks ahead as we learn more about the dynamics of the coronavirus’s spread.
468,The Cipher as Presidential Candidate,Rich Lowry,The National Review,2,https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/joe-biden-generic-presidential-candidate/#slide-1,If the party had decided to order up a generic representative it couldn’t have done any better than Joe Biden.What William McKinley was to the front-porch campaign Joe Biden is to the basement campaign.Sidelined and confined to his house by the dictates of coronavirus social distancing the former vice president has been limited to intermittent appearances from a makeshift studio in his basement. They have been awkward and low-energy but that doesn’t really set them apart from most other Joe Biden appearances.If there’s any candidate who could thrive by having very limited public exposure and existing mostly as a line of a ballot it’s the longtime presidential aspirant who hadn’t won a primary until a couple of weeks ago.Biden is winning the Democratic nomination on the basis of not being Bernie Sanders and wants to get elected president on the basis of not being Donald Trump. He’s as purely a negative candidate as we’ve seen in a very long time running largely on who he isn’t and what he won’t do.He’s the presidential candidate as cipher.Prior to his recent mini media tour did anyone seriously miss Joe Biden? Wonder what he had to say? Expect him to come up with a bold captivating coronavirus plan or an arresting formulation?There is no Biden movement. For much of the primary campaign he couldn’t build a crowd to save his life. He had no organization or money.There is no Biden charisma. He’s not young handsome eloquent or interesting.There is no Biden catchphrase. He doesn’t have “hope and change” or “make America great again.”For decades he’s stayed reliably within the mainstream of the Democratic Party at any given time — hence his recent turn further left — and his views have largely reflected center-left conventional wisdom.If the party had decided to order up a generic representative with nothing original to say and a campaign utterly untouched by new thinking or methods it couldn’t have done any better than Joe Biden.He’s led on everything across the past four decades at least according to his own account and yet has done nothing particularly memorable.He’s the opposite of a fresh face on the scene without an extensive record to defend — think George W. Bush or Barack Obama. But he’s proving that a very old slate can be almost as invulnerable to attack as a blank slate.The length of his career means that most of his past controversial positions lost their political salience long ago. They are such artifacts of another era that they can’t be used against him anymore.Kamala Harris learned this when she executed a fruitless ambush on Biden on the 40-year-old issue of busing. President Donald Trump will hit Biden on the crime bill which passed more than a quarter of a century ago and his vote for the second Iraq War Biden’s most contemporary legislative vulnerability since he took the vote less than two decades ago.Biden’s candidacy holds interest only to the extent he is gaffe-prone. His misfires aren’t Hillary Clinton–style gaffes laced with arrogance and an insulting dismissiveness that makes them a rallying cry for the other side (e.g. “deplorables”).Instead Biden’s verbal tangles incomplete sentences and weird mix-ups are amusing — and concerning. They will be used to argue that he isn’t up to the job but they don’t make anyone hate Biden. He can’t even generate strong feelings in his partisan opposition.All that said Biden deserves credit for his insight that the Democratic Party wasn’t defined by woke Twitter and that Obama-Biden Democrats as he calls them still constituted the party’s center of gravity. He correctly believed — or hoped — that African-American voters would see him through.His victories on Super Tuesday and afterward showed that Democrats were willing to turn out en masse for an uninspired candidacy and it may be that the same dynamic will hold in November.If so Biden could do worse than stay in his basement for the duration.
469,Goodbye Green New Deal,Kevin Williamson,The National Review,2,https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/goodbye-green-new-deal/,After a couple of weeks of great economic sacrifice it's already proving hard for Americans to take. No one will sign up for a lifetime of it.What will happen next with the coronavirus epidemic is unknown but it seems certain to claim one very high-profile victim: the so-called Green New Deal.Good riddance.The current crisis in the U.S. economy is in miniature but concentrated form precisely what the Left has in mind in response to climate change: shutting down large sectors of the domestic and global economies through official writ social pressure and indirect means in response to a crisis with potentially devastating and wide-ranging consequences for human life and human flourishing.What is under way right now in response to the epidemic is in substance much like the Green New Deal and lesser versions of the same climate-change agenda: massive new government spending political control of critical industries emergency protocols modeled on wartime practice etc.But the characters of the two crises are basically different.Set aside for the moment any reservations you might have about the coronavirus-emergency regime and set aside your views on climate change too whatever they may be. Instead ask yourself this: If Americans are this resistant to paying a large economic price to enable measures meant to prevent a public-health catastrophe in the here and now — one that threatens the lives of people they know and love — then how much less likely are they to bear not weeks or months but decades of disruption and economic dislocation and a permanently diminished standard of living in order to prevent possibly severe consequences to people in Bangladesh or Indonesia 80 or 100 years from now?NOW WATCH: 'Economic Powers Vow to Fight Crisis'WATCH: 0:40Economic Powers Vow to Fight CrisisFor years we’ve been hearing “This is climate change” and “That is climate change” every time there’s a flood or a storm. If that’s the fact then climate change is relatively speaking manageable. There is no way Americans—or people around the world—are going to agree to endure anything like the current economic downturn in order to prevent problems of that nature.Without failing to appreciate the severe immediate economic consequences being felt by Americans in this episode asking retail and service-industry workers to forfeit their incomes for a few months until their establishments can reopen is a relatively manageable thing even if we are (as I believe we should be) very liberal in doing what we can to protect them financially in the meantime. Telling everybody who works in coal oil natural gas petrochemicals plastics and refineries — and a great many people who work in automobiles aviation shipping utilities construction agriculture manufacturing food processing utilities and dozens of other fields — that their companies and their jobs are going away forever is a much larger thing. Telling everybody who does business with those people that they’ll have to consult Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez for solvents and industrial polymers — and you know lights — would send waves of chaos rippling around the world hard and so fast that you’d need Tom Araya to properly give voice to them.“Oh but we’ll find them jobs in the new green economy!” comes the response. “It’ll be a net positive!” As though petroleum engineers were lumps of labor that could be reshaped at will by a committee of lawyers in Washington if only we gave them the power. Nobody is buying that. Not many people are that stupid.As I wrote at the beginning of this outbreak Americans are hard to quarantine. We may yet end up paying a very heavy price for that — in some circumstances a non-compliance rate of 20 percent (i.e. if every fifth person is a knucklehead) will have effects quite similar to a non-compliance rate of 95 percent. A 51 percent majority works in a city-council election but an effective social-distancing regimen requires much more.Those spring-break clowns down in Florida and the “coronavirus party” doofuses in Kentucky are We the People too and if they are not willing to spend a couple of weeks watching Netflix to save grandma’s life — or their own lives — then do you really think they’re going to take an economic bullet over the prospect of losing 3 percent of world economic output a century from now to global-warming-mitigation costs?What we are seeing right now is what it looks like when Washington tries to steer the economy. There are times when that is necessary and this is one of those times. But emergencies do not last forever and emergency measures should be by nature temporary. The attraction of the climate-change crusade is that it creates a permanent state of emergency. The Left wants very much to convince Americans that climate change presents an emergency of the same kind requiring the same “moral equivalent of war” worldwide mobilization.3One suspects that the people who are missing their paychecks right now and the ones who worry that they may be missing them soon are going to need some convincing. The adverse effects of climate change are likely to be significant and may prove severe — as noted many of our progressive friends insist that they already are. But we have a new point of comparison and those challenges feel relatively manageable if the alternative is an extended version of the coronavirus shutdown — and no amount of marketing will change the fact that that is precisely what is being advocated.A couple of months of this is going to be very hard to take. Nobody is signing up for a lifetime of it.

471,‘Simply to Win an Election’,ALEXANDRA DESANCTIS,The National Review,2,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/simply-to-win-an-election/?utm_source=recirc-desktop&utm_medium=homepage&utm_campaign=right-rail&utm_content=corner&utm_term=second,Last week Representative Dan Lipinski lost the Democratic primary in the third district of Illinois to Marie Newman a progressive challenger who unlike Lipinski supports legal abortion on demand. In a news conference the day after his defeat Lipinski addressed the elephant in the room: his refusal to flip-flop on his pro-life convictions.“Over the years I’ve watched many other politicians succumb to pressure and change their position on this issue” he said last Wednesday. “I have always said that I would never give up being pro-life and standing up for babies in the womb. . . . I could never give up protecting the most vulnerable human beings in the world simply to win an election.”In an opinion article earlier this week published in the Wall Street Journal Lipinski reflected on these comments at greater length and pro-life advocates should take a couple of minutes to read it in full. Here’s just a bit of what he wrote:Abortion advocacy groups poured millions into my opponent’s campaign. If I had simply changed my position on abortion there probably wouldn’t have been a contest. Abortion proponents wanted to hear me express regret about sticking with my pro-life beliefs. . . .[At the news conference] Politico’s Shia Kapos posed this question: “There are some pro-life Democrats like Tim Kaine who have found a way to come to terms with the fact that they do not believe in abortion but they also support a woman’s right to choose so they have been able to kind of maneuver—there isn’t just black and white there is some flexibility. Did Tim Kaine ever talk to you about that?”I replied that if you believe life exists in the womb you have to support policies that protect that life.Lipinski might not be returning to Congress next January but at least he can take pride in being a man of conviction who doesn’t throw out his principles when they become inconvenient.

The tests can produce a result in 10 or 15 minutes but are usually less accurate than other tests. Because of the high error rate the country will continue to rely on conventional laboratory tests of which they perform about 900 a day.The country’s Health Ministry paid $546000 for 100000 of the test kits while the Interior Ministry paid for the other 50000.Deputy Prime Minister and Interior Minister Jan Hamacek downplayed the discovery that many of the tests were faulty blaming it on a possible wrong methodology and saying the kits can still be used “when the disease has been around for some time” or when “someone returns after quarantine after fourteen days.”“In my opinion this is not about some scandalous revelation that it is not working” Hamacek said.Meanwhile Spain which has more than 56000 infected people and more than 4000 coronavirus deaths the second-highest number of fatalities in the world after Italy found that the rapid coronavirus test kits it purchased from Chinese company Bioeasy only correctly identified 30 percent of virus cases according to Spanish newspaper El Pais.The director Spain’s Center for Health Alerts and Emergencies Fernando Simón said Spain tested 9000 of the test kits and will return them based on their high error rate.10Studies performed on the tests which discovered the high error rate caused the Spanish Society of Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology to recommend officially that the tests not be used.The Chinese embassy in Spain claimed the Bioeasy products are not included in the products China has been supplying to countries where the virus has broken out.
474,Trump lashes out at General Motors over ventilator shortage,Ebony Bowden,The New York Post,2,https://nypost.com/2020/03/27/trump-lashes-out-at-general-motors-over-ventilator-shortage/,WASHINGTON — President Trump on Friday lashed into General Motors over a critical shortage of lifesaving ventilators amid the coronavirus pandemic — tweeting “FORD GET GOING ON VENTILATORS FAST!!!!!!”In a series of tweets the president accused the automaker and its CEO Mary Barra of slow-walking and threatened to use the Defense Production Act which would allow him to compel private companies to retool their factories to meet demand.“As usual with ‘this’ General Motors things just never seem to work out. They said they were going to give us 40000 much needed Ventilators ‘very quickly’. Now they are saying it will only be 6000 in late April and they want top dollar” he wrote before upbraiding Barra as “a mess.”“General Motors MUST immediately open their stupidly abandoned Lordstown plant in Ohio or some other plant and START MAKING VENTILATORS NOW!!!!!! FORD GET GOING ON VENTILATORS FAST!!!!!!”The tweet followed a New York Times article published Thursday evening reporting that the White House called off a $1 billion deal with General Motors that would have allowed the automaker to build as many as 80000 desperately needed ventilators.According to the report the announcement slated for this past Wednesday was canceled when the Federal Emergency Management Agency balked at the high price tag and said it needed more time to assess the deal.Trump has repeatedly called on automakers such as Tesla and General Motors to help as officials like New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo cry out for the ventilators calling it a matter of life and death as the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to overwhelm Big Apple hospitals.In an interview with “Hannity” on Fox News Thursday evening the president questioned Cuomo’s request for 30000 ventilators downplaying the dire situation in the hard-hit Empire State.“I have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they’re going to be” Trump said.“I don’t believe you need 40000 or 30000 ventilators” Trump continued. “You know you go into major hospitals sometimes they’ll have two ventilators and now all of a sudden they’re saying ‘Can we order 30000 ventilators?'”The federal government this week pledged to send 4000 ventilators to New York.

Thomas Massie said Friday he will force a roll call vote on the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill — delaying passage of the bill by forcing lawmakers to show up in person.Massie a libertarian MIT-educated engineer immediately became the most-hated man in Washington as hundreds of lawmakers crowded into the House chamber despite fears of spreading COVID-19.“What a dumbass” Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan told Rep. Sean Maloney (D-NY) as they passed on Capitol Hill.“Breaking news: Congressman Massie has tested positive for being an asshole” tweeted former Democratic Secretary of State John Kerry who added “#Masshole (Finally something the president and I can agree on!)”Massie requested time to explain himself on the House floor approaching House Ways and Means Committee ranking member Rep. Kevin Brady (R-Texas) as debate time dwindled. He was refused.“Are they afraid of the truth?” Massie wrote on Twitter. “I’ve been told that they don’t even have 1 minute available for me to speak against this bill during the 4 hour debate. The fix is in. If this bill is so great for America why not allow a vote on it? Why not have a real debate? #SWAMP”Massie confirmed he would force the roll call vote even after President Trump called for him to be thrown out of the Republican Party for considering the move.“I swore an oath to uphold the constitution and I take that oath seriously” Massie wrote on Twitter. “In a few moments I will request a vote on the CARES Act which means members of Congress will vote on it by pushing ‘yes’ or ‘no’ or ‘present.'”Massie wrote that the Constitution requires a quorum — 50 percent attendance or 215 members — for legislation to pass and that he will raise a point of order to enforce the rule.It’s possible that there are enough lawmakers in Washington to pass the bill Friday afternoon. But if the threshold is not met House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) could schedule a weekend vote.Explaining his opposition to the package on Twitter Massie noted the $2 trillion will be added on top of $4 trillion in stimulus already underway by the Federal Reserve.“If getting us into $6 trillion more debt doesn’t matter then why are we not getting $350 trillion more in debt so that we can give a check of $1 million to every person in the country?” Massie wrote.He added: “This stimulus should go straight to the people rather than being funneled through banks and corporations like this bill is doing. … 2 trillion divided by 150 million workers is about $13333.00 per person. That’s much more than the $1200 per person check authorized by this bill.”Massie also deflected blame on Pelosi who unveiled a rival 1400-page package this week that Republicans blamed Monday for upsetting an initial compromise forcing more negotiations and changes.“This bill should have been voted on much sooner in both the Senate and House and it shouldn’t be stuffed full of Nancy Pelosi’s pork- including $25 million for the Kennedy Center grants for the National Endowment for the Humanities and Arts and millions more” Massie wrote.Trump’s mounting fury at Massie boiled over in a pair of tweets as the House prepared to vote before noon on the stimulus bundle which was approved unanimously by the Senate on Wednesday.“Looks like a third rate Grandstander named @RepThomasMassie a Congressman from unfortunately a truly GREAT State Kentucky wants to vote against the new Save Our Workers Bill in Congress” Trump wrote on Twitter.Trump continued: “He just wants the publicity. He can’t stop it only delay which is both dangerous & costly. Workers & small businesses need money now in order to survive. Virus wasn’t their fault. It is ‘HELL’ dealing with the Dems had to give up some stupid things in order to get the ‘big picture’ done. 90% GREAT! WIN BACK HOUSE but throw Massie out of Republican Party!”Massie has been in office since 2012. His closest allies include Sen. Rand Paul a close Republican ally of Trump and the first senator to contract coronavirus and Michigan Rep. Justin Amash who became an independent last year and voted to impeach Trump.

So she walked to a small local clinic for treatment and then went back to work — likely spreading the contagion.“I felt a bit tired but not as tired as previous years” she told The Paper according to a translation by news.com.au. “Every winter I always suffer from the flu. So I thought it was the flu.”She visited a local clinic on Dec. 11 and received an injection but didn’t feel any better so she went to the Eleventh Hospital in Wuhan.“The doctor at the Eleventh Hospital could not figure out what was wrong with me and gave me pills” Wei told the Chinese outlet — but those didn’t work either.“By then I felt a lot worse and very uncomfortable” Wei said. “I did not have the strength or energy.”On Dec. 16 Wei went to Wuhan Union Hospital — one of the city’s biggest — to get checked out.A doctor there described her illness as “ruthless” and told her several other people from the same market had already come in with similar symptoms.Enlarge ImageMedical staff treat a COVID-19 coronavirus patient at a hospital in Wuhan.Medical staff treat a COVID-19 patient at a hospital in Wuhan.AFP via Getty ImagesBy the end of the month she was quarantined when doctors finally established the link between the emerging bug and the seafood market the Chinese outlet reported.A Dec. 31 statement from the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission revealed that Wei was among the first 27 patients to test positive for COVID-19 and one of 24 cases with direct links to the seafood market.Wei who has since recovered and left the hospital in January said she thinks she contracted the infection from a market toilet in the market she shared with meat sellers and others according to the Journal.The vendors who worked on either side of Wei along with one of her daughters a niece and the niece’s husband also caught the deadly bug the paper reported.“A lot fewer people would have died” in the country if the government had acted sooner Wei told the Journal in February.Wei may have been “patient zero” at the market but it’s still unclear if she was the first person to ever contract the novel coronavirus in the country.Security guards patrol outside the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market.AFP via Getty ImagesSince the start of the outbreak 81897 COVID-19 cases have been reported in China Johns Hopkins University data shows. Worldwide more than half a million have been infected.The US is the new epicenter of the outbreak with at least 85996 cases.
477,Coronavirus likely to kill 81K in US over next four months study warns,Lee Brown,The New York Post,2,https://nypost.com/2020/03/27/coronavirus-likely-to-kill-81k-in-us-over-next-four-months-study-warns/,The coronavirus is likely to kill more than 81000 people in the US over the next four months — but the death toll could be twice that if precautions like social distancing are relaxed too soon according to an alarming new study.Deaths from the contagion are largely expected to peak in the second week of April — later in states where the spread is off to a slower start — and will likely still cause deaths until July an analysis by the University of Washington School of Medicine forecasts.The final death toll is unlikely to be less than 38000 nationally and could be as high as 162000 — with the team predicting the most likely number to be 81114 deaths.The study — using data from governments hospitals and other sources — admits that the estimated 81000 deaths “is an alarming number.”But it warns that the toll could “be substantially higher if excess demand for health system resources is not addressed and if social distancing policies are not vigorously implemented and enforced across all states.”A key lesson is that social distancing should be kept in place longer than initially expected — and only relaxed if the US can more effectively test and quarantine the sick said Dr. Christopher Murray director of the Institute for Health Metrics who led the study.“The trajectory of the pandemic will change — and dramatically for the worse — if people ease up on social distancing or relax with other precautions” Murray said.However even with lockdowns and social distancing the terrifying spread of the bug across the nation is likely to completely overwhelm hospitals and the much-needed supply of beds.“That demand for health services is going to exceed the available capacity of beds and particularly ICU bed days” Murray said.“The national level is really quite profound” he warned predicting a shortage of more than 64000 beds across the US — some 17000 of them in ICUs — needed during the peak.The United States has reported around 70000 cases of COVID-19 and more than 900 deaths since January. Globally it has infected more than half a million people according to data from Johns Hopkins University.The University of Washington has been at the center of the outbreak in United States which first was detected in the state of Washington and has so far killed 100 people in that state according to date from Johns Hopkins University.
478,Andrew Cuomo tells New York to ‘kick coronovirus’ ass’,Julia Marsh Bernadette Hogan and Bruce Golding,The New York Post,2,https://nypost.com/2020/03/27/coronavirus-in-ny-cuomo-wants-four-more-temporary-hospitals/,Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Friday called on New Yorkers to “kick coronavirus’ ass” as the state braces for the anticipated “apex” of the crisis in three weeks.The call to arms came as Cuomo said the state’s death toll from the disease had reached 519 and would continue to rise because the prognosis for the most seriously sick victims was so grim.“We go out there today and we kick coronavirus’ ass that’s what I say and we’re gonna save lives and New York is going to thank you” Cuomo declared during a news conference at Manhattan’s Javits Center.Cuomo said he would ask President Trump later Friday “if he will authorize another four temporary hospitals for us” so there can be one each in all five boroughs as well as Nassau Suffolk and Westchester counties.Cuomo also said he was even considering converting the swank New York Marriott at the Brooklyn Bridge hotel for use as an emergency medical facility.The four sites that will go to Trump for approval are the Brooklyn cruise terminal Aqueduct Racetrack in Queens the New York Expo Center in The Bronx and the College of Staten Island he said.The state has already received permission — and work is underway — to put a total of 4000 hospital beds at the Javits Center in Manhattan SUNY Old Westbury in Nassau Stonybrook in Suffolk and the Westchester County Center in White Plains.The state is also desperately collecting N95 respirators protective gowns coveralls and ventilators.“We want to do everything we can to be ready for that increased capacity that could hit us in 21 days” Cuomo said.“We’re creating a stockpile of this equipment so if and when the apex hits we can deploy equipment from the stockpile to whatever region of the state or whatever hospital needs it.”But Cuomo also warned that the state had yet to suffer its worst losses from the deadly pandemic.“That is going to continue to go up and that is the worst possible news that I could tell the people in the state of New York” Cuomo said.“The longer you are on a ventilator the less likely you are going to come off that ventilator.”He added “It’s bad news it’s tragic news it’s the worst news — but it’s not unexpected news either.”
479,Woman dies days after sister became first Illinois coronavirus death,Joshua Rhett Miller,The New York Post,2,https://nypost.com/2020/03/27/woman-dies-days-after-sister-became-first-illinois-coronavirus-death/,An older sister of Illinois’ first coronavirus victim has also died from the disease according to reports.Wanda Bailey 63 of Crete died Wednesday at a hospital in Olympia Fields nine days after COVID-19 claimed the life of her younger sister Patricia Frieson a 61-year-old retired nurse who marked the state’s first known coronavirus fatality on March 16 the Chicago Tribune reports.Bailey died of pneumonia due to COVID-19 infection with heart disease hypertension and lung disease as contributing factors officials from the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office told the newspaper.It’s unclear how Bailey — one of nine siblings — got infected because she largely stayed at home due to her health problems brother Richard Frieson said.But Bailey and her sister — who lived on Chicago’s South Side — did attend church together the newspaper reports citing social media posts.Richard Frieson told the Tribune last week that a second sister of his had been hospitalized for respiratory issues but he declined to identify her.“We’re all very close” Frieson said adding that his sisters hung out regularly.Relatives were “hopeful” the second sibling would recover while in the hospital Frieson said previously adding that other family members were staying in isolation with the assumption they also had been infected.Bailey is survived by her husband and at least one son a family friend told the Chicago Sun-Times.Her brother Anthony Frieson acknowledged Bailey’s death on social media late Wednesday saying the family lost “another beautiful soul” the Sun-Times reports.“Pat and Wanda loved their family and more importantly loved their Lord” the post read. “In a blink of an eye life can change. Please continue to pray for our family.”
480,Texas man threatened to kill Nancy Pelosi over coronavirus aid: feds,Joshua Rhett Miller,The New York Post,2,https://nypost.com/2020/03/27/texas-man-threatened-to-kill-nancy-pelosi-over-coronavirus-aid/,A Texas man threatened to kill US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi over the congressional response to the coronavirus outbreak saying she and other Democrats “need to be removed at any cost necessary” federal authorities said.Gavin Weslee Blake Perry 27 of Wichita Falls accused Pelosi on his Facebook page Monday of being part of a satanic cult as well as other Democratic lawmakers who work closely with her the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Texas announced Thursday.“Dems of the establishment will be removed at any cost necessary and yes that means by death” Perry wrote Monday in the post which was still online early Friday.The ominous post included a link to a story from a pro-life outlet accusing Pelosi of trying to include abortion funding in the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package Perry’s Facebook profile shows.In another public post earlier Monday Perry urged people to “use live rounds” and an abbreviation for “shoot on sight” while targeting Democrats prosecutors said.“If youre a dem or apart of the establishment in the democrats side I view you as a criminal and a terrorists and I advise everyone to Go SOS and use live rounds” Perry wrote alongside a screenshot of a tweet by New York Sen. Chuck Schumer criticizing President Trump’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. “Shoot to kill. This is a revolution.”Perry who made his initial court appearance Thursday has been charged with transmitting a threatening communication in interstate commerce. If convicted he faces up to five years in prison.Perry admitted that the Facebook account belonged to him but insisted he was merely trying to warn fellow Americans to be wary of the “tyrannical” government prosecutors said.Perry also allegedly told investigators he believed they were violating his First Amendment right to free speech and that he intended to refuse to come to court after being released from jail on bond.“Americans are entitled to voice their opinions — but we will not allow them to threaten our officials’ physical safety” US Attorney Erin Nealy Cox said in a statement. “This defendant’s threats against the Speaker and law enforcement agents are wholly inexcusable and we look forward to bringing him to justice.”
481,Trump says GOP should eject Rep. Thomas Massie for stalling coronavirus bill,Steven Nelson,The New York Post,2,https://nypost.com/2020/03/27/trump-says-gop-should-eject-rep-thomas-massie-for-stalling-coronavirus-bill/,President Trump tore into Rep. Thomas Massie ahead of his possible action to stall a $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus bill saying Massie should be ejected from the Republican Party.Massie a libertarian from Kentucky has not said if he will stall the package by forcing a roll call vote but raised strong objections this week on Twitter saying it was “not a good deal.”Trump’s mounting fury boiled over in a pair of tweets as the House prepared to vote before noon on the stimulus bundle which was approved unanimously by the Senate on Wednesday.“Looks like a third rate Grandstander named @RepThomasMassie a Congressman from unfortunately a truly GREAT State Kentucky wants to vote against the new Save Our Workers Bill in Congress” Trump wrote on Twitter.Trump continued: “He just wants the publicity. He can’t stop it only delay which is both dangerous & costly. Workers & small businesses need money now in order to survive. Virus wasn’t their fault. It is ‘HELL’ dealing with the Dems had to give up some stupid things in order to get the ‘big picture’ done. 90% GREAT! WIN BACK HOUSE but throw Massie out of Republican Party!”Massie was glued to his cellphone after the Trump tweet. The 49-year-old MIT-educated engineer in office since 2012 looked around at the three dozen or so colleagues also sitting on the House floor many there in case he forces a roll call vote.Massie’s office has not responded to requests for comment from The Post. He did not respond to a text message asking if he had decided what he will do.The massive stimulus bill would be the third to pass Congress. A second package was stalled by Rep. Louis Gohmert (R-Texas) who also sat on the House floor Friday morning.It’s possible Gohmert may also object forcing the House to scramble for a roll call possibly delaying a vote until this weekend if 50 percent of lawmakers aren’t present.Shortly after the Trump tweet Massie and Gohmert sitting about 10 feet apart on the House floor leaned toward one another and engaged in a quiet conversation with Massie gesticulating with his hands and rolling his eyes.In a statement to The Post this week Gohmert said: “I would like to see all those who can and are healthy to come back review the bill allow amendments and vote on the amendments and the bill. That is what I would LIKE to see happen.”Gohmert continued: “The bill the Senate is preparing has had very significant viewing discussing and rewording as it should when there is time to have groups of elected officials reviewing language and considering its effects. If we have that opportunity then it actually might be possible to U.C. a bill of this magnitude. However the rather massive bill Speaker Pelosi is pushing has not been widely distributed fiercely debated or amended repeatedly with the actual effects fully contemplated. Therefore it would need to be prevented from being voice voted or passed by Unanimous Consent.”In a tweet Thursday Massie outlined his objections to the bill writing that the measure with $4 trillion in Federal Reserve stimulus would create $17000 per citizen in “new national debt and dollar devaluation.”Trump complained in a Thursday interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News that dealing with Democrats was “hell” citing their push to include various policy provisions in the bill. On Monday an apparent deal on the package fell apart despite concessions to Democrats. Republicans said Democrats introduced an unrelated wishlist of priorities scuttling speedy passage and forcing more negotiation.The aid package creates a $500 billion loan program run by the Treasury Department to assist businesses struggling to stay afloat. A separate $350 billion loan program in the bill allows small businesses to receive forgivable loans if they don’t lay off workers.A generous boost of $600 per week in unemployment pay actually could result in jobless workers getting more than 100 percent of their pay in some states. The package also authorizes $1200 checks for all adults who earn up to $75000 with $500 more per child. For a family of four that’s up to $3400.
482,CDC underestimated threat from coronavirus botched response: report,Yaron Steinbuch,The New York Post,2,https://nypost.com/2020/03/27/cdc-underestimated-threat-from-coronavirus-botched-response-report/,The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention underestimated the threat from the emerging outbreak of the coronavirus in the US — and bungled its communication with local public health agencies about what actions to take according to a report.ProPublica obtained hundreds of pages of documents that it said painted a picture of chaos at the country’s leading national public health agency that slowed the early response to the deadly illness.On Feb. 13 the CDC sent out an email with what the writer described as an “URGENT” appeal for assistance as the agency was struggling to keep track of people suspected of being infected the nonprofit news outlet reported.“Help needed urgently” the missive said amid “an ongoing issue” with organizing — and at times even misplacing — material sent by local agencies about Americans believed to be infected.In a bid to correct the botched efforts the CDC listed job postings for candidates who could track down the missing paperwork according to ProPublica which obtained the trove of documents between federal and state officials through a records request in Nevada.By the time the jobs posting went out there were already 15 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the US — two weeks before the first case of community transmission was reported in California.In a sign of the CDC’s state of confusion ProPublica cited documents that show the agency informed Nevada about 80 possible coronavirus patients to monitor — though four of them lived in New York not Nevada.When a state epidemiologist informed the CDC about the blunder it redirected the errant reports to the Empire State according to the documents.In another instance a Nevada health official asked the CDC about congressional funding to fight the disease.“There seems to be a communications blackout on this end” wrote the program manager who wondered how the money would be allocated.A CDC staffer apologized for the lack of information.“Unfortunately there is no clear answer to your questions” the staffer wrote. “We are hearing all of the rumor mills as well.”“Thank you” the Nevada official replied. “It’s good to be confused together.”During February the CDC also imposed a strict limit on who should be tested for the illness — a strategy that epidemiologists have assailed as limiting the ability to track its spread.The CDC told state officials Feb. 19 that those to be tested had to have had close contact with someone confirmed to be infected or to have traveled from China and then had simultaneous respiratory symptoms and a fever.But in January the agency had informed the states that “fever may not be present in some patients” according to a document obtained by ProPublica.In a statement to the news site the CDC said health professionals could always use their judgment to decide who should be tested.“CDC never declined a request for testing that came from a state or local health department” the agency said.The CDC also instructed states to use the web platform DCIPHER to report potential and confirmed cases — but it wasn’t until the following week that it scheduled training on how to use the platform documents show.ProPublica also described the CDC’s bumpy efforts to screen passengers arriving from China at the Los Angeles International Airport using a buggy questionnaire.Among the glitches was a drop-down menu that auto-populated with “United Kingdom” instead of “United States” forcing travelers to type “United States of America.”On Feb. 29 a CDC officer at the LA airport also sent an email to her colleagues saying: “In case this comes up again we are not screening private flights. These would be flights that land at LAX but don’t arrive into the regular terminal … mainly for rich people.”But she changed her tune a couple of hours later writing: “And maybe just kidding.”Enlarge ImageDr. Anthony Fauci speaks with Robert RedfieldDr. Anthony Fauci speaks with Robert Redfield.ReutersThe CDC told ProPublica that it focused on vetting the largest segment possible of high-risk fliers arriving from places like the Chinese epicenter city of Wuhan.The CDC chief Dr. Robert Redfield also sounded confident in his communications with others in the agency ProPublica reported.In a message he sent on Jan. 28 when the CDC had confirmed five cases of the coronavirus he acknowledged the pathogen posed “a very serious public health threat.”But he assured them “the virus is not spreading in the U.S. at this time” though that may not have been true according to the report.Trevor Bedford an epidemiologist in Seattle has said he believed the virus could have begun circulating in Washington state immediately after a traveler arrived in mid-January.The CDC told ProPublica that Redfield’s comments were based on the data available at the time.“At no time did he underestimate the potential for COVID-19 becoming a global pandemic” the agency said. “He stated consistently that more cases including person to person spread were likely.”The CDC did not respond to a request for comment by The Post.
483,House approves $2.2 trillion coronavirus aid package rushes bill to Trump,Steven Nelson,The New York Post,2,https://nypost.com/2020/03/27/house-approves-2-2-trillion-coronavirus-aid-package-rushes-bill-to-trump/,The House rushed President Donald Trump a $2.2 trillion rescue package Friday tossing a life preserver to a U.S. economy and health care system left flailing by the coronavirus pandemic.Members of the House of Representatives shouted down Rep. Thomas Massie as they passed the coronavirus stimulus bill — with one lawmaker bellowing “f–k you!” at the Kentucky Republican.Massie forced hundreds of lawmakers to return to the House chamber for the vote after indicating he would raise a point of order that fewer than 50 percent of lawmakers were present as required.But when the libertarian engineer stood to protest that the chamber was not full a furious colleague shouted “look around!”Surrounding Massie were hundreds of Republicans and Democrats who packed into the chamber and also the public viewing gallery one floor above to maintain enough distance to avoid spread of COVID-19.“Fuck you!” a man sitting on the Democratic side of the aisle shouted at Massie prompting heads to snap toward the voice responsible for the rare lack of decorum. The speaker was not immediately known.Massie explained on Twitter just before noon that the Constitution requires a quorum and that he opposes the bill on substance too.“This stimulus should go straight to the people rather than being funneled through banks and corporations like this bill is doing” Massie wrote. “2 trillion divided by 150 million workers is about $13333.00 per person. That’s much more than the $1200 per person check authorized by this bill.”President Trump fumed against Massie on Friday morning calling him a “third rate Grandstander” and adding: “throw Massie out of Republican Party!”
484,Trump Signs $2.2T Stimulus after Swift Congressional Votes,March 27 2020 | 9:52am | Updated,Newsmax,2,https://www.newsmax.com/us/virus-outbreak-congress/2020/03/27/id/960283/,"President Donald Trump signed an unprecedented $2.2 trillion economic rescue package into law Friday after swift and near-unanimous action by Congress this week to support businesses rush resources to overburdened health care providers and help struggling families during the deepening coronavirus epidemic.Acting with unity and resolve unseen since the 9/11 attacks Washington moved urgently to stem an economic free fall caused by widespread restrictions meant to slow the spread of the virus that have shuttered schools closed businesses and brought American life in many places to a virtual standstill.“This will deliver urgently needed relief"" Trump said as he signed the bill in the Oval Office flanked only by Republican lawmakers. He thanked members of both parties for putting Americans “first.”Earlier Friday the House of Representatives gave near-unanimous approval by voice vote after an impassioned session conducted along the social distancing guidelines imposed by the crisis. Many lawmakers sped to Washington to participate — their numbers swollen after a maverick Republican signaled he'd try to force a roll call vote — though dozens of others remained safely in their home districts.The Senate passed the bill unanimously late Wednesday.“The American people deserve a government-wide visionary evidence-based response to address these threats to their lives and their livelihood and they need it now” said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi D-Calif.The $2.2 trillion legislation will speed government payments of $1200 to most Americans and increase jobless benefits for millions of people thrown out of work. Businesses big and small will get loans grants and tax breaks. It will send unprecedented billions to states and local governments and the nation's all but overwhelmed health care system.“This pathogen does not recognize party lines and no partisan solution will defeat it. Neither will the government acting alone” said GOP Whip Liz Cheney of Wyoming. “This is not a time for cynicism or invective or second-guessing. This is a time to remember that we are citizens of the greatest nation on Earth that we have overcome every challenge we have faced and we will overcome this one.”Despite reservations arch conservatives joined with progressives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez D-N.Y. to back the bill which moved quickly through a Congress that’s been battered by partisanship and is itself not immune to the suffering the virus has caused. Rep. Joe Cunningham D-S.C. announced Friday that he has tested positive just the latest infection in Congress.Tea party Republicans said government orders to shutter businesses merited actions that conflict with small-government ideology. Liberals accepted generous corporate rescues that accompany larger unemployment benefits deferrals of student loans and an enormous surge of funding for health care and other agencies responding to the crisis.“I’m going to have to vote for something that has things in it that break my heart” said conservative Rep. David Schweikert R-Ariz.Many lawmakers summoned the bipartisan spirit of 9/11 and efforts to fight terrorism. Others praised the roles low-income workers play in keeping the country going and the heroism of health care workers. Some like Iowa Democrat Abby Finkenauer who had just learned of two additional coronavirus-related deaths in her district came close to tears.Others couldn’t restrain their partisan impulses. Republicans chided Democratic leaders for delays and provisions they see as extraneous such as funding for public broadcasting and the arts; Democrats said too many elements are a bailout for corporations that may not need it.Still in a chamber increasingly dominated by lawmakers whose chief skill often seems to be partisan attacks Friday’s debate was a noteworthy break.“We have no time to dither"" said Rep. Gerald Connolly D-Va. ""We have no time to engage in ideological or petty partisan fights. Our country needs us as one.”The run-up to the vote contained an element of drama because libertarian conservative Thomas Massie R-Ky. announced plans to seek a vote. The leaders of both parties united to prevent that because it would have forced lawmakers back to the Capitol or blemished their voting records if they stayed home. Instead they made sure enough lawmakers would attend Friday's session to block Massie's move under the rules and lawmakers took the unprecedented step of sitting in the visitors galleries to establish the necessary quorum.The House promptly adjourned for a weeks-long recess but will return later in the spring to consider further legislation.“This bill is not only a rescue package it’s a commitment — a commitment that your government and the people whom you elected to serve you will do everything we can to limit the harm and hardship you face both now and in the foreseeable future” said Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.The legislation will give $1200 direct payments to individuals and make way for a flood of subsidized loans grants and tax breaks to businesses facing extinction in an economic shutdown caused as Americans self-isolate by the tens of millions. It dwarfs prior Washington responses to crises like 9/11 the 2008 financial crisis and natural disasters.The massive CARES Act started as a draft plan among Republicans controlling the Senate who were seeking a greater voice in the coronavirus response efforts -- especially after Pelosi was a dominant force in earlier legislation imposing a sick leave mandate on businesses.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R-Ky. welcomed Democratic participation a week ago and signed off on a major expansion of unemployment insurance but his efforts to freeze out Pelosi and force a quick agreement were met with Democratic demands for large infusions of aid to states and hospitals as well as an assortment of smaller items. McConnell and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York wrestled for days along with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and other administration officials.Negotiations finally produced a deal early Wednesday morning and the Senate passed the measure by a 96-0 vote.Key elements are untested such as grants to small businesses to keep workers on payroll and complex lending programs to larger businesses. Rebate payments will go to people who have retained their jobs. Agencies like the Small Business Administration and state unemployment systems will be severely taxed and conservatives fear that a new generous unemployment benefit will dissuade jobless people from returning to the workforce.The bill amounts to a bridge loan for much of the economy and carries a price tag that equals half the size of the entire $4 trillion-plus annual federal budget.The legislation also establishes a $454 billion program for guaranteed subsidized loans to larger industries in hopes of leveraging up to $4.5 trillion in lending to distressed businesses states and municipalities.There is also $150 billion devoted to the health care system including $100 billion for grants to hospitals and other health care providers buckling under the strain of COVID-19 caseloads.It also seeks to strengthen the safety net for the poor and homeless. Schools and students would get relief small business loans payments would be deferred. Evictions from public housing would be put on pause.Republicans successfully pressed for an employee retention tax credit designed to help companies keep workers on payroll. Companies would also be able to defer payment of the 6.2% Social Security payroll tax. A huge tax break for interest costs and operating losses limited by the 2017 tax overhaul was restored at a $200 billion cost in a boon for the real estate sector.Most people who contract the new coronavirus have mild or moderate symptoms such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some especially older adults and people with existing health problems it can cause more severe illness including pneumonia or death.© Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

486,Blackburn Cotton Lead Senate Resolution on China COVID-19,Sandy Fitzgerald,Newsmax,2,https://www.newsmax.com/politics/blackburn-cotton-resolution/2020/03/27/id/960265/,"Sen. Marsha Blackburn and Tom Cotton are leading efforts for a Senate resolution that condemns the Chinese government for not taking responsibility or being transparent about the dangers of COVID-19 when the worldwide pandemic first began. “Chinese officials destroyed early COVID-19 test kits suppressed information and refused international assistance” Blackburn R-Tenn. said in a press release about the legislation. “The Communist Party is so petrified of the truth that they kicked out journalists and fabricated a story of where the virus originated. It’s time the Communist Party admits to the serious missteps that heightened the severity and spread of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.”""The Chinese Communist Party wasted precious weeks on a cynical cover-up instead of containing the China virus at its epicenter” said Cotton R-Ark. “Our first priority after protecting Americans must be holding China accountable for unleashing this plague on the world.”Their resolution is a companion measure to one introduced in the House by Rep. Jim Banks R-Ind. and Seth Moulton D-Mass.“As the Chinese Communist Party pushes propaganda and lies to try and blame the United States for coronavirus we need to make the case to the world that China is ultimately responsible for this outbreak"" Banks said. ""I hope this begins a conversation about how China can be held accountable for their negligent coronavirus response.""The proposed Senate resolution calls on China's government to publicly state there is no evidence COVID-19 started anywhere else; to denounce a conspiracy theory that the U.S. military put the virus in Wuhan; to revoke the expulsion of American journalists; end the detainment of Uyghur Muslims and other minorities and to end all forced labor programs among other matters."
487,Trump Promises GOP Convention Will Be Held This August,,Newsmax,2,https://www.newsmax.com/politics/trump-convention-virus/2020/03/27/id/960263/,President Donald Trump said that the Republican National Convention would go forward as planned this August even as the coronavirus has caused the cancellation of large-scale events all across the U.S.The Democrats are scheduled to hold their convention in Milwaukee from July 13 to 16. The Republican convention is to be held from Aug. 24 to 27 and the president told Sean Hannity on Fox News Thursday night that “We’re quite a bit later than them which I think is good.”He added that by the end of August “we’re going to be in a great space” though he did not specify why he thought that. He said that he might have a rally in Milwaukee. His campaign has not held any rallies because of the virus.The Democratic National Committee has been looking at contingency options for its party gathering amid a growing concern that the coronavirus crisis will not have abated by then.“As we navigate the unprecedented challenge of responding to the coronavirus we’re exploring a range of contingency options to ensure we can deliver a successful convention without unnecessary risk to public health” Katie Peters communications director for the DNC’s convention committee said in a statement earlier this week.Peters added it is a “very fluid situation” with the Democratic convention more than three months away.A convention is the only mechanism the parties have to nominate a presidential pick. If the pandemic persists they would have to change the rules in order to hold a different type of forum.

494,Workers Are Warriors in the Fight Against the Coronavirus,Jeet Heer,The Nation,-2,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/workers-warriors-coronavirus/,During a briefing on March 19 Donald Trump likened the fight against the coronavirus pandemic to a military conflict. “It’s a war” Trump said. He went on to describe himself as a “wartime president.” The analogy is a familiar one. Both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders also talk about the current crisis as the equivalent of war.The metaphor is worth pursuing. If we are at war with the coronavirus then the front-line soldiers are the workers who are putting their lives on the line by providing essential services. First and foremost are hospital staff led by doctors and nurses but including everyone needed to keep the full infrastructure of the medical system functioning.Beyond hospitals even communities under lockdown require an army of workers: the staff of grocery stores and pharmacies the staff needed to keep supply chains functioning (warehouse workers truckers delivery people) sanitation workers and innumerable other blue-color positions. As my colleague John Nichols notes “The battle to get ahead of the coronavirus curve is so serious and so demanding that the list of working-class heroes grows with each passing day.”The war on the coronavirus is already taking casualties. The New York Post reports that staff at Mount Sinai West were blaming the coronavirus death of assistant mursing manager Kious Kelly age 48 on the poor equipment at the hospital. Photos have circulated on social media of nurses at the hospital using black plastic bags as homemade protective gear. “Kious didn’t deserve this” a nurse told the newspaper. “The hospital should be held responsible. The hospital killed him.”According to The New York Times “Early research shows that health care workers are more likely to contract the coronavirus than the average person and when they get it to suffer more severe symptoms. Many doctors are already rationing the protective gowns gloves and masks that are necessary to keep them safe.”As a result many doctors are taking extraordinary measures like drawing up wills and naming those who should take care of their children in the event of death. “There are a good number of people who are going to die here” Dr. John Marshall the chairman of emergency medicine at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn told the newspaper. He added “Health care workers will be part of that number.”It’s not just doctors and nurses who are putting their lives at risk. There have been a string of cases of Amazon warehouse workers contracting Covid-19. This issue is causing strains in the company because these workers don’t get paid sick leave. They can take unpaid days off and keep their job. This is a policy that obviously endangers workers by creating an incentive for those who are possibly sick to stay at work.Amazon tech workers who are encouraged to work from home circulated a letter on Wednesday complaining about the policy. “Even as office workers are asked to work from home Amazon’s measures to protect FC [fulfillment center] and DC [data center] workers as well as shop floor workers at Whole Foods have ranged from inadequate to openly negligent” the letter noted.The rising tide of protests reinforces the idea that we are in a war. While patriotic mythology portrays the sacrifice of soldiers as purely idealistic the simple reality is that heroic suffering allows ordinary people to make greater demands on society.The sacrifice of African American soldiers in the Civil War strengthened the case for abolition a pattern that recurred in subsequent wars when black veterans often cited their service when fighting for civil rights.The American welfare state was shaped by widely shared sentiments about the debt society owes to soldiers evident in the pioneering pensions given to Union soldiers of the Civil War the GI Bill after World War II and the health care provided by the Veterans Administration.During the First World War British Prime Minister Lloyd George promised “a habitation fit for heroes” (which the press shortened to “a home fit for heroes”). He was referring to providing housing for returning soldiers but “a home fit for heroes” has wider resonance. It’s a demand for social change to justify the sacrifices of war.In the current fight against the pandemic the fault lines of class conflict are already evident. Conservatives are very well aware that the working class is in a position to make larger demands.A counterrevolution against these demands is already coalescing. Four Republican senators tried to resist the provisions in the coronavirus bill that expanded unemployment insurance.Amazingly South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham even made the argument that some nurses would take the opportunity to avoid work saying “If you are a nurse’s aide making $15 or $16 an hour you are on the front lines here. A lot of doctors’ offices are going to have to roll back because elective surgery is not a source of income for a bunch of doctors. So you are going to have all these well-trained nurses they are going to make $24 an hour on unemployment. You are literally incentivizing taking people out of the workforce at a time when we need critical infrastructure supplied with workers.” Graham didn’t consider the possibility of paying more money to nurses who even he admits are essential.The impulse to thwart the empowerment of workers can be seen not just in Graham’s words but also in the larger structure of the Senate bailout. While it did provide a one-time payment to ordinary Americans as well as a decent increase in unemployment insurance the bulk of the bailout followed the traditional pattern of providing easy money to large corporations while not binding them in any meaningful way. The impact of this bailout then was to preserve the social status quo with the existing bosses still having domination over the economy.The open question is how long this status quo can last. American workers are putting their lives on the line every day. An army can make heroic sacrifices but if it feels badly treated badly an army can also mutiny.
495,This Is What an Opposition Party Is Supposed to Sound Like,John Nichols,The Nation,-2,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/sanders-senate-coronavirus-relief/,Republicans are using the coronavirus outbreak as an excuse to do the same thing they did during the financial meltdown of 2008: wage class war against working Americans. This time Bernie Sanders is refusing to let them get away with it.Employing a combination of moral outrage and devastating sarcasm the Vermont senator shamed Republicans in a Wednesday Senate floor speech that ripped into them for prioritizing corporate bailouts while objecting to providing a measure of security for low-wage workers who have lost their jobs as much of the American economy has ground to a near halt.“How absurd and wrong is that? What kind of value system is that?” demanded Sanders as he railed against a Republican amendment that would have constrained benefits at a time when the unemployment rate is skyrocketing. Even in the midst of the crisis the senator thundered “Some of my Republican friends have still not given up on the need to punish the poor and working people.”In a matter of minutes during a debate that focused on just one portion of a huge measure Sanders illustrated how an opposition party is supposed to operate and what it’s supposed to sound like. Refusing to let Republicans peddle the nonsense that invariably serves as a cover for the awful combination of bailouts for the wealthy and austerity for the working class Sanders pushed back.It was a fight Sanders expected to win but it was the way he fought it that mattered: He hit as hard as the Republicans. And he claimed the moral high ground—inspiring the hashtag #ThankYouBernie to trend on social media as the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II wrote “#ThankYouBernie for pointing out the immorality of Republicans funding big business & trying to strip out the few things in the bill to help poor & low income workers.”Former senator Heidi Heitkamp a moderate Democrat from North Dakota circulated a video of the speech with the message “I may not always agree with @BernieSanders but this is @BernieSanders at his very best. You go my friend!”Whether Sanders continues his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination as he trails former vice president Joe Biden or whether he folds at some point his speech this week signaled that the senator will remain a transformative figure in the politics of the Democratic Party and the United States.The fight that Sanders joined goes to the heart of concerns about the federal response to economic dislocation caused by the coronavirus pandemic. There is broad bipartisan agreement that Congress must move decisively to fund an urgent response. But there is a good deal of disagreement about how to respond to the economic fallout as states lock down in order to slow the spread of the deadly virus. There is a good deal of concern that the legislative process will be gamed by Republicans—and perhaps some Democrats—who are as inclined to bail out Wall Street in 2020 as they were in 2008. The wrangling over the Senate bill highlighted those concerns.The $2 trillion relief package that the Senate approved Wednesday night does everything imaginable and a few things that are unimaginable for big business. The 880-page measure allocates $425 billion to create a fund controlled by the Federal Reserve which permits massive loans to corporations. In addition it makes $75 billion available for loans targeted to aid the airline and hotel industries.The legislation is so friendly to big business that even after it was reported on Thursday morning that a record 3.28 million people had filed for unemployment benefits the Dow Jones surged because as one analyst told CNBC “the focus by the market now is on the fact we’re likely to get a historically large fiscal stimulus.” The wolves of Wall Street are excited by what economist Dean Baker correctly identifies as “the $500 billion slush fund that McConnell has made a centerpiece of the Senate bill.”The measure would have been dramatically worse had Republicans not been faced with the reality of a divided Congress and the interventions of Senate minority leader Charles Schumer and his caucus which fought for more than $100 billion for hospitals $150 billion dollars for state and local government $30 billion in emergency education funding $25 billion in emergency transit funding vital initiatives for small businesses and anti-corruption initiatives that Schumer said were toughened with the aid of Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. The Democrats celebrated a plan providing direct payments averaging $1200 for individuals and $2400 for couples as well as what Schumer dubbed “unemployment insurance on steroids.”The package as it was agreed to by Senate negotiators featured a section—which Sanders and other progressives had championed—that supercharged unemployment benefits by promising out-of-work Americans up to four months of weekly unemployment checks from the states where they live and an additional $600 a week in benefits. It also established a new Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program to provide benefits to gig workers and the self-employed.This level of care for vulnerable workers disturbed Republican Senators Tim Scott Lindsey Graham and Ben Sasse. Their objection? “Unless this bill is fixed there is a strong incentive for employees to be laid off instead of going to work. This isn’t an abstract philosophical point—it’s an immediate real-world problem” the senators claimed in a press statement continuing:If the federal government accidentally incentivizes layoffs we risk life-threatening shortages in sectors where doctors nurses and pharmacists are trying to care for the sick and where growers and grocers truckers and cooks are trying to get food to families’ tables. This isn’t who we are as Americans; this isn’t what we do in a crisis. We must sadly oppose the fast-tracking of this bill until this text is addressed or the Department of Labor issues regulatory guidance that no American would earn more by not working than by working.Sanders responded immediately:Unless these Republican Senators drop their objections I am prepared to put a hold on this bill until stronger conditions are imposed on the $500 billion corporate welfare fund to make sure that any corporation receiving financial assistance under this legislation does not lay off workers cut wages or benefits ship jobs overseas or pay workers poverty wages.When the Republican amendment was debated Wednesday Sanders held nothing back.“So now I find that some of my Republican colleagues are very distressed. They’re very upset that somebody who is making $10 $12 an hour might end up with a paycheck for four months [amounting to] more than they received last week” raged the senator. Aiming sarcastic fury at the Republicans he shouted:Oh my God the universe is collapsing. Imagine that! Somebody is making 12 bucks an hour now like the rest of us faces an unprecedented economic crisis with the 600 bucks on top of their normal regular unemployment check might be making a few bucks more for four months. Oh my word will the universe survive?Noting that “these very same folks had no problem a couple years ago voting for a trillion dollars in tax breaks for billionaires and large profitable corporations” Sanders added “But when it comes to low-income workers in the midst of a terrible crisis maybe some of them earning or having more money than they previously made—oh my word we gotta strip that out.”The Senate did not strip it out. The Republican amendment failed and the objecting senators folded—joining the full Senate in voting for the overall bill.What was striking and what will be remembered is that in this chaotic moment Bernie Sanders framed an urgent debate around the fundamental premise that “one thing we must not do is punish low-income workers.”
496,The Postal Service Is Breaking Down,Jake Bittle,The Nation,-2,https://www.thenation.com/article/society/post-office-coronavirus/,Last Thursday Charles Martin showed up at the post office in Cincinnati Ohio where he works as a letter carrier. When he arrived he learned that a clerk in the station had been quarantined after she displayed symptoms of Covid-19.“I heard about it from somebody else in the station because management hasn’t announced it yet” Martin told me. “Half the station still doesn’t know.” He keeps going into work though he said; after all the number of packages has started to ramp up since Ohio’s governor closed bars and restaurants on March 15.“We’re an essential service so we’ve got to keep going” Martin said “but there are a lot of older employees at my station and I’m worried about it spreading to them.” The oldest carrier he said was more than 75 years old; as of Tuesday that carrier and all the others in Martin’s station were showing up though many of them are afraid to interact with their coworkers and their customers.As the coronavirus spreads throughout the United States the Postal Service has struggled to maintain its crucial role in connecting the country while also protecting its workers and customers. These challenges are not limited to disinfecting surfaces or social distancing either: Many post offices have long been understaffed and the coronavirus is poised to push an already overworked labor force to a breaking point. Without drastic action the virus could soon threaten the Postal Service just when it’s needed most.On Thursday the National Association of Letter Carriers reported that Rakkhon Kim a 50-year-old mail carrier in the Bronx had died of complications related to Covid-19. As of that same day at least 85 postal workers were suspected to have the coronavirus about quadruple the number that were thought to have it last week. These employees work in stations all around the country from locked down areas like New York City and Westchester County to more remote towns like Howell Georgia and Troy Michigan.The Postal Service said it has quarantined those employees and anyone who had close contact with them for more than a few minutes but thousands upon thousands of carriers and clerks are still going to work where every day they deliver to hundreds of different addresses and handle thousands of pieces of paper and cardboard where research suggests the virus can linger for hours at a time.The rapid spread of the coronavirus caught many industries in the United States by surprise but postal workers said the response at their stations has been particularly slow and ineffective. Half a dozen clerks and carriers told me that management has not been able to provide soap disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer or gloves for postal carriers.Last week USPS management rolled out new protocols that require employees to wear gloves and guarantee masks to any employee who wants one. They also mandate that all surfaces be disinfected and wiped down. But postal workers uniformly told me they can’t access any protective and sanitary supplies; two employees further said that as of Monday their station management still hadn’t addressed the coronavirus in stand-up meetings.“I’d describe their response as completely lacking” said Lawrence a carrier who works in western Ohio. “[Last] Friday was the first day it got brought up in any meaningful way and that was to tell us they had no supplies to help us with cleaning with gloves anything” he said. “Otherwise it’s been treated as nothing is going on.”A postal clerk named Jim who works in Colorado said that even though there haven’t been many coronavirus cases in his area yet he’s worried about spreading the disease while on his route.“Right now the focus is on washing your hands and disinfecting but it’s viable for a very long time on cardboard and we don’t have very many disinfecting supplies” he said. “If you have a post office like ours with a small lobby you can see how the mail coming in could easily spread the disease.” While FedEx and UPS have new guidelines that prohibit customers from touching digital package scanners Jim said his station was still allowing customers to sign for packages and certified mail.At his station he said a lobby assistant typically walks down the line and uses a mobile scanner to scan packages allowing customers to sign the scanner with their fingers. Colorado instituted a shelter-in-place order on Tuesday but before that he said his station management hadn’t taken the disease seriously.“I deliver to an area that has a good amount of elderly people in it and they’re the ones who are most likely to meet me at the door to say hello or to get their mail right away. It makes me uneasy because they’re very vulnerable” Lawrence said.“Even when people want to take normal sick leave it’s always a struggle at our station” said Jim. “It requires overtime extended hours things like that.” If the coronavirus spreads through the workforce in his area of Colorado he said the workforce will be stretched even further—likely with clerks and carriers forced to work daily shifts of up to 12 hours.“The last couple days it’s almost like Christmas again with the parcel volume” said Lawrence. “We’re starting to get shipments of things that people can’t get in stores anymore.” People in his station he said were working minimum 10-hour shifts already even with no one out on sick leave. An increase in package volume of course means more heavy lifting for clerks and carriers which will leave them more exhausted at the end of each day.Sasha who delivers mail in a city in Massachusetts said carriers in his station were already doubling up on routes before the virus.“My station is pretty understaffed as it is. Actually most of the stations around here are understaffed so we’re already kind of on a shoestring” he said adding that on most of his shifts he delivers for two full postal routes. “Anytime someone does call in sick that’s another route that isn’t getting delivered so we’re all doing a lot of overtime as it is. If we start having a lot of carriers out then honestly I don’t know what it’s going to look like.”David Partenheimer a spokesperson for the USPS told me “The safety of our employees remains our highest priority. We are urgently working to make sure all our employees have what they need to stay safe and healthy.” He added that the USPS had rolled out a series of informational videos and talks about hand washing and social distancing and that it was making masks and gloves available to employees who asked for them. He also said that the agency had modified customer signature procedures to avoid customers touching scanners and was encouraging carriers to keep a safe distance from customers.As the coronavirus taxes staffing levels the two postal unions and postal management are scrambling to find a way to keep workers safe without compromising the agency’s essential function. Last week the unions representing mail handlers and letter carriers both inked deals with postal management that will allow employees to use their sick leave days to take care of children who may be out of school a policy that includes part-time “non-career” employees. The agreements also require station managers to relax their typically strict policies about schedule and shift changes.Looking forward though the unions’ biggest concern is the same as the rank-and-file employees who spoke to me: making sure stations can get the mail out without overworking their clerks and carriers.“The staffing levels are definitely strained” said Kevin Tabarus who runs the New York City local for the National Postal Mail Handlers’ Union. “It’s becoming a problem. We’re encouraging our employees to stay home if they feel sick of course but the ones that are able to work are working even more hours to get the mail out. There are attendance problems because people are sick of course so everybody’s working overtime.”Don Sneedly who runs the NPMHU local in Washington state and Alaska said that there have been work shortages across his region as well. Sneedly said that if things get much worse in Seattle the USPS may have to treat the coronavirus as it would a natural disaster temporarily suspending operations in the facilities or areas that have been heaviest hit by the disease.Paul Hogrogian the president of the mail-handlers’ union said that he expects management and the unions will soon come to an agreement that would temporarily allow the Postal Service to hire what it calls “non-career” employees which are part-time employees without benefits. This potential agreement which has not been previously reported would help improve conditions at many understaffed stations and provide thousands of new jobs for Americans who have been laid off or whose employers have folded due to the coronavirus. (The National Association of Letter Carriers the other major postal union said only that the union was in “an ongoing dialogue with the Postal Service” about the coronavirus.)In a statement released on Monday night Representatives Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) and Gerry Conolly (D-VA) said that the Postal Service had already seen a sharp decline in traditional mail like magazines and fliers; without direct financial assistance they said the agency could go broke by the summer.The Postal Service would likely turn a profit if it were run like most government agencies but the agency is bound by a unique requirement to pre-fund its retirement benefits more than 50 years in advance. That mandate along with a post-recession decline in mail volumes has left the agency in a precarious financial situation and the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus now puts its basic operations in jeopardy. Accordingly the two representatives added to the House stimulus package a set of provisions that would help bail out the agency including an emergency payment of $25 billion and a provision that would allow the agency to borrow an additional $15 billion in the short term. The final version of the bill passed by the Senate though only raised the borrowing limit to $10 billion and omitted the emergency payment.If Congress does not take further action to save the Postal Service in the near future the scenario predicted by Maloney and Connolly may come to pass and its consequences would be dire. Without a functioning Postal Service there would be no one to deliver medicine medical supplies and protective equipment to households and hospitals around the country especially in more remote places. As more states and cities go on lockdown families will also rely on the USPS to deliver packages full of any food and hygienic supplies they may not be able to find in grocery stores. And now that Congress has passed its $2 trillion stimulus package it will be USPS workers who will deliver the checks that many Americans desperately need.“We’re really on the frontlines” said Tabarus. “We’ve never seen something like this before. Anthrax was bad for instance but this really beats it. It’s really really bad.”But the postal workers who spoke to me said that the Postal Service’s role in fighting the coronavirus goes beyond what’s sorted in its distribution plants and packed into its mail trucks. The agency’s most important role during a pandemic the postal employees said is as a first responder an infrastructure that helps keep people connected to each other when nothing else will.“We deliver medicine and essential equipment yes” said Jim “but we’re also the ones who are going to every address often conduct welfare checks on people knocking on the door and saying ‘Hey are you OK?’ That’s our traditional role it goes back for a while.”Sasha agreed saying his customers have told him over the past few weeks that seeing his truck outside their window helps give them a sense of normalcy. “Our routes are timed to the minute” he said. “We hit the same house at the same time every day. There are some customers who look forward to that. That might be their only human contact the entire day. It lets them breathe a little bit easier like all right things are bad but we still have some sense of stability going on.”“We’re a service that stitches the community together” said Martin. “If people see us out delivering the mail like normal it calms them down.”
497,To Stop Anti-Trans Legislation Abolish the Settler State,Taliah Mancini,The Nation,-2,https://www.thenation.com/article/activism/candi-brings-plenty-interview/,Covid-19 is providing cover for other forms of violence. While mutual aid projects (and calls for housing and health care for all) spring up across the country conservatives in state legislatures remain fixated on regulating trans bodies. Last week the Idaho Senate passed one bill banning gender changes on birth certificates and another prohibiting trans girls from competing in women’s sports; a third bill that would have made it a felony to provide gender-affirming care to trans youth died in committee.Each of these measures can be traced back to South Dakota long a testing ground for anti-trans legislation. In 2016 the state introduced one of the first “bathroom bills” which while vetoed paved the way for a chain of legislation seeking to prevent trans people from using the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity. Soon after South Dakota Republicans began targeting trans high school athletes. (This “sports bill” also failed but has been followed by nearly identical measures in more than 15 other states.) At the beginning of this year House Bill 1057 sought to criminalize medical care for trans youth. (In almost a dozen additional states including Idaho legislators have proposed similar laws.)But these bills according to indigenous activist Candi Brings Plenty are pieces of a larger puzzle: For centuries the gender binary has been tied up in white supremacy. The regulation of gender was even part of the genocidal conquest of the Americas. In 1513 Vasco Núñez de Balboa set his dogs on 40 Cueva Indians for “sodomy” believing them to be men assuming the roles of women. Beginning in the 1870s over 100 state-sponsored boarding schools sought to forcibly assimilate Native American communities which included eradicating “two-spirit” identities—a modern umbrella term coined in the early 1990s to refer to LGBTQ+ people across Turtle Island (First Nations folks from Canada indigenous people in Mexico and Alaska Natives and American Indians from the United States).For Candi Brings Plenty the indigenous justice organizer for South Dakota’s ACLU this reality is at the core of her work. Anti-trans movements she explained must be regarded as part of systems that seek to steal land and silence peoples and customs.Brings Plenty is a two-spirit Oglala Lakota Sioux who grew up in the Black Hills and on the Pine Ridge Reservation. I spoke with her by phone a few days after HB 1057 was effectively killed in the Senate. Our conversation has been edited for clarity and length.Taliah Mancini: I want to start by asking you about South Dakota’s recent bill that threatened medically necessary care like puberty blockers and hormones for trans youth. Why did you testify and what did the organizing against the bill look like?Candi Brings Plenty: I’m a lobbyist and indigenous justice organizer at the ACLU South Dakota which represents South Dakota North Dakota and Wyoming. The ACLU has a few campaigns going: one is indigenous justice—what my position was created for—and another is LGBTQ/two-spirit justice.We’re defining what indigenous justice looks like. Before we can have any social justice impact we have to be accountable for indigenous justice because that was the first injustice on Turtle Island. What gets left out is that colonization was the theft of our land—and that it also included eradicating the role of two-spirit people.TM: Before joining the ACLU you led efforts against the Keystone XL Pipeline and Dakota Access Pipeline including leading the two-spirit encampment at Standing Rock. You’ve also done work surrounding murdered and missing indigenous women. Can you expand on why indigenous justice work is interconnected with the fight for trans and feminist justice?CBP: I really believe that Standing Rock broke [the door] open for folks to feel safe and capable to use their voices and platforms without fear. I know that it empowered the act of compassion which is one of the biggest virtues in indigenous walks of life. Having the largest gathering of nations empowered us to have a humanitarian component in the work that we do. I knew that [the two-spirit camp] would be the biggest impact I could have as a two-spirit activist: to claim our space and to have an opportunity not only to be visible but to create a movement within the movement.TM: You have talked before about how there is a correct way to do this. What does it mean to follow traditional protocol when reclaiming sacred spaces?CBP: I have been raised by Lakota culture and spirituality. Regardless of age or gender or stature in the community—regardless of whether it is on the battlefield or social gatherings or traditional ceremonies—there are protocols that have to be honored. When we’re following protocol we are seen as people who are carrying the tradition of how to conduct appropriately and according to our ancestors. Growing up in my culture I knew and witnessed the folks who protected those protocols. They were able to speak when other people weren’t so I learned to honor and respect our ceremonies because that gave me the opportunity to speak. To follow protocol opens doors in places where they hadn’t been.TM: Understanding what it means to be two-spirit is central to understanding your fight. What has your process of coming into your politics looked like?CBP: Even just in the United States there are over 580 federally recognized tribes. So the term two-spirit was coined to encompass a cultural identifier for LGBTQ+ folks from Turtle Island who hold a cultural role within the walk of life. The term acknowledges that every tribe every indigenous culture has their own language and spiritual role—and that there is an honored space for two-spirit folks. And there always has been since before first contact.I am very much a product of my parents who were survivors of the boarding school era. I quickly learned about the boarding schools and heard the stories of how both my parents were abused by the Jesuits and the Catholic Church. I was raised to know that I had my own identity that I had my own culture and spirituality and language and my own connections to my ancestors; and I was raised to know that my parents were traumatized and survived what assimilation attempted to steal from them and me. I know that as we grow we grow in our activism. We continue to blossom to shed those layers of assimilation and colonization that our ancestors lived through.TM: How has this informed your thinking about the uses and limits of legal battles?CBP: From the moment that I was informed that I received this position my platform was and is to evolve the front lines. Being at Standing Rock for 11 months I was brutally beaten and received all the intentional psychological abuse that they were intending for water protectors and folks who were at Oceti Sakowin and Standing Rock. I endured that and it helped me have this perspective of what it means for water protectors to organize. I’ve always had a tribal political view of what that looked like because I was raised by my father who was on tribal council for over 20 years. My father always empowered me; he said “If you’re going to be a leader you put the people first. You’re only standing in the front so that you can hold the people up so that you can endure the hard part so the oyaté [the people] doesn’t have to.” I had a dislocated elbow I had hypothermia I had a cracked tooth; I still have this permanent egg-bump on my forehead from scar tissue. Whether it’s protecting protocol for ceremonies or empowering and bringing visibility to two-spirits it’s always about protecting the sacred so that our future generations don’t have to.TM: What do you tell two-spirit kids and advocates who are looking to build strong communities in the face of all this?CBP: I often talk about the tipi: one of the geometric structures that was gifted to us in a spiritual way. Each tipi pole represents a family member. I talk to youth I talk to adults and I tell them: You are the blessing in your family and every family has a two-spirit member or LGBTQ+ member whether it’s an uncle or auntie a relative or cousin a sibling or a parent. There is a place for each person in that family construct. If one of those tipi poles was missing that tipi would not be able to stand. In our culture in the northern plains the natural disaster is a tornado. The tipi was gifted to us because the wind goes through and up and out. The tipi doesn’t get knocked over; but if one of those poles is missing then the circle isn’t complete. I tell folks to hold on to their identity to honor themselves and to wholeheartedly empower the identity that they walk in. It is OK to be the rainbow buffalo of your herd.
498,The Crisis in Wuhan ‘Forced Me to Become Political’,Jessie Lau,The Nation,-2,https://www.thenation.com/article/world/wuhan-coronavirus-quarantine/,Chen Meili (not her real name) is a recent university graduate in her early 20s born and raised in Wuhan China. She had been living and working in another province for about a year when she returned to her hometown for Lunar New Year celebrations on January 19—just days before the city was placed under lockdown on January 23 to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. Since then she hasn’t stepped foot outside. No one in her immediate family got sick.As China has begun to report fewer new domestic coronavirus cases and the epicenter of the pandemic has shifted toward Europe and the United States the Chinese government is slowly easing its quarantine measures. Yesterday residents in Hubei Province outside of Wuhan the capital city became able to travel again for the first time in more than two months; Wuhan residents will be allowed to travel starting April 8. While Wuhan appears to have emerged from the darkest period of this crisis—with authorities reporting a near-zero community transmission rate—many distrust official figures and remain concerned about potentially asymptomatic residents.Speaking over Skype and social media Chen told The Nation how the virus has upended her community and her country and about the trauma it leaves behind. This interview has been edited and condensed from four conversations.When I returned home I had no idea my city was about to be shut down. I wanted to spend Chinese New Year with my family. We had a massive gathering planned. I remember reading some foreign news reports on the virus in early January but we weren’t too concerned. After all it wasn’t being reported in Chinese media so we assumed it was just fake news. Then the government announced the lockdown.In those early weeks I was in a constant state of anxiety. I would wake up in the morning and immediately check my phone for the latest updates: what developments there were whether my loved ones were safe how many were infected what policies were being put into place. The rules like the ban on private cars seemed simple at first. But when put into practice cracks appeared and things started to get chaotic. It became a pattern: a very broad and ambiguous policy would come out there would be problems and officials would adjust.But they were too slow. Stories about hospitals overwhelmed with patients and medical shortages began circulating. My phone was constantly buzzing. I found myself unable to tear my eyes away from heartbreaking messages about doctors and nurses running out of masks but still risking their lives on our behalf. On the streets there were social workers checking people’s temperatures but none of them had masks on despite coming into contact with dozens. The situation seemed out of control. Government measures seemed to always be one step behind the virus.Many of us agreed with the lockdown. None of us wanted to be infected and we didn’t want to spread the virus. So we sacrificed our freedom. In China everyone is on WeChat and Weibo so although we were all isolated we were connected through these social media platforms. We felt a powerful sense of responsibility toward one another. I was in a news group on WeChat when someone messaged me asking whether I was a volunteer. “No” I replied. “Do you want to be?” they asked. I wasn’t sure and they sent me a bunch of information about volunteering and asked me to think about it. It seemed overwhelming but I was in the group already so I started to observe what they were doing. That’s how I became a grassroots volunteer.There were all kinds of volunteers: those driving hospital staff to and from work those collecting pleas for help and editing them for resharing those running errands for vulnerable members of the population such as disabled or elderly people. Stuck at home I mainly used social media to connect people who needed resources to those who could provide them. Most of us were young people. Suddenly everyone was trying their best to help one another because we knew that we needed to. I felt proud of my community.One of my friends volunteered to fundraise and source supplies for a hospital. She found and bought materials and tried to have them shipped to China which meant going through customs and finding routes into Hubei Province. There weren’t efficient channels for doing this and it was super stressful. All we had was social media. The hard part was finding products that matched health standards and to not get cheated because there were many fraudsters trying to make a profit. There was also a risk that your supplies wouldn’t make it to the designated hospital in time or that they would be intercepted by officials. It was difficult and discouraging. But she succeeded in shipping masks to a hospital in Hubei with money to spare and returned the rest to the donors.As the lockdown intensified it became harder to get supplies. The quarantine became more restrictive and fewer people were able to leave their homes. There was not much we could do so we had to rely on and trust the government. When Li Wenliang died on February 7 our family was in shock. He was a doctor who had tried to warn people about the virus in December but was silenced by the government; eventually he was infected himself. We were depressed and felt so much anger. It was like we were paralyzed. That evening we had a small ceremony to commemorate him. We turned off the lights played some music and read an article about him aloud. My mother then ranted about local officials’ repressing the truth for 30 minutes straight. She couldn’t stop.This pandemic is like a mirror reflecting all the hidden problems in society. It made me aware of things that I had somehow never noticed before but now seem so obvious. I tried to search on Baidu China’s Google for statistics on how many medical workers had died. But I couldn’t find this information anywhere. There were lots of news stories about how many masks were being made or supplies being shipped but none describing the shortages we still faced or how many were becoming ill. I felt very frustrated. I understood that the government didn’t want to cause panic but I felt like we should be trusted to know the truth. I felt patronized being made to look at things through their filtered lens.The sad thing is now people don’t want to talk about how sad or angry they are. They feel like if they speak about it online their posts will be censored anyway. Or worse they may face the same fate as Li Wenliang. I’ve never seen censorship being exercised so quickly and frequently in my life. I would share an article and it would be deleted just hours later. This would happen four to five times in one month. I’d never experienced this before. In China there is also this culture of staying positive. This makes many people feel like they can’t express themselves and if they tried they would just be misunderstood. So we suppress our emotions. Now I don’t see many personal posts about the coronavirus because people are tired. If you’re angry for so long you just want a break.Recently I turned on China Central Television which I’d never really watched before. All I saw was positive news which made me depressed. Half was about leaders of other countries praising the Chinese Communist Party’s efforts in battling the virus half was about volunteers and other feel-good stories. I know they want to send hopeful messages to the public. But I couldn’t help but feel like they were just choosing not to recognize the deaths of countless people.When I heard about journalists disappearing in Wuhan I watched a few of their videos. I thought that Li Zehua—the CCTV reporter who quit his job to do his own reporting in Wuhan before going missing—was definitely biased against the CCP. But it’s unnecessary to make him disappear. And if there were more journalists out there doing what he was doing his videos wouldn’t be so eye-catching and we would have more objective news sources.My parent’s generation feel proud of our country and how the government handled the crisis. My father who had a tough upbringing is very pro–Communist Party. If I say anything critical about the government he would say: “Look what they’ve achieved! Unlike us you never had to starve.” Then he wouldn’t want to talk anymore. Things are a bit better with my mom but it’s frustrating because she’s become more nationalistic after this virus became a pandemic. We young people are very disgusted by this type of nationalism especially when we read blatantly nationalistic news stories. It’s like they’re trying to manipulate us by further distancing China from other countries and fostering fake pride.Before this I never used to talk about politics. I didn’t feel like I knew enough. But this crisis has forced me to become political. I see now that we have a system that dictates which views are “correct” and silences others. I’ve always disliked censorship in my country but now I’m realizing just how unhealthy it is. It’s very vulnerable to have a society that can’t handle different views. It makes it easier for people to be misled. As a Chinese person I see people from other countries also being prejudiced against us because they don’t trust us. The tension between China and other countries stems from censorship which is a double-edged sword. I don’t think I’m living in a healthy society or a healthy world.Now the situation in Wuhan is improving and I’m thankful. As the virus moves to other countries some of which are having trouble containing the spread many Chinese people feel lucky to be under the rule of a central government that was able to implement a lockdown so quickly and respond to the crisis with exceptional efficiency. I’m planning to stay in China at least until the end of the year. I don’t know where exactly since I’m really not sure whether there will be a second wave of the virus and where that might take place. I’m worried about the number of imported cases that are quickly increasing in several big cities and I’m also worried about discrimination against people from Hubei. If I tried to move I might be refused entry to some cities or be forced to quarantine at my own expense.This experience has made me reflect on how hard it is to be Chinese. Either I choose to be honest to speak the truth express my anger like a complete human being and face the consequences—or I choose to be the good citizen the government wants me to be and stay safe. It’s a very unfair situation. If we do speak out we’re also worried that our words will be twisted by Western media. I feel tired when I’m asked questions by foreigners that seem designed to fish out some hidden facts about how the CCP has deprived us of basic human rights in the lockdown or read reports that only focus on this angle and omit other parts of our story that I feel are equally important. The fear of our words’ becoming exaggerated by Western media and causing chaos makes us repress how we really feel.I think many people are like me: angry and refusing to give up on spreading the truth. I see a lot of friends still sharing sensitive articles before they’re deleted. Most of us also love our country and our people. We don’t directly point our fingers at the CCP; we’re sickened by propaganda and the problems caused by a bureaucratic system but we don’t deny the party’s contributions. They did lead us out of extreme poverty and a century of humiliation. None of us want to experience war and chaos again.I think the rise in Chinese nationalism and the rise in discrimination against Chinese people go hand-in-hand. As a young Chinese person who disagrees with these ways of thinking I think I will find it hard to live anywhere—either inside or outside of China—and steer clear of both.
499,The Coronavirus Is Trump’s Latest Excuse to Militarize the Border,Ken Klippenstein,The Nation,-2,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/border-coronavirus-military-immigration/,Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has requested the assistance of over 1500 US military personnel for border enforcement citing immigrants’ “potential to spread infectious disease” according to an internal Department of Homeland Security memo obtained exclusively by The Nation.The memo requests 1000 military personnel to support CBP operations at the northern border and an additional 540 for the southwest border an operation it anticipates will last through September 30. The troops stationed there would “increase CBP’s capacity to protect public health and prevent the spread of COVID-19” granting Border Patrol the ability to coordinate operational use of military assets and resources.This would represent an increase to the 5200 troops already at the border because of President Trump’s declaration of a national emergency over undocumented immigration in February 2019.“Any unknown or unresolved illegal entries into the United States in between Ports of Entry (POE) have the potential to spread infectious disease” the memo states echoing Trump’s past rhetoric equating migrants with disease.Trump has accused Mexican migrants of bringing “tremendous infectious disease…pouring across the border.” He has also said that “open borders…brings large scale crime and disease” and insists on calling COVID-19 a “Chinese” virus.Last week the Trump administration said it would block almost all border traffic from entering the United States—including asylum seekers attempting to enter lawfully through ports of entry. Earlier this week The Nation published a leaked Department of Homeland Security (DHS) document about COVID-19 showing that ICE detainees were being monitored and quarantined across 10 different facilities as well as that 1444 DHS employees were in precautionary self-quarantine—with its ICE and CBP employees among the most affected. (The DHS is ICE and CBP’s parent agency.)In July the DHS Inspector General issued a report that found “dangerous overcrowding” and squalid conditions in its migrant detention facilities—conditions that could propagate illnesses like the coronavirus. And earlier this week ICE detainees reportedly went on a hunger strike for soap.James Hodge director at the Center for Public Health Law and Policy at Arizona State University told The Nation that travel restrictions can have unintended consequences.“[It] is not something that CDC favors…it can be problematic” Hodge said explaining that it can lead to other countries retaliating with their own travel restrictions. This could leave many potentially healthy individuals trapped overseas.The World Health Organization (WHO) has also opposed travel restrictions specifically in relation to coronavirus on grounds that it can harm economies and encourage travelers to lie about their symptoms. In February its director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said “The WHO doesn’t recommend and actually opposes any restrictions for travel and trade or other measures against China.”The memo is titled “Request for Department of Defense (DoD) Assistance in Support of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) on the Northern and Southwest Borders to Prevent the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) and Maintain Public Health.” Marked “For Official Use Only // Law Enforcement Sensitive” the memo was provided by a Pentagon official who requested anonymity to avoid professional reprisal. The memo was sent from DHS’ Acting Executive Secretary Julianna Blackwell to the Defense Department’s Executive Secretary Capt. Oliver Lewis and is dated March 19.While the memo notes that CBP already enjoys enhanced enforcement measures it says they are still not adequate to maintain public health in the face of coronavirus. “CBP is undertaking enhanced enforcement and is collaborating with external partners to address cross border safety and security challenges. CBP cannot however effectively maintain public health measures and national security requirements without additional support.”The memo cites business performance and public confidence in the government as reasons for the deployment.“DHS’ overarching goal is to secure and manage the Nation’s borders while minimizing threats to public health thereby ensuring the safety of the DHS workforce and the environment where communities and businesses can thrive and people feel confident that the U.S. Government will respond to emergent public health threats in a reliable and sustainable manner to maintain national security.”As with previous border deployments the memo stresses that the military will be operating in a support capacity and will not conduct civilian law enforcement activities—for example arresting undocumented migrants—while remaining under the military chain of command.The memo appears vague on use of force guidelines stating that “use of force will be informed by the circumstances of their missions and made by DoD as appropriate in consultation with CBP.”
500,How Progressive Is the Stimulus?,Joelle Gamble,The Nation,-2,https://www.thenation.com/article/economy/covid-economy-unemployment-stimulus/,“Say it loud say it proud: We’re all Keynesians now.” This riff on public spending attributed to free-marketeer Milton Friedman is also a good description of US senators and White House officials negotiating over the third stimulus package amid record unemployment claims totaling 3.2 million and little prospect of a recovery anytime soon.At more than $2 trillion the bill proposed earlier this week is the largest single stimulus in US history. Republicans in the White House and Senate clearly aren’t the deficit hawks they claim to be. Nor should they be. The deep economic problems in the United States exacerbated by the global spread of the novel coronavirus have made it clear that larger deficits are not only an inevitability but a necessity.A handful of conservative politicians are even taking unexpected political stances: Take Mitt Romney pushing for cash transfers or Chuck Grassley defending a generous expansion of unemployment insurance. But beware: Their positions don’t pave the path for a political realignment in progressives’ favor. The provisions in this package—industry bailouts cash assistance expanded unemployment insurance and emergency support for educational institutions—instead represent an effort to return the economy to the way it was a few months ago. The big assumption here is that things were good then. They weren’t.Decades of trickle-down economics have resulted in stagnant wages declining economic mobility and weakening bargaining power for working people. This crisis just like the 2008 financial crisis that came before it is having its more direct immediate and severe impacts on exactly those working people who have been living in economic precarity.Covid-19 magnified the scale of an economy that is dramatically out of whack: one in which the rules have been manipulated at the expense of working people. The Republican leadership is pouring money into the economy to return to a status quo with concentrated corporate power rampant inequality and few rights for working people. Senate Democrats’ hard-fought wins in this bill are an attempt to keep the stimulus from further exacerbating the flaws in our economy: protecting the few collective-bargaining agreements working people have limiting the ability of corporations to use bailout funds to enrich their shareholders and increasing the size of cash payments to working Americans.This fight made today a little less unstable for many Americans. Tomorrow is still uncertain. There is a difference between giving working people economic relief and working people gaining power in the economy. Relief is a respite from harm. Power undergirds our ability to transform our own lives. A progressive stimulus bridges the short-term relief measures like unemployment insurance expansion with investments in permanent worker protections access to care and a Green New Deal–style stimulus.For example the Senate stimulus package now protects existing collective-bargaining agreements for unionized employees at companies receiving federal loans. A transformative approach would extend bargaining power to all employees at companies receiving loans. Or it would mandate that people at those firms have a seat on company boards. We have not dramatically updated our federal labor laws since the FDR era. That failure is one of the reasons recent economic recoveries have benefited those at the top..The Senate bill contains $377 billion in aid to small businesses in an effort to keep them afloat and keep people on their payroll. This is the right thing. The concern however are places where the “right thing” is a hope not a guarantee. Past is prologue: In 2008 the federal government bailed out the banks with little oversight. Banks in 2018 could be 2020 airlines. According to Bloomberg News the biggest US airlines spent 96 percent of free cash flow over the last decade on buying back their own shares. American Airlines led the pack and repurchased more than $12.5 billion of its shares. That $12.5 billion could have paid the annual salaries of 400000 people who handle luggage push wheelchairs and keep airports clean.While there are some strings attached to industry bailouts history will repeat itself without more robust competition policy financial regulation and a reimagining of corporate governance in the United States.The progressive takeaway from this crisis is that the economy is deeply shaped by government action. Markets alone cannot solve all economic woes especially when people cannot even physically access them. The difference between the conveniently Keynesian conservative approach to stimulus and a progressive vision is a recognition that the role for government does not stop when the stock market says it should.The economic response to this crisis must first and foremost meet the immediate dire needs of the people and small businesses whose lives have been forever changed. But it also must acknowledge the unstable system and rules and power imbalances that have made this crisis worse. The response to this crisis provides an opportunity to rewrite the rules of the economy and balance power in the right direction to put working families small businesses and our economy on sounder footing so that we can not only imagine but create a most just equitable and secure economic system that works for everyone.
501,Bailouts Are Coming. Here’s How to Make Them Fair.,Bryce Covert,The Nation,-2,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/coronavirus-bailouts-stimulus-workers/,The bailouts are coming. As the coronavirus brings economic activity grinding to a halt industries are flocking to the federal government with palms outstretched. An airline industry trade organization has already asked for nearly $60 billion. Those companies are likely to get something: President Trump has already said “We don’t want airlines going out of business.” Yet the last time we bailed them out after 9/11 we handed the industry billions of dollars in loans and grants while requiring very little in return.This time we have to demand concessions for our money. The companies that get taxpayer bailouts should be required to keep employees and contractors on their payrolls and leave union contracts and benefits intact. In the early 2000s airlines laid off tens of thousands of workers many of whom were never rehired. Now we can take a cue from the UK where the conservative government is offering grants that would cover up to 80 percent of salaries to employers that avoid layoffs.But that’s not all we should demand. Government help should come on the condition that airlines reform the way they operate. Contract airport workers deserve a minimum wage of at least $15 an hour and benefits like paid sick leave and affordable health care. And rather than let airlines increase customer fees while shrinking seats and services even during boom times we should impose caps on fees and demand better in-flight experiences. Once we get through this crisis the airlines will almost certainly be able to afford it. They had nearly $13 billion in operating revenue last year but the major carriers spent 96 percent of their cash over the past decade on buying back their own stock. That enriched their shareholders but left little for investments in better service or employee treatment. We can’t just hope that the airlines will end stock buybacks in favor of investments; we have to bar them from handing all their cash to shareholders.obs. But hotels must also keep employees on their payrolls if they get taxpayer funds—and hotel workers also deserve a $15 minimum hourly wage benefits and humane schedules. Meanwhile casinos and cruise lines are seeking their own pots of taxpayer money. All their laid-off workers should get financial assistance without question. But as leisure industries these companies are not indispensable to the functioning of the larger economy. Not all industries merit bailouts.Other industries are also likely to receive government assistance. Hotels are reeling; one union official in the industry has predicted that 95 percent of his members could lose their jPublic transportation on the other hand has barely been mentioned and yet is fundamental to the economy in many cities and states. Social distancing orders are rightly discouraging people from riding trains buses and subways. Ridership in New York City and New Jersey has already dropped by more than half. And beyond the loss of fares transit agencies will also face the loss of state and local tax revenue. Unions representing transit workers have told Congress that public transportation systems need $16 billion immediately to keep their operations running. The federal government must step in here.Then there are the institutions that make a society what it is. Libraries could face local funding cuts and museums are losing out on ticket sales. Small restaurants and mom-and-pop shops will struggle to reopen given their razor-thin margins. The National Restaurant Association has estimated that the industry as a whole will lose as many as 7 million jobs. These local businesses and cultural institutions should all be included in a bailout package even if they don’t have lobbying clout.Instead of showering cash on politically connected companies—our president of course once owned casinos and still owns hotels—the federal government needs to seriously consider which industries are vital to the continued functioning of our economy. It may be in our national interest to bail out some massive previously profitable sectors. But that money shouldn’t come for free.
502,Thomas Piketty: Confronting Our Long History of Massive Inequality,Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins,The Nation,-2,https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/thomas-piketty-interview-inequality-book-covid/,Thomas Piketty’s voluminous 2013 book Capital in the Twenty-First Century created a rare academic frenzy in this country and beyond. It did so by playing a major role in offering a specific explanation for growing inequality supported by an incredible amount of historical and statistical evidence going back to the 18th century in France the United States Britain and Germany. The rate of return on inherited wealth in an economy he argued will always grow faster than the income one earns through compensated labor. Increasing inequality is thus part of the very nature of capitalism Piketty observed and can only be checked through various kinds of state intervention. Critics of Piketty’s book abound in all parts of the political spectrum but it cannot be denied that Capital in the Twenty-First Century symbolized an emerging ethos in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.Seven years later Piketty has returned with an even bigger and more ambitious book: Capital and Ideology. He sees this book as a follow-up to Capital in the Twenty-First Century but advances his findings in two ways: First the previous book’s claim that inequality tends to rise when the average rate of return on capital exceeds the economy’s growth rate gave the impression that there was a kind of law-like necessity to capital an impression that little can be done to change the institutions that produce inequality aside from taxing them. Instead the new book boldly proclaims that inequality is ultimately rooted in ideology. “Every human society must justify its inequalities; unless reasons for them are found the whole political and social edifice stands in danger of collapse.” Societies justify inequalities he argues through “the realm of ideas” or what he describes as “the political-ideological sphere” which “is truly autonomous.” Such a claim is sure to be debated. But the reason Piketty defends it is clear: to show that inequality is not natural and that it can be confronted and reshaped through sociopolitical mobilization.And second Piketty moves beyond the narrow geographical focus of Capital in the Twenty-First Century to offer a global history of how different political systems have justified inequality and how these systems have been transformed over time. These inequality regimes as Piketty describes them include: ternary societies—composed of clergy nobility and common people—like the feudal system in pre-modern Europe or the Indian caste system; 19th and early 20th century ownership societies like the bourgeois property-rights systems in France and Britain; 20th-century social democracies which emerged in Europe after World War II; and what he describes as the “hypercapitalism” of the postcommunist world order.By focusing on the transformation of the underlying ideologies of these inequality regimes Piketty shows that “sociopolitical mobilizations can reshape the organization of societies and inequality structures much faster than what most contemporary observers tend to imagine.” It is in this spirit that Piketty offers his own policy proposals such as power sharing in firms a progressive wealth tax a temporary ownership plan (the idea that the wealthiest private owners must return part of what they own to the community every year to facilitate the circulation of wealth) and various solutions for making Western societies more democratic.Piketty spoke with The Nation about how his new book differs from the first his thoughts about ideology his progressive policy suggestions for curbing inequality and COVID-19.—Daniel Steinmetz-JenkinsDaniel Steinmetz-Jenkins: The blockbuster success of Capital in the Twenty-First Century clearly caught you off guard. Now six years later you have written Capital and Ideology which is nearly twice the length and unusually ambitious in its attempt to provide a long ranging historical explanation for modern inequality on a global scale. Do you feel a certain pressure to make this book live up to the expectations set by the previous work?Thomas Piketty: I believe this book is much richer and much more interesting than the previous one. Capital in the Twenty-First Century has many limitations. In particular it is far too Western-centered. In addition it tends to treat ideology and political attitudes toward equality and inequality as a kind of “black box.” In Capital and Ideology I try to address these two limitations by taking a more global perspective on the evolution of inequality structures—in India Brazil South Africa China Russia etc.—and devoting substantial attention to colonial societies and the modern legacies of slavery and colonialism. I also focus my attention on the transformation of the ideology of equality and inequality that is at the history of the different systems of justification of inequality. By looking at a broader range of historical experiences and trajectories a strong conclusion emerges: the determinants of inequality are primarily political and ideological rather than merely economic technological or cultural. Throughout history I find sociopolitical mobilizations can reshape the organization of societies and inequality structures much faster than what most contemporary observers tend to imagine. In particular elites often tend to naturalize inequality i.e. to present the currently existing structure and level of inequality as “natural” and permanent. But this is not at all what we observe in history.DSJ: In Capital in the Twentieth Century you argued that there are “Fundamental Laws of Capitalism” and in particular claimed that inequality tends to rise when the average rate of return on capital exceeds the economy’s growth rate. By imputing a kind of law-like necessity to capital you gave the impression to some that there is little that can be done to change the institutions that produce inequality aside from taxing them. But the new book it seems to me tries to resist such a reading by insisting that “inequality is neither economic nor technological; it is ideological and political.” What do you mean by this?TP: In my previous book I indeed stressed the role played by the rate of return on capital but I did not intend to take a deterministic approach to this. In particular I emphasized the fact that the rate of return obtained by large wealth portfolios in global financial markets has been far greater than the world economy growth’s rate in recent decades and the need for policy actions—including progressive wealth taxes—in order to curb these inequality trends. This theme also plays a role in my new book and indeed top billionaire wealth has kept increasing at a very high rate over the past ten years which probably contributes to explaining why democratic candidates like Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren now advocate sharply progressive wealth taxes which was not the case a couple of years ago.I now take a much broader look at how the ideological transformations of the legal fiscal and educational systems have defined and redefined inequality regimes across space and time. Take the case of Sweden. Today many people look at Sweden as intrinsically egalitarian and sometime attribute this to some kind of permanent Swedish “culture.” But that’s not so: Until the beginning of the 20th century Sweden was a highly unequal country and in many ways much more unequal than other European societies particularly in its way of organizing the political domination of the nobility and the property owners over the rest of society. Between 1865 and 1911 the Swedish constitution applies a very imaginative system whereby only the top 20% property owners can vote. Members of this group have between one and one hundred votes depending on the amount of their property and taxes. In municipal elections there was no upper limit (and corporations have the right to vote) so that in several dozen Swedish municipalities more than 50 percent of the votes were held by a single vote. Following an intense (but relatively peaceful) mobilization by trade unions and the Swedish social-democratic party (SAP) things changed at a speed that nobody could have imagined at the time. Universal suffrage was imposed the SAP took power in 1932 and Sweden’s administrative and state capacity was put to the service of a completely different political project. The careful registration of property and income was used to make people pay progressive taxes in order to finance education and health for all (rather than to distribute voting rights in relation to wealth). Throughout my book whether I talk about Sweden India the US France or China I try to show that the level of equality or inequality is shaped by sociopolitical mobilization and ideological changes rather than by permanent and deterministic factors.DSJ: The global scale of your book can be daunting for the reader. A case in point is your analysis of different ideological regimes of the 19th century such as bourgeois “ownership societies” in France and Britain “slave societies” in the United States and Brazil and “colonial societies” such as India and the countries of Africa. All these regimes you show provided different justifications for inequality and yet there does seem to be a common thread that holds the various types of regimes together namely that they are beholden to what you describe as the ideology of proprietarianism. Can you elaborate on this ideology?TP: In premodern societies inequality regimes were structured around trifunctional ideologies. The nobility and the clergy were property-owning classes but at the same time they were endowed with specific privileges and missions (law and order for the nobility spiritual guidance and education for the clergy). Following the French and US revolutions a new ideal emerged: everybody should have the same formal legal rights and in particular the right to hold property. In practice however effective access to property was largely restricted to a very small part of the population. Throughout the 19th century and pretty much until World War I the concentration of wealth and economic power remained extremely high. The global accumulation of assets reached unprecedented levels in the context of Atlantic slavery and post-slavery colonial societies.Things could have turned out differently. At the end of the 18th century a number of thinkers—for example Thomas Paine and the Marquis de Condorcet—did propose to put in place ambitious systems of progressive income and inheritance taxation in order to finance access to education and property (e.g. via a universal capital endowment in the case of Paine) and to abolish slavery with no financial compensation to slaveowners (or even with a compensation to former slaves in the case of Condorcet). Unfortunately the balance of power between groups which is always at the same time material and ideological did not allow this trajectory to be taken.During the 19th century and until 1914 the dominant discourse largely relies on the sacralization of property: progressive taxation is impeached (in accordance with the view that the opening of the Pandora’s box of property rights will eventually destabilize the whole social order an argument we still find in Hayek’s writings in the 1980s) and slaveowners are to be fully compensated for their loss of property (under the same argument: if you expropriate a slaveowner with no compensation what will you do with someone who rebalanced his portfolio and sold his slaves a few years ago?). This is how “liberal” intellectuals like Tocqueville defend the absolute moral necessity of a full financial compensation to slaveowners. This is also how Haiti ended up repaying an enormous public debt to the former French slaveowners over more than a century between 1825 and 1950.Things finally changed over the course of the 20th century. The rights of property owners were counterbalanced with the rights of workers consumers and local governments; the concentration of income and property was curbed by steeply progressive taxation; and a more equal access to education and health was developed. This led to a sustained decline in inequality a rise in mobility and an increase in economic prosperity and growth. We now know (or should know) that the key to prosperity is education and (relative) equality rather than the sacralization of inequality and property. But it took major shocks for these new solutions to be experimented with and unfortunately human societies sometimes have short memories.DSJ: Let’s turn to the present political moment one that given Donald Trump’s presidency Brexit and the global turn to nationalism is typically described as being a populist reaction to the undoing of the social-democratic regime by neoliberalism. You don’t like the term “populism.” Why is that?TP: The problem is that the term “populism” is used to refer to completely different things. Some people would like to use it to refer to both Trump and Sanders in the US or to Bolsonaro and Lula in Brazil or to Le Pen and Mélenchon in France. Very often it is used as a convenient rhetorical device by people who claim to be in the center (but in practice are often extremist neoliberals!) who wish to disqualify anyone who disagrees with them and who manages to attract lower-class socioeconomic voters a bit more than they do (which is not setting the bar very high). When I talk about Trump and Sanders Bolsonaro and Lula Le Pen and Mélenchon I prefer to talk about nationalism vs. socialism. Of course there are enormous variations within these two ideological families just as there are within the liberal and neoliberal ideologies (by the way I prefer to refer to a “neoproprietarian” ideology rather than to “neoliberalism” so as to stress the key role of property relations and to avoid the ambiguities associated with the idea of liberalism). The purpose of my historical inquiry is to try to give more precise content to these ideas and to analyze how they evolve over time and around us. But the point is that “nationalism” and “socialism” appear to be more useful terms than that of “populism.”DSJ: You suggest in the book that the left around the globe has now become dominated by what you describe as the emergence of a Brahmin educational elite that defends cultural diversity. Its main rival you state has been a commercially minded merchant right that defends the free market. Having experienced neither the elite education of the Brahmin left nor the prosperity of the merchant right those excluded you argue now turn to nativist parties. To what extent do you think the Brahmin left and the merchant right might form a coalition or even a party to confront the new nationalist movements?TP: The Brahmin left may not offer much in terms of redistribution and social policies but this is still better than the merchant right especially given that the latter has become more and more xenophobic over time (as exemplified by Trump). The possibility of a coalition between the most affluent and the most internationalist segments of the Brahmin left and the merchant right corresponds to the strategy followed by Macron in France. The problem is that this coalition of the elites has very limited appeal for lower-class and lower-middle-class voters and may finally lose the battle against the social-nativist coalition.Le Pen might still be far from winning a national election in France but it is not entirely impossible that her party could take control of a couple of regions in the regional elections of 2021. In the longer run the Macron coalition of the Brahmin left and the merchant right opens the way for a sort of French Salvini—the recent former deputy prime minister and interior minister of Italy. The general problem that we are facing is the following: If we do not open up new perspectives in terms of social progress and economic justice and if the “neoliberal centrists” keep pretending that there is only one possible economic policy (basically to the benefit of the most affluent) then we run the risk that the political discussion is going to be more and more about identity which will provide a winning ground for the nationalists and the nativists.DSJ: You have a lot of ideas for how to overcome the growing appeal of nativism such as sharing power in firms a progressive wealth tax a temporary ownership plan—the idea that the wealthiest private owners must return part of what they own to the community every year to facilitate the circulation of wealth—and making the EU more democratic. What though is the place of grassroots politics and social movements in your vision of social change both past and future?TP: Real change always has to come from grassroots politics and social movements. All I am doing in this book is attempting to put into a broad historical and comparative perspective a number of evolutions that have already started to happen. The progressive wealth tax is now being proposed by a number of Democratic candidates in the US and the German Social-Democrats also propose to reintroduce it. Things were very different just five or ten years ago. Ideas about co-management and increasing workers’ rights on corporate boards are now being discussed in Britain France and in the US while historically they have been limited to countries like Germany and Sweden. With citizens from all across Europe we have also developed a manifesto to transform European institutions in a social-federalist direction. All across the world we see social movements demanding more economic justice and we also see the need to rethink the organization of economic globalization in order to address social and environmental changes.Of course it is always possible to go further and faster. In my book I propose the concepts of participatory socialism and social-federalism to describe these transformations and to offer a perspective on them. Participatory socialism rests on two main pillars: educational justice and the permanent circulation of property. Educational justice must be effective and verifiable which is not at all the case today: in many countries including France socially disadvantaged children actually receive smaller educational investments than socially advantaged kids do. The permanent circulation of property requires the “inheritance for all” scheme (so as to rebalance bargaining power in society) more voting rights for workers and a limitation of the concentration of voting rights for single shareholders in large companies. The basic idea of “social-federalism” is that socioeconomic relations between countries should be subject to binding objectives regarding social fiscal and environmental justice. In other words you cannot have free capital flows and free exchange of goods and services if you do not have a common and verifiable system of social objectives (a minimum wage labor rights etc.) fiscal justice (minimal common taxation of the largest transnational economic actors) and environmental protection (such as verifiable targets of carbon emissions).It will take time but I think that in the long run we’ll be moving in this sort of direction. For a simple reason: the nationalist and nativist road map that we see today with Trump Johnson Le Pen or Modi might be easier to follow in order to gain immediate popularity; but in the long run. it will not solve the social and environmental problems that we need to solve and that are not going to go away.DSJ: COVID-19 has caught the world off guard and the coming economic consequences of the pandemic appears to be a global crisis the scale of which is difficult to predict. What must be done to adequately address the situation and to what extent is the ability of political and economic actors limited by the institutional arrangements that have exacerbated growing inequality in recent years?TP: Times of crisis are times when existing conceptions about the economy are being challenged and when new political-ideological trajectories can arise. COVID-19 illustrates the fact that public authorities can choose to regulate economic forces if they so wish. The question is whether we’ll be able to act strongly in order to address global warming or rising inequality. Together with the 2008-2012 bank bailout and money creation the 2020 health crisis will challenge long-standing discourses about laissez-faire and will feed social demand for other intervention. For now however the only issue is survival: we need to do everything we can to avoid a dreadful rise in the number of casualties.
503,‘Just Keep Up the Faith’: Workers Are Stepping Up to Beat the Coronavirus,John Nichols,The Nation,-2,https://www.thenation.com/article/society/workers-unions-ventilators-coronavirus/,“Every ventilator we get off the end of our line and out of our building is saving a life” says Trevar Smedal. He works at a GE Datex-Ohmeda manufacturing plant where production has ramped up and shifts have been added so that assembly of the life-saving equipment can continue around the clock.As the number of confirmed coronavirus cases increases nurses doctors and governors across the country are echoing the passionate language of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo when he speaks of the “critical and desperate need for ventilators.”Studies from China determined that when the outbreak was at its peak there roughly 5 percent of patients went into intensive care and 2.3 percent required the ventilator devices that pump oxygen into the lungs until people have recovered sufficiently to breathe on their own. “Now imagine 2.3 percent of the perhaps millions of Americans who are expected to become infected with Covid-19 over the next three months” explains Daniel M. Horn a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital. “There simply will not be enough of these machines especially in major cities.”That terrifying prospect has given Smedal and his fellow members of International Association of Machinists (IAM) union Local 1406 in Madison Wisconsin a sense of mission. “The term ‘this is a wartime situation’ has definitely flown around our plant quite a bit” explains the 30-year-old who has been pulling 12-hour shifts since February without a day off. “We are not going to shut our doors. When everybody else is out there really stressing out about what’s going to happen in the future we can’t really dwell on that—because we got to get this stuff done. We’ve got to show up every day and get as many of these machines out to the people all over the world.”The machinists union and the AFL-CIO have circulated a brief video of Smedal as part of an effort to highlight the role union workers have played in addressing the coronavirus outbreak. Looking into the camera he tells an anxious America “Just keep up the faith. I know that my coworkers we’re going to show up every day and we’re going to get out as many as we can.”“They are literally saving lives” says IAM International President Robert Martinez Jr. who refers to the workers at the GE Datex-Ohmeda plant in Madison as an “inspiration to all of us in a time when the whole world needs to be joining together in solidarity to tackle this pandemic.”Solidarity is vital. With it goes an understanding of the sacrifices workers are making when they leave the safety of their homes to provide essential services.The battle to get ahead of the coronavirus curve is so serious and so demanding that the list of working-class heroes grows with each passing day. Nurses and doctors are on the front lines. With them stand respiratory therapists technicians assistants janitors cooks and all the other workers who are keeping hospitals going amid the overwhelming challenge that we are asking them to take on. The Senate’s “phase three” response to the pandemic includes $100 billion in funding for hospitals. That aid is critical. But there’s more much more to be done.“We hear from scores of nurses every day across the U.S. and many of them in California” says Bonnie Castillo RN the executive director of the California Nurses Association and the National Nurses United union. “They still do not have access to proper protective masks such as N95 respirators and full head-to-toe protective clothing. They fear for their safety for their patients’ safety for their family’s safety and for their co-workers’ safety. If they are not protected and safe more people will die and the virus will continue to spread in greater numbers.”The nurses union has launched a national “Protect Nurses—All Our Lives Depend On It” campaign which asks Congress to “mandate an emergency temporary OSHA standard so that frontline health care workers treating COVID-19 patients have the necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) they need to prevent them from contracting the virus themselves.”As lockdowns are initiated and “stay-at-home” orders are issued across the country millions of workers are still being asked to leave their homes and their families to provide essential services in their communities. On Wednesday in Pittsburgh sanitation workers refused to pick up trash until their demands for safety gear—masks an extra set of boots more gloves—were addressed.“We’re kind of taken for granted because they don’t have to call for us like they have to call for the fire and police” explained sanitation worker Tom Foley. “We just show up and do our job.” There were reports from around the country of delivery drivers for Dominoes and Amazon workers demanding safer working conditions and paid time off.The Amalgamated Transit Union has set up a national command center with hotlines for workers and union representatives to ensure that union members get the protection they need to keep drivers and other workers safe and healthy. This is vital not just for keeping enough buses and trains rolling through cities that are locked down but also in places where health care workers and others need transportation.“We’re essential to [the] battle against COVID-19 trying to get other first responders to the front line to keep the economy going” says John Costa the international president of ATU. “Yet our members—bus drivers rail operators and the mechanics and other transit workers maintaining and disinfecting vehicles—are being unnecessarily exposed to coronavirus due to negligence and disregard by many contractors and transit agencies across North America.”That’s a reasonable demand in an unreasonable moment. The latest congressional response to the coronavirus threat includes $25 billion in emergency transit funding. That’s important but now federal state and local officials need to make sure not just that the money allocated for this fight is spent well and wisely but also that the resources are coupled with a commitment to protect and support the people who are on the job even as communities shut down.Workers will do the rest. They are stepping up to save lives working in demanding circumstances for long hours—often with little notice. But we must notice their show of solidarity.“People will start to burn out and it will be hard to continue it continue the upswing of production” says Smedal as he describes his work on the ventilator line. “That’s kind of where being in a union being brothers and sisters comes into play. We kind of keep each other motivated—make sure people are staying healthy getting enough to eat getting enough sleep.”Recalling the reference to “a wartime situation” Smedal explains “My sister for example she’s a doctor in Cincinnati—so you can say she’s definitely on the frontlines right now. I guess I’m kind of in the background putting the machines together.” On the day we spoke Trevar told me his sister had called to tell him about hooking a young patient up to a ventilator.Trevar Smedal’s sister is a hero. So is he.
504,How Does the Coronavirus Behave Inside a Patient?,Siddhartha Mukherjee,The New Yorker,-2,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/04/06/how-does-the-coronavirus-behave-inside-a-patient,In the third week of February as the covid-19 epidemic was still flaring in China I arrived in Kolkata India. I woke up to a sweltering morning—the black kites outside my hotel room were circling upward lifted by the warming currents of air—and I went to visit a shrine to the goddess Shitala. Her name means “the cool one”; as the myth has it she arose from the cold ashes of a sacrificial fire. The heat that she is supposed to diffuse is not just the fury of summer that hits the city in mid-June but also the inner heat of inflammation. She is meant to protect children from smallpox heal the pain of those who contract it and dampen the fury of a pox epidemic.The shrine was a small structure within a temple a few blocks from Kolkata Medical College. Inside there was a figurine of the goddess sitting on a donkey and carrying her jar of cooling liquid—the way she has been depicted for a millennium. The temple was two hundred and fifty years old the attendant informed me. That would date it to around the time when accounts first appeared of a mysterious sect of Brahmans wandering up and down the Gangetic plain to popularize the practice of tika an early effort at inoculation. This involved taking matter from a smallpox patient’s pustule—a snake pit of live virus—and applying it to the pricked skin of an uninfected person then covering the spot with a linen rag.The Indian practitioners of tika had likely learned it from Arabic physicians who had learned it from the Chinese. As early as 1100 medical healers in China had realized that those who survived smallpox did not catch the illness again (survivors of the disease were enlisted to take care of new victims) and inferred that the exposure of the body to an illness protected it from future instances of that illness. Chinese doctors would grind smallpox scabs into a powder and insufflate it into a child’s nostril with a long silver pipe.Vaccination with live virus was a tightrope walk: if the amount of viral inoculum in the powder was too great the child would succumb to a full-fledged version of the disease—a disaster that occurred perhaps one in a hundred times. If all went well the child would have a mild experience of the disease and be immunized for life. By the seventeen-hundreds the practice had spread throughout the Arab world. In the seventeen-sixties women in Sudan practiced tishteree el jidderee (“buying the pox”): one mother haggling with another over how many of a sick child’s ripe pustules she would buy for her own son or daughter. It was an exquisitely measured art: the most astute traditional healers recognized the lesions that were likely to yield just enough viral material but not too much. The European name for the disease variola comes from the Latin for “spotted” or “pimpled.” The process of immunizing against the pox was called “variolation.”Lady Mary Wortley Montagu the wife of the British Ambassador to Constantinople had herself been stricken by the disease in 1715 leaving her perfect skin pitted with scars. Later in the Turkish countryside she witnessed the practice of variolation and wrote to her friends in wonder describing the work of one specialist: “The old woman comes with a nut-shell full of the matter of the best sort of small-pox and asks what vein you please to have opened” whereupon she “puts into the vein as much matter as can lie upon the head of her needle.” Patients retired to bed for a couple of days with a fever and Lady Montagu noted emerged remarkably unscathed. “They have very rarely above twenty or thirty in their faces which never mark; and in eight days’ time they are as well as before their illness.” She reported that thousands safely underwent the operation every year and that the disease had largely been contained in the region. “You may believe I am well satisfied of the safety of this experiment” she added “since I intend to try it on my dear little son.” Her son never got the pox.In the centuries since Lady Montagu marvelled at the efficacy of inoculation we’ve made unimaginable discoveries in the biology and epidemiology of infectious disease and yet the covid-19 pandemic poses no shortage of puzzles. Why did it spread like wildfire in Italy thousands of miles from its initial epicenter in Wuhan while India appears so far to have largely been spared? What animal species transmitted the original infection to humans?But three questions deserve particular attention because their answers could change the way we isolate treat and manage patients. First what can we learn about the “dose-response curve” for the initial infection—that is can we quantify the increase in the risk of infection as people are exposed to higher doses of the virus? Second is there a relationship between that initial “dose” of virus and the severity of the disease—that is does more exposure result in graver illness? And third are there quantitative measures of how the virus behaves in infected patients (e.g. the peak of your body’s viral load the patterns of its rise and fall) that predict the severity of their illness and how infectious they are to others? So far in the early phases of the covid-19 pandemic we have been measuring the spread of the virus across people. As the pace of the pandemic escalates we also need to start measuring the virus within people.Most epidemiologists given the paucity of data have been forced to model the spread of the new coronavirus as if it were a binary phenomenon: individuals are either exposed or unexposed infected or uninfected symptomatic patients or asymptomatic carriers. Recently the Washington Post published a particularly striking online simulation in which people in a city were depicted as dots moving freely in space—uninfected ones in gray infected ones in red (then shifting to pink as immunity was acquired). Each time a red dot touched a gray dot the infection was transmitted. With no intervention the whole field of dots steadily turned from gray to red. Social distancing and isolation kept the dots from knocking into one another and slowed the spread of red across the screen.This was a bird’s-eye view of a virus radiating through a population seen as an “on-off” phenomenon. The doctor and medical researcher in me—as a graduate student I was trained in viral immunology—wanted to know what was going on within the dots. How much virus was in that red dot? How fast was it replicating in this dot? How was the exposure—the “touch time”—related to the chance of transmission? How long did a red dot remain red—that is how did an individual’s infectiousness change over time? And what was the severity of disease in each case?What we’ve learned about other viruses—including the ones that cause aids sars and smallpox—suggests a more complex view of the disease its rate of progression and strategies for containment. In the nineteen-nineties as researchers learned to measure how much H.I.V. was in a patient’s blood a distinct pattern emerged. After an infection the virus count in the blood would rise to a zenith known as “peak viremia” and patients with the highest peak viremia typically became sicker sooner; they were least able to resist the virus. Even more predictive than the peak viral load was the so-called set point—the level at which someone’s virus count settled after its initial peak. It represented a dynamic equilibrium that was reached between the virus and its human host. People with a high set point tended to progress more rapidly to aids; people with a low set point frequently proved to be “slow progressors.” The viral load—a continuum not a binary value—helped predict the nature course and transmissibility of the disease. To be sure every virus has its own personality and H.I.V. has traits that make viral load especially revealing: it causes a chronic infection and one that specifically targets cells of the immune system. Yet similar patterns have been observed with other viruses.And immunologically that’s not surprising. If your system is able to combat viral replication with some efficiency—owing to your age your genetics and other indices of immune competence—you’ll have a lower set point. Could a lower initial exposure as with children treated with tika also lead to a lower set point? Faced with a smaller challenge the immune system could have a greater chance of controlling the pathogen. In contrast if you’re inundated with multiple high-dose exposures the swiftly replicating invader could gain ground that the immune system might be hard-pressed to reconquer.An ingenious study on the relationship between the intensity of viral exposure and infectivity in human beings comes from a team at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington in Seattle. In 2018 an epidemiologist and statistician named Bryan Mayer joined a group of physicians and biologists who were researching a problem that seemed on its face almost impossible to tackle. Mayer who is in his mid-thirties is soft-spoken and precise: he uses words carefully and speaks in long slow sentences. “Even as a graduate student I was interested in the idea of a dose of a virus or a pathogen” he told me. “But the problem is that the initial dose is often impossible to capture because you only know a person is infected after he or she has been infected.” Most infectious diseases can only be viewed in a rearview mirror: by the time a patient becomes a patient that critical moment of transmission has already passed.But the researchers found an unusual resource: a cohort of new mothers and their children in Kampala Uganda. A few years earlier a pediatrician named Soren Gantt and a team of doctors examined these women and asked them to provide oral swabs for a year. Then they measured how much the women shed a virus called HHV-6 which is usually spread through oral secretions to an infant after birth and which causes fever and a red whole-body rash. It was now possible to investigate how the amount of virus-shedding—the “dose” of exposure—affected the likelihood of a newborn infant becoming infected. Gantt Mayer and their colleagues had devised a way to eavesdrop on the dynamics of the transmission of a human viral infection from the very start. “Our data confirmed that there’s a dose-response relationship in viral transmissions for HHV-6” Mayer told me. “The more virus you shed the more likely you are to infect others.” He’d managed to turn around the rearview mirror of epidemiology.There’s another aspect of transmission and disease however: the host immune response. Viral attack and the immune system’s defense are two opposing forces constantly at odds. The Russian immunologist Ilya Metchnikoff working in the early nineteen-hundreds described the phenomenon as “the struggle”—or Kampf in German editions of his work. Metchnikoff imagined an ongoing battle between microbe and immunity. The Kampf was a matter of ground gained or lost. What was the total “force” of the microbial presence? What host factors—genetics prior exposure baseline immune competence—were limiting the microbial invasion? And then: was the initial equilibrium tipped toward the virus or toward the host?That raises the second question—does a larger viral “dose” result in more severe disease? It’s impossible to erase from one’s memory the image of Li Wenliang the thirty-three-year-old Chinese ophthalmologist who sounded the alarm on the first covid-19 cases in his final illness; a photograph shows him crimson-faced sweating and struggling to breathe in a face mask shortly before his death. Then there’s the unexpected death of Xia Sisi a twenty-nine-year-old doctor from Union Jiangbei Hospital of Wuhan who had a two-year-old child and the Times reported loved Sichuan hot pot. Another Chinese health-care worker a twenty-nine-year-old nurse in Wuhan fell so critically ill that she started hallucinating; later she would describe herself as “walking on the edge of death.”Could the striking severity of their disease—twenty- and thirty-year-olds with covid-19 generally experience a self-limited flu-like illness—be correlated with the amount of virus to which they were initially exposed? At least two E.R. doctors in the United States both on the front lines of the pandemic have also fallen critically ill; one of them in Washington State is only in his forties. To go by available data from Wuhan and Italy health-care workers don’t necessarily have a higher fatality rate but do they suffer disproportionately from the most severe forms of the disease? “We know the high mortality in older people” Peter Hotez an infectious-disease specialist and vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine told CNN. “But for reasons that we don’t understand front-line health-care workers are at great risk for serious illness despite their younger age.”Some suggestive research has been done with other viruses. In animal models of influenza it’s possible to precisely quantify exposure intensity and mice who were given higher doses of certain influenza viruses developed a more severe form of the disease. Yet the degree of correlation between dose and disease severity varied widely from one strain of the flu to the next. (Curiously in one study a higher initial load of respiratory syncytial virus which can cause pneumonia especially in young children correlated negatively with severe disease—although another study suggests that the correlation is positive with toddlers the most affected patient population.)What sparse evidence we have about coronaviruses suggests that they may follow the pattern seen in influenza. In a 2004 study of the coronavirus that causes sars a cousin of the one that causes covid-19 a team from Hong Kong found that a higher initial load of virus—measured in the nasopharynx the cavity in the deep part of your throat above your palate—was correlated with a more severe respiratory illness. Nearly all the sars patients who came in initially with a low or undetectable level of virus in the nasopharynx were found at a two-month follow-up to be still alive. Those with the highest level had a twenty- to forty-per-cent mortality rate. This pattern held true regardless of a patient’s age underlying conditions and the like. Research into another acute viral illness Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever reached a similar conclusion: the more virus you had at the start the more likely you were to die.Perhaps the strongest association between the intensity of exposure and the intensity of subsequent disease is seen in measles research. “I want to emphasize that measles and covid-19 are different diseases caused by very different viruses with different behaviors” Rik de Swart a virologist at Erasmus University in Rotterdam cautioned when we spoke “but in measles there are several clear indications that the severity of illness relates to the dose of exposure. And it makes immunological sense because the interaction between the virus and the immune system is a race in time. It’s a race between the virus finding enough target cells to replicate and the antiviral response aiming to eliminate the virus. If you give the virus a head start with a large dose you get higher viremia more dissemination higher infection and worse disease.”He described a study from 1994 in which researchers gave monkeys different doses of the measles virus and found that higher infection doses were associated with earlier peaks in viremia. In human beings de Swart added the best evidence comes from studies in sub-Saharan Africa. “If you acquire measles through household contacts where the density and dose of exposure is the highest—you might be sharing a bed with an infected child—then you typically have a higher risk of developing more severe illness” he said. “If a child contracts the disease through playground or casual contact the disease is usually less severe.”I discussed this aspect of infection with the Harvard virologist and immunologist Dan Barouch whose lab is among those that are working toward a vaccine against sars-CoV-2 the virus that causes covid-19. He told me that ongoing studies with macaques are investigating the relationship between the initial dose of the sars-CoV-2 viral inoculum and the amount of virus in lung secretions at a later time. He believes that there may be a correlation. “If we extended this logic to humans we would expect a similar relationship” he said. “And logically the larger amount of virus should trigger more severe disease by prompting a brisker inflammatory response. But that is still speculative. The relationship between initial viral dose and severity remains to be seen.”To answer the third question—whether we can track a covid-19 patient’s viral load in a way that helps us predict the course of the disease—we’ll need more quantitative research into sars-CoV-2 counts within patients. One unpublished German study has measured viral loads on oral swabs taken of both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Initially it was reported that patients who experienced no symptoms had slightly higher loads than those who fell ill. The results were curious. But at the time only seven patients had been studied. Sandra Ciesek the director of the Institute of Medical Virology in Frankfurt who was running the study told me that no significant differences between the two groups emerged as a larger patient population began to be sampled. “In swabs we don’t know of a correlation” she informed me. The problem with measuring viral loads in a swab is that it is “affected by preanalytic factors such as the way in which the swab is taken” she added. Oral swabs are notoriously affected by small variations in how they’re done. “But a correlation with severe disease may well be true for the viral load in blood.” Joshua Schiffer a clinical virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Center and a co-author of the HHV-6 study reports that more stringent nasal-swabbing methods for a range of respiratory viruses have yielded consistent reliable viral-load counts and that these loads have generally tracked well with disease symptoms and progression. In a paper published online by The Lancet Infectious Diseases in March researchers at the University of Hong Kong and Nanchang University reported that viral loads in nasopharyngeal swabs from a group of patients with severe covid-19 were sixty times higher on average than the loads among patients with a mild form of the disease.As the virus continues to cyclone across the world we will begin to find quantitative answers to these questions of how exposure intensity and subsequent viral loads relate to the clinical course of covid-19. We will supplement the bird’s-eye view with the worm’s-eye view. How will these insights change the way we manage patients hospitals and populations?Start with the relationship between exposure intensity and infection. Think for a moment of how we monitor those who work with radiation. Using radiation dosimetry we quantify someone’s total exposure and we set limits on it. We already know how critical it is for doctors and nurses to limit exposure to the coronavirus by using protective equipment (masks gloves gowns). But for health-care workers on the front lines of the covid-19 pandemic especially in places where protective equipment is scarce we might also keep track of total exposure and put in place viral-dosimetry controls so that one individual can avoid repeated interactions with some set of highly contagious patients.Establishing a relationship between dose and disease severity could in turn affect patient care. If we could identify pre-symptomatic patients who were likely exposed to the highest doses of viruses—someone cohabitating or socializing with multiple sick family members (as with the close-knit Fusco family of Freehold New Jersey which has had four deaths) or a nurse exposed to a set of patients shedding large amounts of the virus—we might predict a more severe experience of the disease and give them priority when it came to limited medical resources so that they could be treated faster earlier or more intensively.And finally the care of covid-19 patients could change if we began to track virus counts. These parameters could be gauged using fairly inexpensive and easily available laboratory methods. Imagine a two-step process: first identifying infected patients and then quantifying viral loads in nasal or respiratory secretions particularly in patients who are likely to require the highest level of treatment. Correlating virus counts and therapeutic measures with outcomes might result in different strategies of care or isolation.The value of a quantitative approach applies to clinical studies as well. Clinical drug trials are typically more informative when run on subjects who aren’t yet critical; once the subjects have reached that stage any therapy might be too little too late. And if the disease course in such patients is followed using viral-load metrics rather than by tracking symptoms alone the effect of a drug in different trials can be compared more easily and accurately.We will also want to be able to identify people who have recovered from infection have become immune to sars-CoV-2 and are no longer contagious. Such people must meet two criteria: they must have a measured absence of viral shedding and they must have signs of persistent immunity in their blood (something readily determined by an antibody test). As the Chinese discovered with smallpox in the twelfth century such individuals—especially those who are health-care workers—are of particular value to medicine: barring any decay in immunity they can generally tend to the sickest patients without getting sick themselves.My clinical practice is in oncology. Measurement and enumeration are the mainstays of medicine for people in my field: the size of a tumor the number of metastases the exact shrinkage of a malignant mass after chemotherapy. We talk about “risk stratification” (categorizing patients according to health status) and the “stratification of response” (categorizing patients according to their response to treatment). I am able to spend half an hour or more with every patient to describe risk explain how a remission is measured and carefully devise a clinical plan.A pandemic by contrast goes hand in hand with panic. Chaos reigns. Italian doctors are hanging I.V. drips on makeshift poles for patients lying on makeshift cots in makeshift wards. Measurement—viral-load testing—can seem like an improbable indulgence under such circumstances. But this crisis will require that we stratify and assess risk and deploy dwindling resources in the most effective manner.The word “epidemiology” is derived from “epi” and “demos”—“above the people.” It is the science of aggregation the science of the many. Yet it works most effectively when it moves in step with medicine the science of the one. On the morning I visited the Shitala shrine in Kolkata the goddess of bygone population-decimating epidemics was also serving as the personal goddess of a mother who had brought a child with a weeklong fever. To win the Kampf against covid-19 it’s essential to trace the course of the virus as it moves through populations. But it’s equally essential to measure its course within a single patient. The one becomes the many. Count both; both count. ♦
505,The Trump O’Clock Follies,Susan B. Glasser,The New Yorker,-2,https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/the-trump-oclock-follies,During the Vietnam War the United States had the Five O’Clock Follies nightly briefings at which American military leaders claimed citing a variety of bogus statistics half-truths and misleading reports from the front to be winning a war that they were in fact losing. Richard Pyle the Associated Press’s Saigon bureau chief called the press conferences “the longest-playing tragicomedy in Southeast Asia’s theater of the absurd” which minus the “Southeast Asia” part is not a bad description of the scene currently playing out each evening in the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room in the White House. We now have the Trump Follies the nightly briefings at which President Trump has lied and bragged lamented and equivocated about the global pandemic that poses an existential threat to his Presidency. Just as the Vietnam briefings became a standard by which the erosion of government credibility could be measured then historians of the future will consult the record of Trump’s mendacious misleading press conferences as an example of a tragic failure of leadership at such a critical moment. There will be much material for them; the transcripts from just the first three days of this week run to more than forty thousand words.Since Trump began making the press conferences a daily ritual a couple of weeks ago—an eternity in the pandemic era—his more memorable lines are already featuring in political attacks against him. “I don’t take responsibility at all” Trump insisted two weeks ago. When asked to assess his own performance he said “I’d rate it a ten.” This Wednesday with members of his coronavirus task force joining him onstage he added “We’ve done one hell of a job. Nobody has done the job that we’ve done. And it’s lucky that you have this group here right now for this problem or you wouldn’t even have a country left.”The New Yorker’s coronavirus news coverage and analysis are free for all readers.The disconnect between Trumpian reality and actual reality has never been on starker display than in the past few days as the true face of the horror we are facing in the United States has shown itself in New York City with overwhelmed morgues and emergency rooms a governor pleading for ventilators and face masks from the federal government and heartbreaking first-person accounts reminiscent of the open letters sent from Italy a few weeks back which warned Americans: this is what is coming for you—don’t make our mistakes. On Tuesday the World Health Organization said that the United States was emerging as the “epicenter” of the global pandemic which makes the James S. Brady Press Briefing Room the emerging epicenter of the failure to respond to it.A couple of weeks ago it seemed as if maybe that would not be the case. Although the Trump Administration had faltered and delayed and denied through the initial stages of the virus when it raged outside our borders it looked like it might finally get its act together and take this public-health menace seriously now that it was hitting in force inside the U.S. Trump declared a national emergency stepped up testing and on March 16th agreed to his crisis committee’s plan for a fifteen-day countrywide slowdown in order to “flatten the curve” of the disease’s trajectory. Barely a week into the fifteen days however Trump began signalling an abrupt change of course—at just the moment when the disease was accelerating its deadly progress through a wealthy nation that turned out to be surprisingly ill-prepared for it.Throughout this long strange March Trump has often framed the fight against the pandemic in martial terms: a “battle” to be won a victory to be achieved a shared sacrifice against “this invisible enemy” which would go on “until we have defeated the virus.” But the Commander-in-Chief did something extraordinary this week: he rebelled against his own clichés essentially declaring that he no longer wanted to be at war with the virus after all.On Sunday he prefigured this pivot apparently after watching the Fox News host Steve Hilton complain about the treatment—a shut-down country and a cratered economy—being worse than the disease. “WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF” Trump tweeted shortly before midnight. By the Monday-night edition of the Follies which are usually scheduled for 5 p.m. but often not started until later Trump was repeating this line over and over again. “We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself” he said. “We’re not going to let the cure be worse than the problem.” Later he added “We can’t have the cure be worse than the problem” and also “We can’t let that happen. . . . We can’t let this continue to go on.” America he said would be “open for business” soon.On Tuesday which marked a month since a now-infamous tweet in which the President claimed that “the Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA” Trump was even more specific. He announced that afternoon on a Fox News special from the White House lawn that he wanted to get the country reopened and the church pews “packed” by Easter on April 12th at just the time when New York and other states were predicted to face the maximum pressure on their overstretched medical facilities. A few hours later at the nightly press briefing he was asked about this seemingly arbitrary timetable by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins.“Who suggested Easter?” Collins asked. “Who suggested that day?” Trump replied “I just thought it was a beautiful time. It would be a beautiful time a beautiful timeline. It’s a great day.” Collins followed up: “So that wasn’t based on any of the data?” “I just think it would be a beautiful timeline” Trump responded.This was painfully revealing: the President under questioning by an independent reporter was admitting that he wanted to do something with no basis in science. In fact within minutes some of the nation’s leading experts on pandemics panned the suggestion as dangerous and ill conceived. By Wednesday Trump was still talking about an Easter deadline but only promising a new “recommendation” at that time. “I’m not going to do anything rash or hastily” he said which is as close to a reassuring statement from the President as he will ever offer.On Thursday Trump appeared before the cameras just before 5:30 p.m. minutes after the Times reported that the United States now had more than eighty-one thousand recorded cases of the coronavirus surpassing China as the world’s No. 1 country in terms of confirmed infections. When asked about the statistic Trump acted as though this too was some sort of an achievement of his to be praised saying that the high number was “a tribute to our testing.” Despite the day’s grim news with his Administration reporting a record-high week of unemployment claims Trump continued his upbeat tone. The world “is going to end up better than ever” he said before reading out all the names of the members of the G-20 world leaders with whom he had spoken that morning listing the provisions of the two-trillion-dollar emergency-aid package that Congress is finalizing and even reciting the number of gloves that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has sent to individual states. Eventually he got around to his main point which is that “we’ve gotta go back to work.” Earlier on Thursday his Administration had sent a letter to governors saying it would soon issue new guidelines rating U.S. counties by their varied levels of risk for the disease and suggesting that those with lower risk could resume business more quickly. Trump offered no specifics but touted it as a needed step. “I think it’s going to happen pretty quickly” he said. He never mentioned the word “Easter.”After all that it was hard not to think of Trump’s whole “beautiful timeline” as yet another monumental act of Presidential flimflammery a distracting week of misdirection to keep us all occupied while those of us who are still working do so from home. Trump’s open-by-Easter pledge may well be as quickly forgotten as his other lies during the coronavirus crisis thus far such as when he said that the cases would go down to near zero in a few days that the disease would simply disappear and that it would never make it to our shores in significant numbers.These daily Presidential briefings have understandably become controversial among the national media which is wary of being played by an attention-seeking President. Neither the Times nor the Washington Post is sending reporters to them citing the health risk. (A journalist who had attended several of the sessions has reportedly contracted the virus; even so the President refuses to follow the social-distancing dictates that his government is urging others to practice.) Sources at various television networks have said that the networks were considering no longer airing them although they have so far continued to do so. The Post columnist Margaret Sullivan has argued that the briefings should not be broadcast live anymore citing the fact that the President was using them as a platform for “self-aggrandizement” “media-bashing” and “exaggeration and outright lies.”Trump will keep doing them however because they work. According to the Times ratings for Trump’s briefings rival those for “hit reality shows and prime-time football.” Trump whose star turn on NBC’s “The Apprentice” arguably had as much to do with his election to the Presidency as anything else is obsessed with ratings. His other metrics are good too including a Gallup poll showing him with the highest approval rating of his Presidency (forty-nine per cent versus a forty-five per cent disapproval rating). Even more striking were the results of a CBS/YouGov poll released this week in which respondents were asked what sources of information about the coronavirus they found most credible. Democrats rated medical professionals and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention most highly. Trump came in last among this group at fourteen per cent. But for Republicans Trump came in at the top with ninety per cent saying that they trusted the President’s information about the coronavirus making him tied for first place with medical professionals. The poll shows that even when their own lives are literally at stake a significant subset of the American population no longer believes in almost anything other than the President.This in the end is why Trump’s nightly Follies matter. Even if he cannot reopen the country by Easter and governors and mayors ignore him as they surely will. Even if what he says is so contradictory and at times patently false that his own followers could not possibly heed his advice as a practical guide to action.In the long course of the Vietnam War which lasted a full decade some fifty-eight thousand Americans died. With the pandemic many scientific models publicized in recent days have projected that U.S. deaths could reach far beyond that figure by the time the coronavirus has run its course depending at least in part on what decisions Trump and other leaders make in the coming months. But this week’s Follies have shown an irresolute leader who does not want to fight the war or even on many days admit that it exists. He is a cartoon caricature of a wartime President not a real one.A Vietnam draft-dodger who used a phony foot problem to get out of that war Trump this week has reminded us that he would like to be a coronavirus draft-dodger too. But the fight is not a hoax no matter how often he suggests it is and the President like it or not is already in the fight. On Tuesday he told the country that he would soon be reopening it “as we near the end of our historic battle with the invisible enemy.” By the time you read this though the battle will not be over or even really begun. As soon as Trump finished speaking on Thursday CNN interrupted the briefing to broadcast the news that it had been the deadliest day yet in the pandemic for the United States with at least two hundred and thirty-seven dead and hours more to go.
506,From Bats to Human Lungs the Evolution of a Coronavirus,Carolyn Kormann,The New Yorker,-2,https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/from-bats-to-human-lungs-the-evolution-of-a-coronavirus,For thousands of years a parasite with no name lived happily among horseshoe bats in southern China. The bats had evolved to the point that they did not notice; they went about their nightly flights unbothered. One day the parasite—an ancestor of the coronavirus sars-CoV-2—had an opportunity to expand its realm. Perhaps it was a pangolin the scaly anteater an endangered species that is a victim of incessant wildlife trafficking and sold often secretly in live-animal markets throughout Southeast Asia and China. Or not. The genetic pathway remains unclear. But to survive in a new species whatever it was the virus had to mutate dramatically. It might even have taken a segment of a different coronavirus strain that already inhabited its new host and morphed into a hybrid—a better stronger version of itself a pathogenic Everyman capable of thriving in diverse species. More recently the coronavirus found a new species: ours. Perhaps a weary traveller rubbed his eyes or scratched his nose or was anxiously unconsciously biting his fingernails. One tiny invisible blob of virus. One human face. And here we are battling a global pandemic.The world’s confirmed cases (those with a positive lab test for covid-19 the disease caused by sars-CoV-2) doubled in seven days from nearly two hundred and thirteen thousand on March 19th to four hundred and sixty-seven thousand on March 26th. Nearly twenty-one thousand people have died. The United States now has more confirmed cases than any country on earth with more than eighty thousand on March 26th. These numbers are a fraction of the real unknown total in this country and around the world and the numbers will keep going up. Scientists behind a new study published earlier this month in the journal Science have found that for every confirmed case there are likely five to ten more people in the community with an undetected infection. This will likely remain the case. “The testing is not near adequate” one of the study’s authors Jeffrey Shaman an environmental-health sciences professor at Columbia University said. Comments from emergency-room doctors have been circulating on social media like S.O.S. flares. One from Daniele Macchini a doctor in Bergamo north of Milan described the situation as a “tsunami that has overwhelmed us.”Scientists first discovered that coronaviruses originate among bats following the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (sars) in 2003. Jonathan Epstein an epidemiologist at the EcoHealth Alliance in New York who studies zoonotic viruses—those that can jump from animals to people—was part of a research team that went hunting for the source in China’s Guangdong Province where simultaneous sars outbreaks had occurred suggesting multiple spillovers from animals to people. At first health officials believed palm civets a mongoose-like species commonly eaten in parts of China were responsible as they were widely sold at markets connected to the sars outbreak and tested positive for the virus. But civets bred elsewhere in Guangdong had no antibodies for the virus indicating that the market animals were only an intermediary highly infectious host. Epstein and others suspected that bats which are ubiquitous in the area’s rural agricultural hills and were at the time also sold from cages at Guangdong’s wet markets might be the coronavirus’s natural reservoir.The researchers travelled through the countryside setting up field labs inside limestone caverns and taking swabs from dozens of bats through the night. After months of investigation Epstein’s team discovered four species of horseshoe bats that carried coronaviruses similar to sars one of which carried a coronavirus that was genetically a more than ninety per cent match. “They were found in all of the locations where sars clusters were happening” he said.After years of further bat surveillance researchers eventually found the direct coronavirus antecedent to sars as well as hundreds of other coronaviruses circulating among some of the fourteen hundred bats species that live on six continents. Coronaviruses and other virus families it turns out have been co-evolving with bats for the entire span of human civilization and possibly much longer. As the coronavirus family grows different strains simultaneously co-infect individual bats turning their little bodies into virus blenders creating new strains of every sort some more powerful than others. This process happens without making bats sick—a phenomenon that scientists have linked to bats’ singular ability among mammals to fly. The feat takes a severe toll such that their immune systems have evolved a better way to repair cell damage and to fight off viruses without provoking further inflammation. But when these viruses leap into a new species—whether a pangolin or a civet or a human—the result can be severe sometimes deadly sickness.In 2013 Epstein’s main collaborator in China Shi Zheng-Li sequenced a coronavirus found in bats which in January she discovered shares ninety-six per cent of its genome with sars-CoV-2. The two viruses have a common ancestor that dates back thirty to fifty years but the absence of a perfect match suggests that further mutation took place in other bat colonies and then in an intermediate host. When forty-one severe cases of pneumonia were first announced in Wuhan in December many of them were connected to a wet market with a notorious wildlife section. Animals are stacked in cages—rabbits on top of civets on top of ferret-badgers. “That’s just a gravitational exchange of fecal matter and viruses” Epstein said. Chinese authorities reported that they tested animals at the market—all of which came back negative—but they have not specified which animals they tested information that is crucial for Epstein’s detective work. Authorities later found the virus in samples taken from the market’s tables and gutters. But because not all of the first patients were tied to the market nor were they connected to one another Epstein said “it raised the question of well perhaps those forty-one weren’t the first cases.”Analyses of the sars-CoV-2 genome indicate a single spillover event meaning the virus jumped only once from an animal to a person which makes it likely that the virus was circulating among people before December. Unless more information about the animals at the Wuhan market is released the transmission chain may never be clear. There are however numerous possibilities. A bat hunter or a wildlife trafficker might have brought the virus to the market. Pangolins happen to carry a coronavirus which they might have picked up from bats years ago and which is in one crucial part of its genome virtually identical to sars-CoV-2. But no one has yet found evidence that pangolins were at the Wuhan market or even that venders there trafficked pangolins. “We’ve created circumstances in our world somehow that allows for these viruses which would otherwise not be known to cause any problems to get into human populations” Mark Denison the director of pediatric infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center’s Institute for Infection Immunology and Inflammation told me. “And this one happened to say ‘I really like it here.’ ”Bar graph of how long the virus lingers on a surfaceAccording to researchers at Rocky Mountain Laboratories some viral particles remain viable up to four hours on copper twenty-four hours on cardboard and seventy-two hours on plastic and stainless steel though the number of viable particles begins to decrease within minutes.The new coronavirus is an elusive killer. Since people have never seen this strain before there is much about it that remains a mystery. But in just the past few weeks genetic sleuthing atomic-level imaging computer modelling and prior research on other types of coronaviruses including sars and mers (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) have helped researchers to quickly learn an extraordinary amount—particularly what might treat or eradicate it through social-distancing measures antiviral drugs and eventually a vaccine. Since January nearly eight hundred papers about the virus have been posted on BIORxiv a preprint server for studies that have not yet been peer-reviewed. More than a thousand coronavirus genome sequences from different cases around the world have been shared in public databases. “It’s insane” Kristian Andersen a professor in the Department of Immunology and Microbiology at Scripps Research told me. “Almost the entire scientific field is focussed on this virus now. We’re talking about a warlike situation.”There are endless viruses in our midst made either of RNA or DNA. DNA viruses which exist in much greater abundance around the planet are capable of causing systemic diseases that are endemic latent and persistent—like the herpes viruses (which includes chicken pox) hepatitis B and the papilloma viruses that cause cancer. “DNA viruses are the ones that live with us and stay with us” Denison said. “They’re lifelong.” Retroviruses like H.I.V. have RNA in their genomes but behave like DNA viruses in the host. RNA viruses on the other hand have simpler structures and mutate rapidly. “Viruses mutate quickly and they can retain advantageous traits” Epstein told me. “A virus that’s more promiscuous more generalist that can inhabit and propagate in lots of other hosts ultimately has a better chance of surviving.” They also tend to cause epidemics—such as measles Ebola Zika and a raft of respiratory infections including influenza and coronaviruses. Paul Turner a Rachel Carson professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale University told me “They’re the ones that surprise us the most and do the most damage.”Scientists discovered the coronavirus family in the nineteen-fifties while peering through early electron microscopes at samples taken from chickens suffering from infectious bronchitis. The coronavirus’s RNA its genetic code is swathed in three different kinds of proteins one of which decorates the virus’s surface with mushroom-like spikes giving the virus the eponymous appearance of a crown. Scientists found other coronaviruses that caused disease in pigs and cows and then in the mid-nineteen-sixties two more that caused a common cold in people. (Later widespread screening identified two more human coronaviruses responsible for colds.) These four common-cold viruses might have come long ago from animals but they are now entirely human viruses responsible for fifteen to thirty per cent of the seasonal colds in a given year. We are their natural reservoir just as bats are the natural reservoir for hundreds of other coronaviruses. But since they did not seem to cause severe disease they were mostly ignored. In 2003 a conference for nidovirales (the taxonomic order under which coronaviruses fall) was nearly cancelled due to lack of interest. Then sars emerged leaping from bats to civets to people. The conference sold out.sars is closely related to the new virus we currently face. Whereas common-cold coronaviruses tend to infect only the upper respiratory tract (mainly the nose and throat) making them highly contagious sars primarily infects the lower respiratory system (the lungs) and therefore causes a much more lethal disease with a fatality rate of approximately ten per cent. (mers which emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and was transmitted from bats to camels to people also caused severe disease in the lower respiratory system with a thirty-seven per cent fatality rate.) sars-CoV-2 behaves like a monstrous mutant hybrid of all the human coronaviruses that came before it. It can infect and replicate throughout our airways. “That’s why it is so bad” Stanley Perlman a professor of microbiology and immunology who has been studying coronaviruses for more than three decades told me. “It has the lower-respiratory severity of sars and mers coronaviruses and the transmissibility of cold coronaviruses.”VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKERComparing the Influenza Epidemic of 1918 to the CoronavirusOne reason that sars-CoV-2 may be so versatile and therefore so successful has to do with its particular talent for binding and fusing with lung cells. All coronaviruses use their spike proteins to gain entry to human cells through a complex multistep process. First if one imagines the spike’s mushroom shape the cap acts like a molecular key fitting into our cells’ locks. Scientists call these locks receptors. In sars-CoV-2 the cap binds perfectly to a receptor called the ACE-2 which can be found in various parts of the human body including the lungs and kidney cells. Coronaviruses attack the respiratory system because their ACE-2 receptors are so accessible to the outside world. “The virus just hops in” Perlman told me “whereas it’s not easy to get to the kidney.”While the first sars virus attached to the ACE-2 receptor as well sars-CoV-2 binds to it ten times more efficiently Kizzmekia Corbett the scientific lead of the coronavirus program the National Institutes of Health Vaccine Research Center told me. “The binding is tighter which could potentially mean that the beginning of the infection process is just more efficient.” sars-CoV-2 also seems to have a unique ability which sars and mers did not have to use enzymes from our human tissue—including one widely available in our bodies named furin—to sever the spike protein’s cap from its stem. Only then can the stem fuse the virus membrane and the human-cell membrane together allowing the virus to spit its RNA into the cell. According to Lisa Gralinski an assistant professor in the Department of Epidemiology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill this supercharged ability to bind to the ACE-2 receptor and to use human enzymes to activate fusion “could aid a lot in the transmissibility of this new virus and in seeding infections at a higher level.”When most RNA viruses replicate themselves in a host the process is quick and dirty as they have no proofreading mechanism. This can lead to frequent and random mutations. “But the vast majority of those mutations just kill the virus immediately” Andersen told me. Unlike other RNA viruses however coronaviruses do have some capacity to check for errors when they replicate. “They have an enzyme that actually corrects mistakes” Denison told me. It was his lab at Vanderbilt that first confirmed in experiments on live viruses the existence of this enzyme which makes coronaviruses in a sense cunning mutators. The viruses can remain stable in a host when there is no selective pressure to change but rapidly evolve when necessary. Each time they leap into a new species for example they are able to hastily transform in order to survive in the new environment with its new physiology and a new immune system to battle. Once the virus is spreading easily within a species though its attitude is “I’m happy I’m good no need to change” Denison said. That seems to be playing out now in humans; as sars-CoV-2 circles the globe there are slight variations among its strains but none of them seem to affect the virus’s behavior. “This is not a virus that is rapidly adapting. It’s like the best car in the Indy 500. It’s out in front and there is no obstacle in its path. So there is no benefit to changing that car.”The coronavirus binds to host cells and fuses with the cell’s membrane releasing its viral genome and hijacking the cell’s machinery to duplicate its RNA and create new viral proteins. The RNA and proteins are packaged into new virus particles which are excreted from the cell to infect more cells.Once a coronavirus enters a person—lodging itself in the upper respiratory system and hijacking the cell’s hardware—it rapidly replicates. A virus replicates in order to shed from its host—through mucus snot phlegm and even our breath—as soon as possible in great quantities so that it can keep spreading. The coronavirus happens to be a brilliant shedder. A preprint study by German researchers published earlier this month and one of the first outside China to examine data from patients diagnosed with covid-19 found clear evidence that infected people shed the coronavirus at significant rates before they develop symptoms. In effect—possibly due to that supercharged ability to bind and fuse to our cells—the virus wears an invisibility cloak. Scientists recently estimated that undocumented cases of covid-19 or infected people with mild symptoms are fifty-five per cent as contagious as severe cases. Another study found that in more severe cases (requiring hospitalization) patients shed the virus from their respiratory tracts for as long as thirty-seven days.Outside a host in parasitical purgatory a virus is inert not quite alive but not dead either. A hundred million coronavirus particles could fit on the head of a pin—typically thousands or tens of thousands are necessary to infect an animal or a person—and they might remain viable for long stretches. Researchers at the Virus Ecology Unit of Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Montana a facility connected to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases have found that the virus can linger on copper for four hours on a piece of cardboard for twenty-four hours and on plastic or stainless steel for as long as three days. They also found that the virus can survive for three hours floating through the air transmitted by the tiny respiratory droplets an infected person exhales sneezes or coughs out. (Other research suggests the virus might be able to exist as an aerosol but only in very limited conditions.) Most virus particles though seem to lose their virulency fairly quickly. The infection window is highest in the first ten minutes. Still the risk of infection has turned many of us understandably into germophobes.Human anatomy of the virus entering and infecting.The coronavirus enters the body through the mouth eyes and nose then makes its way to the lungs where particles replicate. It is primarily transmitted to others through coughing and sneezing.All a virus wants is an endless chain of hosts. Contagion is the evolutionary end goal. Based on experiments so far researchers estimate that covid-19 is slightly more communicable than the common flu and less communicable than the most highly infectious viruses like measles with which a single sick person can infect around twelve other people. There are likely coronavirus super-spreaders—people who for whatever reason are almost entirely asymptomatic but transmit the disease to many other people. But pinning down an exact infection rate at this point is an impossible task. “We tend to focus on these absolute numbers as telling us how worried we should be” Denison said. “Look it’s like flooding. You know is it up to my knees or is it up to my chin? It doesn’t matter. I need to do something to try to make sure I’m not gonna drive my car into the flood.”In many places we already have driven into the flood. As hundreds of people die each day hospitals are running out of supplies beds and ventilators. In these severe covid-19 cases according to scientists’ current understanding the disease may have more to do with a haywire immune response to the virus than anything else. Because the virus can gain a foothold in our lower respiratory system while still wearing that invisibility cloak it “basically beats the immune system to the punch and starts replicating too rapidly” Perlman said. When the immune system finally does register its presence it might go into overdrive and send everything in its arsenal to attack since it has no specific antibodies to fight these strange new invaders. “It’s like pouring gas on the fire” Denison told me. The lung tissue swells and fills with fluid. Breathing is restricted as is the exchange of oxygen. “The host immune response just gets triggered to such an extreme level and then builds on itself and builds on itself until ultimately the body kind of goes into shock” Gralinski said. It is almost like an autoimmune disease; the immune system is attacking parts of the body that it should not.This type of response might be why the elderly are on the whole more vulnerable to covid-19 just as they were to the sars outbreak in 2003. (In that outbreak there were almost no deaths among children under the age of thirteen and when kids did get sick the disease was on average milder than what affected adults.) When studying sars in mice models Denison told me that he has observed a phenomenon known as “immune senescence” in which older mice no longer had the capacity to respond in a balanced way to a new virus; their immune systems’ overreaction then caused even more severe disease. This occurred in some of the worst cases during the first sars outbreak too Denison said and explains why antiviral drugs may be significantly more helpful at the onset of illness before the immune system has had a chance to wreak havoc.In the last decade Denison’s lab and collaborators at the University of North Carolina have been researching antiviral treatments to try to find something that worked not just against sars and mers but for a new coronavirus which they knew would inevitably arrive. Together they did much of the early research into the drug now known as Remdesivir which is currently in development by Gilead and in studies on infected patients and another antiviral drug compound known as NHC. Both drugs in animal models were able to bypass avoid or block the coronavirus’s proofreading function which helped stop the virus from replicating successfully in the body. “They worked very effectively against all the coronaviruses that we’ve tested” Denison told me.Coronaviruses likely have that proofreading enzyme because they are huge—one of the largest RNA viruses in existence—and they need a mechanism that maintains such a long genome’s structure. From our perspective the benefit of such a big genome Andersen told me “is that the more genes and protein products a virus has the more opportunities we have to design specific treatments against them.” For instance the virus’s unique ability to use the human enzyme furin offers promise for antiviral drugs that act as furin inhibitors.covid-19 while still new to us hosts will continue to be responsible for widespread infection and death. But Epstein said “Over time as viruses evolve with their natural habitats they tend to cause less severe disease. And that is good for both the host and the virus.” The more virulent strains might burn out (which however means many more awful deaths) while the remaining hosts might build up some immunity. More immediately and urgently the virus’s stability—how much it is thriving among us right now and mutating only minimally—bodes well for the performance of antiviral drugs and eventually a vaccine. If the growing number of mitigation measures—this unprecedented national and international shutdown—are held in place for enough time the speed at which the virus is spreading should slow giving hospitals and health workers some relief. “The virus is our teacher” Denison told me. It has spent thousands of years evolving to get where it is. We’re now just rushing to catch up.
507,The Trials of a Never Trump Republican,Susan B. Glasser,The New Yorker,-2,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/30/the-trials-of-a-never-trump-republican,"For four years, Sarah Longwell has been hoping for Donald Trump’s downfall. But nothing has triggered it. Not the Mueller investigation into his dealings with Russia. Not his coverup of hush-money payments to a porn star, or the profiting from his office to benefit his personal businesses. Not even a Ukraine extortion scheme that resulted in just the third impeachment and trial of a President in history. He has proved immune to every scandal. Will the coronavirus pandemic be any different?I spoke to Longwell on March 13th, barely an hour after Trump declared a “national emergency” to combat a once-in-a-century outbreak that he had spent the previous few weeks claiming to have completely under control. Pundits were already calling Trump’s botched initial handling of the crisis “the end of his Presidency.” Longwell, a forty-year-old conservative Republican who has spent the Trump years in an increasingly isolated fight within her party to end his Presidency, was not yet convinced. “How many times have we seen that headline before?” she asked.Longwell is a Never Trumper, one of the stubborn tribe of Republicans who have refused to accept the President as their leader. In 2016, virtually the entire Republican Party opposed Trump in the primaries, but since his Inauguration only a shrinking group has persisted in publicly taking him on.To Donald Trump, the members of this small but highly visible resistance are his real enemy, even more than the opposition party. He often tweets his contempt; one day last fall, he described them as politically weakened and “on respirators,” but nonetheless “worse and more dangerous for our country” than the Democrats. Trump concluded with a furious flourish: “Watch out for them, they are human scum!”Longwell embodies Trump’s darkest anxieties. Relentless in her loathing of the forty-fifth President, she has turned her Never Trump-ism from a passion project into a full-time profession. Starting last September, as Trump faced impeachment by the House of Representatives and a trial in the Senate, Longwell raised and spent millions of dollars on ads advocating his removal from office. After his acquittal, she launched a new effort, raising several million dollars in a matter of weeks to turn out “disaffected Republicans” in the Democratic primaries, a first step toward building a “coalition of the center” to defeat the President in November.“For health and safety reasons, we’ll be transitioning to cyber crime.”Cartoon by Paul NothLongwell sees Trump’s failure to respond early and decisively to the coronavirus as a case study in “the crisis of leadership” that she has warned fellow-Republicans about. She believes the new political reality of the pandemic moment is deeply problematic for Trump and for the Party leaders who have so fervently embraced him. As Trump was denying that the virus would afflict the country, millions of suburban voters—including many Republican women like Longwell—were helping former Vice-President Joe Biden take a commanding lead in the Democratic primaries over Bernie Sanders. She hopes now that Biden can be the instrument of Trump’s defeat, enabling a “restoration” of the America she still believes in. Longwell told me that, for the Republican establishment, which has for all intents and purposes fully sold out to Trump, “this is their worst-case scenario.”Alifelong conservative, Longwell grew up in a Republican family and town in central Pennsylvania and began following politics in high school, during the impeachment, in 1998, of Bill Clinton. In her eyes, Clinton was a “dirtbag” for having an affair with a former intern who was not much older than she was. After graduating from Kenyon College, in Ohio, in 2002, she went to work for a conservative group, the Intercollegiate Studies Institute, in Delaware. She soon found herself promoting a book for “intellectuals who find Darwinism unconvincing” and went on tour with Senator Rick Santorum to help sell his book “It Takes a Family,” whose retrograde views led a reviewer for the Philadelphia Inquirer to describe it as the product of “one of the finest minds of the thirteenth century.” At the time, Longwell was coming out to her friends and family as a lesbian. She decided that she could no longer work at such an organization with someone she considered “the most visibly anti-gay politician in the country,” and she quit.Still deeply conservative, she moved to Washington in 2005, and was hired by Richard Berman as a junior staffer at his communications firm. Berman, a legendary Republican lobbyist turned P.R. man, specialized in helping food and beverage companies by setting up industry front groups to fight regulatory efforts. Longwell loved the work, and in the course of fifteen years she rose to become senior vice-president and was in line to run the company. Together, they opposed everything from raising the minimum wage to stricter drunk-driving laws. “Sarah always had a knife in her teeth,” Berman told me.Early in her time at the firm, Longwell persuaded Berman to agree to be interviewed by “60 Minutes.” The story portrayed Berman as the “Dr. Evil” of the Washington influence game, willing, on behalf of a range of undisclosed corporate clients, to attack workers, healthy-eating proponents, and even activists for Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Berman still has a link to the “60 Minutes” episode on the firm’s Web site, accompanied by a quote calling him “the industry’s weapon of mass destruction.” He keeps a “Dr. Evil” nameplate on his desk. “If they call you Mr. Nice Guy, would that be better?” Berman told me. “I don’t think so.”Berman taught Longwell to discredit the opposition before it discredits you; to be edgy, memorable, and funny; and to always play offense, because, as Longwell put it in a 2014 presentation, “defense over time loses.” He devised an acronym for the firm’s approach to “managing” public opinion: flags, for fear, love, anger, greed, and sympathy. Of those, he told me, fear and anger are the most effective: “Nobody likes negative ads, but everybody remembers them. I absolutely believe it.”Longwell readily acknowledged that Berman was “almost like a bogeyman” to opponents. But she admired him. “Rick is the kind of person who is, like, ‘I will stand up, I will say what I think, and I will defend my positions.’ I believe that, too,” she said. “I believe that, if you are opposed to this President, there are so many people in this town, so many people in Congress, they want to say, ‘I think he’s terrible,’ whatever. They won’t say it out loud. I think that Rick helped me understand how to have the courage not just to say what I believe but, when people come at you for that, to say, ‘Well, this is who I am, this is what I believe.’ ”The experience of being a lesbian in conservative circles also taught Longwell the virtues of plain speaking. An advocate for marriage equality despite the Republican Party’s stance against it, she married her girlfriend in 2013. “I got comfortable with everyone being mad at you,” she said. “To be a gay Republican was to recognize that Republicans were going to dislike you because you were gay, and Democrats were going to dislike you for being Republican, and you had to walk your path because you felt like it was the right thing to do.”In 2016, Longwell opposed Trump in the Republican primaries but recognized the potency of his fear-and-anger platform. How could she not? It was as if he were working from Berman’s playbook. During the campaign, Longwell happened to be the incoming board chair of the Log Cabin Republicans; she was the first woman to hold the post since the group was founded, in the late seventies, to advocate for gay and lesbian Republicans. The board felt intense pressure to endorse Trump, despite his selection of Mike Pence, an openly homophobic evangelical Christian, as his running mate. Longwell told me that she “basically lay on the tracks” to stop the group from backing Trump. Mostly, though, she watched the election unfold with dismay.“For me, the world changed in 2016,” Longwell said. That summer, her first son was born. “My wife’s water broke the night of Melania’s speech at the Convention,” and a few nights later, after their son’s birth, she watched on television at the hospital as Trump accepted the Republican nomination. “I remember just how bad he made me feel,” she said. “That’s what I remember. I remember holding a new baby and feeling like this can’t be what’s happening.” On Election Night, she was at a party in Washington, texting with another anti-Trump operative, Tim Miller, the former spokesperson for Jeb Bush’s short-lived Presidential campaign. “He’s going to win,” Miller wrote to her. As the news sank in, she went outside and bummed a cigarette, although she no longer smoked.Many people who opposed Trump in 2016 have their version of this story: the Election Night disbelief and shock, the litany of outrages that followed. But, unlike many others in Republican Washington, Longwell did not make her accommodations, political and moral, with the new President. When, on his second weekend in office, Trump issued an executive order banning entry into the U.S. for citizens of seven majority-Muslim nations, Longwell decided that Trump really was a danger to the country. “I started thinking about: What can I do?” she recalled. “How can I get involved?”In the fall of 2017, Longwell was invited to a session of the Meeting of the Concerned, a semi-secret group of disaffected Republicans that had started gathering every other Tuesday in a basement conference room near Capitol Hill. The Never Trumpers were hardly a real movement, less an organized cabal than a cable-news-savvy alliance. Among them were longtime Party operatives, such as Steve Schmidt and Rick Wilson, who became regulars on liberal-leaning TV shows, and public intellectuals, such as Eliot Cohen, a former Bush Administration official who now teaches at Johns Hopkins University, and Max Boot, of the Council on Foreign Relations, who stopped writing for the Wall Street Journal’s increasingly pro-Trump editorial page and went to the Washington Post. With the exception of Senator John McCain, most Republican elected officials already either supported Trump or kept their mouths shut about him. Inside the Administration, some had qualms about the President, but they soon were fired or marginalized, or quit. The official Party apparatus had been taken over by the President, and Republican lobbyists, consultants, political operatives, congressional staffers, right-wing media commentators, and government job seekers quickly identified where their interests lay.Jerry Taylor, who helped found the Meeting of the Concerned and the Niskanen Center, the think tank that hosts it, told me about the first time Longwell showed up. “Sarah didn’t know anyone in the group,” he said. “She had never really travelled in those circles before.” Many of the attendees were well-known denizens of Washington’s TV greenrooms, who bonded over their disillusionment with the Party and saw “the election of Donald Trump as just the thin blue line between us and the abyss,” as Taylor put it. Longwell wanted more than this talky self-styled resistance. She told me, “Everybody was sitting around having a conversation that I had heard lots of versions of at that point, which is: What happened to the Republican Party?” When Bill Kristol, a Republican pundit and the founder of The Weekly Standard, spoke up, Longwell recalled, she interrupted him: “ ‘Why don’t we do something about it?’ And he was kind of, like, ‘Well, what would we do?’ And I was, like, ‘I don’t know, but you’re famous. You’re Bill Kristol.’ ”me. “Sarah agreed.”In February, 2018, as Trump was publicly attacking Mueller, Longwell set up Defending Democracy Together, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit that could accept donations without having to disclose donors. Defending Democracy Together became the umbrella organization for Republicans for the Rule of Law and other like-minded projects that sought to combat Trump’s policies. Longwell and Kristol worked his contacts and raised substantial sums of money, including from liberal donors such as Pierre Omidyar, the tech billionaire who funds the left-wing Web site the Intercept.Starting that March, whenever Trump threatened Mueller or opened a new front in his fight against the Russia “hoax,” the group ran TV ads defending the investigation, many of them featuring quickly produced clips of news footage or Trump’s latest tweet, with urgent pleas to members of Congress to stop the President. All told, before the Mueller investigation was over, Republicans for the Rule of Law had run more than a hundred ads, aimed at a narrow but important segment of “persuadable Republicans” in key states, seeking to convince Party leaders that even Trump’s base would not go along with his firing of the special counsel. In the hope of getting directly to the President, Longwell also ran the ads in Washington on Fox News, which Trump watches addictively.In 2018, at a session of the Meeting of the Concerned, Longwell met George Conway, the husband of Trump’s White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway. A prominent conservative attorney, he had accepted, then declined, a senior position in Trump’s Justice Department. Earlier that year, Conway had started tweeting his dismay about Trump, thus setting off a marital-political drama worthy of a reality-TV Presidency. Like Longwell, Conway was invited into the capital’s Never Trump circle, but he, too, decided that the meetings were often frustrating exercises in “therapy.” He craved action. (“Look, there’s a lot of benefit just to catharsis,” Jerry Taylor joked to me, “especially given that the alternative is to become an alcoholic, which is easy to do in this town now.”)In November, 2018, as Trump attacked Justice Department norms and practices, Longwell helped Conway file the paperwork to start Checks and Balances, an anti-Trump group for conservative-minded lawyers, to counter the influential Federalist Society. It débuted with a splash, given the Conways’ public split over Trump. Longwell was fast becoming the organizational heft behind the Never Trump movement. “Basically, if you want to set up a group,” Conway told me, “she’s the person who makes it.”Although Conway was constantly in the news with his tweets whacking his wife’s boss, more and more of Longwell’s Republican connections were being converted to Trumpism—deleting old Twitter posts critical of the President, making discreet job inquiries. By the second year of the Administration, she saw two kinds of Republicans in Washington: “the people who became Always Trumpers” and the group she called “the Anti-Anti-Trumpers, the people who were, like, ‘Well, I’m not for Trump, but you guys are ridiculous, you guys have Trump Derangement Syndrome.’ ” Republicans she had been friendly with for years and who had been “vociferously” anti-Trump in 2016 now bashed her and other Never Trumpers on Twitter.Kristol’s Weekly Standard remained strongly anti-Trump, and by late 2018 he was struggling to keep it alive. When the magazine’s owner, the conservative billionaire Philip Anschutz, threatened to shut it down, James Murdoch, the estranged son of its initial backer, Rupert Murdoch, approached Anschutz about buying it. But Anschutz refused to sell, and abruptly forced the Standard to cease operations, transferring its assets to another property he owned, the Washington Examiner. Kristol assembled a small new team to run a Never Trumper Web site, called the Bulwark, which launched a month later. Longwell, with no previous experience in the media business, became its publisher.James Murdoch was not able to save the Standard, but Kristol introduced Longwell to Murdoch’s wife, Kathryn, and she became a major, six-figure donor to Republicans for the Rule of Law. Kathryn Murdoch told me, “Sarah gives me hope that there is going to be a post-Trump Republican Party that is principled and focussed on getting things done.” Murdoch, who described herself as an independent, added, “Unfortunately, one of the most frustrating things right now is there’s a big difference between the way Republican leaders speak behind closed doors and the way they speak in public.”Longwell and Kristol spent much of 2018 and the first half of 2019 trying to recruit a Republican to run against Trump in the upcoming primaries. At first, Longwell hoped for a big-name candidate: “I was, like, ‘Maybe Mitt Romney’ll do it, maybe Condoleezza Rice will do it.’ And I subsequently realized that there really was a very narrow universe of people who were going to legitimately consider it. At the end of the day, none of them saw a path.” John Kasich, the former Ohio governor, who ran against Trump in 2016, was interested, but even longtime financial supporters wouldn’t back him. Longwell’s “personal favorite” was Larry Hogan, the governor of Maryland, whose father had been the first Republican member of the House Judiciary Committee to call for Richard Nixon’s impeachment. But, last spring, Hogan said that he wouldn’t mount a “suicide mission” against the President. “Nobody wanted to cross this guy,” Longwell recalled. “This American Life” compared her effort to that of the workers who tried to stop the meltdown at Chernobyl. And yet, Longwell noted, “it was easier to get three guys to go into Chernobyl than it was to get somebody to run against Trump.”By the summer of 2019, not even the Log Cabin Republicans wanted to oppose Trump anymore. Longwell found that her activism against the President was at odds with the majority of the board, and in August she resigned as chair. As soon as she did, the board voted to preëmptively endorse Trump for 2020. A half-dozen other board members ultimately quit in the rift over Trump, as did the group’s first female executive director. Jennifer Horn, the former chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party, who had been recruited to the board by Longwell, told me, “We just could not remain.”By this point, Longwell had become all too familiar with what she often called “the soft bigotry of low expectations”: the assumption that her fellow-Republicans would give in to Trump, whatever his latest outrage, and yet escape censure, since their capitulation was now merely the expected outcome. The impeachment drama, ignited by the disclosure, in September, of Trump’s fateful call to the Ukrainian President, seemed as if it would provide yet more proof of this frustrating new Washington reality.Despite the revelations about Trump’s scheme to withhold U.S. military aid to Ukraine as he demanded politically beneficial investigations into Biden, Longwell knew that impeachment was almost certain to end with an acquittal in the Republican-controlled Senate. There were not twenty Republican votes to convict, and likely never would be. Still, on September 30th, less than a week after the House inquiry began, she wrote an opinion piece for NBC comparing the moment to Watergate, titled “Republicans Who Back Impeachment Can Save the Country—and the GOP.” That day, she got an e-mail from Rick Berman, her boss, asking where she stood on impeachment. She replied that it was time for them to talk.They met in his sunny corner office, and Berman made it clear that Longwell would have to choose between supporting Trump’s impeachment and staying on at his company. Berman had allowed her to devote increasing time to anti-Trump causes during the previous few years, to the point of even raising money and working to recruit a primary candidate against him. But Berman could not abide her using his firm to run a campaign to remove a President of their party. “My red line was impeachment,” he told me. They agreed that by the end of the year she would leave Berman’s company and start her own political consulting firm, Longwell Partners.Longwell said that her views had “changed a lot” since she first began working with Berman, but she still shared his hard-edged approach to political combat. “Rick really taught me everything,” she told me. “If you don’t engage people and try to persuade them, the other side will.”As the impeachment proceedings began, Republicans for the Rule of Law rolled out video ads that detailed with biting humor the latest developments in the Ukraine saga. One of Longwell’s staff members, Barry Rubin, started a Twitter account, focussing on the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, called Lindsey Graham’s Fake Conscience. Every day, he tweeted out old footage of Graham, now arguably Trump’s most reliable Senate cheerleader, from his previous incarnations as a Trump basher (in 2016) and as a House impeachment manager against Bill Clinton (in 1999). In one clip that went viral, Graham talked with great emotion about how much he admired Joe Biden, the “nicest person” in politics. Rubin posted it on November 21st, the day Graham’s committee began investigating Biden’s dealings with Ukraine, just as Trump had demanded. The tweet said, “whatever you do, do not watch the video below!! it will make me look like a monster.” It has been viewed more than one and a half million times.Still, it proved impossible to persuade Republicans to vote for impeachment. Longwell started out with a list of a few dozen House members who she thought might be persuaded to break with Trump. After one week of hearings, the list rapidly shrank. First to go was Elise Stefanik, a Harvard-educated junior member of the House Intelligence Committee, who sarcastically questioned witnesses and ranted about the Democratic-controlled process. “They just Trumpify themselves immediately,” Longwell said. Stefanik was soon doing prime-time interviews on Fox News with Sean Hannity and tweeting nasty nicknames at her 2020 opponent, a Democrat she disparaged as “Taxing Tedra.” Longwell likened the sudden shifts of Stefanik and others to “the Invasion of the Body Snatchers.”For as long as she had been fighting Trump, Longwell had been travelling home to central Pennsylvania, hoping to understand his appeal to Republicans. After the public impeachment hearings wrapped up, just before Thanksgiving, we drove two and a half hours from Washington to a storefront in New Cumberland, to find out if the base was fazed by the Ukraine scandal. Longwell grew up nearby, just outside Dillsburg, a small town of fewer than three thousand people. Her parents are lawyers (her father is retired) and still live there. Dillsburg is conservative and Republican, the kind of place where the local elementary school closes for the first day of deer-hunting season. It went overwhelmingly for Trump in 2016.Since the start of the Trump Presidency, Longwell has conducted regular focus groups of his voters from the area, trying to figure out what might move them to vote against him in 2020. The groups almost always comprise middle-class Republican women from the suburbs and exurbs—the most Trump-skeptical remaining part of the G.O.P., and the voters who may well decide the President’s fate in November. One Republican who has been in many meetings with Longwell was struck by the personal nature of her project. Longwell has often joked that she was secretly doing this to convince her “parents that they shouldn’t be supporting Trump,” the Republican told me. (Longwell was reluctant to discuss her parents, except to say that she didn’t ask her father if he had voted for Trump in 2016, “because I didn’t want to know.”)At first, the two focus groups that Longwell had convened for our visit seemed to suggest that the President was in more political trouble than we had realized. The groups—all women, all Trump voters with varying degrees of regret about him—started out identically: when the moderator asked how many thought the country was going in the right direction, not a single hand went up. The reason was their concern about the President. In the second group, a retired nurse said, “He has ability, but he’s also a narcissistic sociopath. And I voted for him! We all did.” (When she said this, Longwell exclaimed from where we were observing, behind a two-way mirror, “We have a George!”—as in George Conway, who had recently argued in The Atlantic that Trump has narcissistic personality disorder.) Others spoke of the “degradation of the office of President,” said that Trump was “just so full of hate,” and bemoaned his “flamboyant obnoxiousness.” Everyone said Trump’s Twitter feed was a problem.Two staffers from Longwell’s team who watched with us were encouraged, but she warned them to wait for “the turn.” It soon became clear what she meant: The women didn’t like Trump, but they didn’t like anyone else, either. They didn’t trust the media, and they thought other politicians were just as bad as the President. Although they could not explain the details of the Ukraine scandal—except for one woman who had become an obsessive MSNBC watcher—they thought impeachment was costly and pointless.Still, Longwell was not entirely discouraged. Trump had won Pennsylvania by only about forty thousand votes in 2016; he would need these women to vote for him again, and it was hard to imagine that all of them would do so. Before we left, the moderator asked the second group whether they would consider voting for a Democrat in 2020. Five of the nine said yes. “I’d vote for a dog over Trump,” one said. Then the moderator asked who they thought would win if Biden was the Democratic nominee. They all said Biden.Three weeks later, when the Democratic majority in the House impeached Trump, all of Longwell’s initial targets—among them Adam Kinzinger, of Illinois; Will Hurd, of Texas; and Francis Rooney, of Florida—voted no, along with every member of the Republican caucus.Longwell nevertheless kept her contrarian optimism, hoping that some new revelation could shift the political momentum in the upcoming Senate trial. “To me, the only thing that seemed like it could would be witnesses, hearing from people directly,” she said. In the focus groups in Pennsylvania, the women had been shown a series of impeachment-related ads, and panned all of them, except for one pressing Trump to agree to witnesses. (“What is Trump hiding?” it asked, showing pictures of his advisers with duct tape over their mouths.)Longwell planned to pressure Senate Republicans to summon witnesses whom Trump had blocked from testifying in the House. She was aware that others might consider her “naïve and quixotic,” or at least “annoyingly earnest,” but she was not ready to give up. “I’m like Charlie Brown with the football, right?—me thinking that these guys are going to stand up.”As the House was conducting its impeachment vote, which Kellyanne Conway dismissed as the result of Democrats’ “get-Donald-Trump obsession,” her husband and other Never Trumpers announced the creation of the Lincoln Project, a group aimed at punishing Trump’s “Republican enablers” in the Senate in the 2020 election. “There has to be some political price for putting party over country,” George Conway told me. Earlier in the fall, he had talked with Anthony Scaramucci—who had flamed out as Trump’s White House communications director after only eleven days and eventually became a biting critic of the President—about “ways to get under Trump’s skin.” Conway wanted to run TV ads targeted at the President that would feature an actor playing Trump’s disapproving father—an idea from the political strategist Rick Wilson. Scaramucci wanted them to start a political-action committee. Instead, they created the Lincoln Project with an array of consultants who had worked on Republican Presidential campaigns, including Wilson and Steve Schmidt, as well as Jennifer Horn, who had served on the Log Cabin board with Longwell.The new group ran scorching impeachment-related ads against Republican senators seeking reëlection in key swing states. It also touted, on its Web site, a comment by Trump’s former strategist Steve Bannon, which underscored Trump’s vulnerability. “We need the Republican establishment on board,” Bannon told the Associated Press in January, noting Trump’s narrow victories in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, the states that sealed his Electoral College win. “If these guys can peel off three or four per cent, that’s going to be serious.”This was also Longwell’s theory about 2020, and the reason for her focus groups. She didn’t need to convert every Republican in the room, just a few of them. Longwell planned to assemble a database of disaffected Republicans and give them “permission structures” to vote for a Democrat. She already knew who they were: the audience of her Never Trump groups; the readers of the Bulwark, which receives about two million unique visitors a month and has had eleven million downloads of its podcast in the past year; and the more than three hundred thousand people who had signed petitions circulated by Republicans for the Rule of Law.But as she watched the Democratic Presidential race unfold, with its faltering front-runner and disjointed debates, Longwell became increasingly discouraged. For Republicans like her, the 2020 Democrats ranged from uninspiring (Biden) to terrifying (Sanders). Republican elected officials, meanwhile, seemed to be even more vocally pro-Trump than before impeachment. When Longwell and I returned to Pennsylvania in January for more focus groups, the women were still leery of Trump and the direction of the country, but this time the conversation was dominated by the most pro-Trump woman in the room. Sounding like a Fox News host on a roll, she said, “I think they hate him so bad because he threatens their liberal agenda. They want to get rid of him any way they can.”At this point, Longwell abruptly stepped out from behind the mirror and interrupted the focus group. “I’m from Dillsburg,” Longwell told them. “I’ve been a Republican my entire life.” Then she launched into a speech. “I’ve become persuaded that President Trump is very bad for the Republican Party, including the fact that he should be impeached,” she said. She talked about the dangers of an out-of-control executive, the future of the Republican Party, and the hypocrisy of senators who claimed to believe in the rule of law for everyone except Trump.Longwell seemed to want to convince someone, anyone, even a dozen suburban moms munching chips in a focus group on a Wednesday night. “I really believe character counts in a President,” she said, “and I can tell you do as well.” But, while most of the women did not love Trump, they did not really care about him, either, and Longwell did. The last word went to the President’s most ardent backer. “I think Trump is the one who could bring us together if Democrats would stop fighting him so hard,” she told Longwell. “He has to have been one of the most influential politicians of all time.”Afew weeks later, on Friday, January 31st, Longwell and I met in her bright new office, overlooking McPherson Square, in Washington. The night before, Senator Lamar Alexander had put an end to the infuriating charade of a Senate trial, announcing that he would oppose the Democrats’ effort to force the Senate to hear testimony from new witnesses. It was only a matter of days until the President’s preordained acquittal.A vision board at the summit. “I did think someone needed to fight the fight within the Republican Party, that you can’t just give up even though it’s a long shot against a Republican President,” Bill Kristol, a Republican pundit, said. “Sarah agreed.”Photograph by Caroline Tompkins for The New YorkerDespite Longwell’s months of work, the President was emerging from impeachment emboldened and unchecked. Republicans for the Rule of Law had run about two million dollars’ worth of impeachment-related ads in thirty-nine states and congressional districts, sixteen ads nationally, and twenty-eight digital billboards targeting Republican members of Congress in nineteen states. But they had been up against what Longwell’s team estimated was almost certainly more than forty million dollars in ad spending by pro-Trump forces. Her mantra in politics was all about managing public opinion, yet public opinion about Trump remained essentially unchanged. “On an objective scale,” she said that morning, of her impeachment campaign, “it was a failure.”She was also frustrated with the Democrats. “It has really started to feel like they decided to impeach but they never really invested in impeaching,” she said. In key swing states, the ads from Republicans for the Rule of Law had been the only ones countering the Trump barrage. She pointed out that public support"
508,What Our Contagion Fables Are Really About,Jill Lepore,The New Yorker,-2,https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/03/30/what-our-contagion-fables-are-really-about,When the plague came to London in 1665 Londoners lost their wits. They consulted astrologers quacks the Bible. They searched their bodies for signs tokens of the disease: lumps blisters black spots. They begged for prophecies; they paid for predictions; they prayed; they yowled. They closed their eyes; they covered their ears. They wept in the street. They read alarming almanacs: “Certain it is books frighted them terribly.” The government keen to contain the panic attempted “to suppress the Printing of such Books as terrify’d the People” according to Daniel Defoe in “A Journal of the Plague Year” a history that he wrote in tandem with an advice manual called “Due Preparations for the Plague” in 1722 a year when people feared that the disease might leap across the English Channel again after having journeyed from the Middle East to Marseille and points north on a merchant ship. Defoe hoped that his books would be useful “both to us and to posterity though we should be spared from that portion of this bitter cup.” That bitter cup has come out of its cupboard.In 1665 the skittish fled to the country and alike the wise and those who tarried had reason for remorse: by the time they decided to leave “there was hardly a Horse to be bought or hired in the whole City” Defoe recounted and in the event the gates had been shut and all were trapped. Everyone behaved badly though the rich behaved the worst: having failed to heed warnings to provision they sent their poor servants out for supplies. “This Necessity of going out of our Houses to buy Provisions was in a great Measure the Ruin of the whole City” Defoe wrote. One in five Londoners died notwithstanding the precautions taken by merchants. The butcher refused to hand the cook a cut of meat; she had to take it off the hook herself. And he wouldn’t touch her money; she had to drop her coins into a bucket of vinegar. Bear that in mind when you run out of Purell.“Sorrow and sadness sat upon every Face” Defoe wrote. The government’s stricture on the publication of terrifying books proved pointless there being plenty of terror to be read on the streets. You could read the weekly bills of mortality or count the bodies as they piled up in the lanes. You could read the orders published by the mayor: “If any Person shall have visited any Man known to be infected of the Plague or entered willingly into any known infected House being not allowed: The House wherein he inhabiteth shall be shut up.” And you could read the signs on the doors of those infected houses guarded by watchmen each door marked by a foot-long red cross above which was to be printed in letters big enough to be read at a distance “Lord Have Mercy Upon Us.”Reading is an infection a burrowing into the brain: books contaminate metaphorically and even microbiologically. In the eighteenth century ships’ captains arriving at port pledged that they had disinfected their ships by swearing on Bibles that had been dipped in seawater. During tuberculosis scares public libraries fumigated books by sealing them in steel vats filled with formaldehyde gas. These days you can find out how to disinfect books on a librarians’ thread on Reddit. Your best bet appears to be either denatured-alcohol swipes or kitchen disinfectant in a mist-spray bottle although if you stick books in a little oven and heat them to a hundred and sixty degrees Fahrenheit there’s a bonus: you also kill bedbugs. (“Doesn’t harm the books!”) Or as has happened during the coronavirus closures libraries can shut their doors and bookstores too.But of course books are also a salve and a consolation. In the long centuries during which the plague ravaged Europe the quarantined if they were lucky enough to have books read them. If not and if they were well enough they told stories. In Giovanni Boccaccio’s Decameron from the fourteenth century seven women and three men take turns telling stories for ten days while hiding from the Black Death—that “last Pestilentiall mortality universally hurtfull to all that beheld it”—a plague so infamous that Boccaccio begged his readers not to put down his book as too hideous to hold: “I desire it may not be so dreadfull to you to hinder your further proceeding in reading.”The literature of contagion is vile. A plague is like a lobotomy. It cuts away the higher realms the loftiest capacities of humanity and leaves only the animal. “Farewell to the giant powers of man” Mary Shelley wrote in “The Last Man” in 1826 after a disease has ravaged the world. “Farewell to the arts—to eloquence.” Every story of epidemic is a story of illiteracy language made powerless man made brute.But then the existence of books no matter how grim the tale is itself a sign evidence that humanity endures in the very contagion of reading. Reading may be an infection the mind of the writer seeping unstoppable into the mind of the reader. And yet it is also—in its bidden intimacy an intimacy in all other ways banned in times of plague—an antidote proven unfailing and exquisite.Stories about plagues run the gamut from “Oedipus Rex” to “Angels in America.” “You are the plague” a blind man tells Oedipus. “It’s 1986 and there’s a plague friends younger than me are dead and I’m only thirty” a Tony Kushner character says. There are plagues here and plagues there from Thebes to New York horrible and ghastly but never one plague everywhere until Mary Shelley decided to write a follow-up to “Frankenstein.”“The Last Man” which is set in the twenty-first century is the first major novel to imagine the extinction of the human race by way of a global pandemic. Shelley published it at the age of twenty-nine after nearly everyone she loved had died leaving her as she put it “the last relic of a beloved race my companions extinct before me.” The book’s narrator begins as a poor and uneducated English shepherd: primitive man violent and lawless even monstrous. Cultivated by a nobleman and awakened to learning—“An earnest love of knowledge . . . caused me to pass days and nights in reading and study”—he is elevated by the Enlightenment and becomes a scholar a defender of liberty a republican and a citizen of the world.Then in the year 2092 the plague arrives ravaging first Constantinople. Year after year the pestilence dies away every winter (“a general and never-failing physician”) and returns every spring more virulent more widespread. It reaches across mountains it spreads over oceans. The sun rises black: a sign of doom. “Through Asia from the banks of the Nile to the shores of the Caspian from the Hellespont even to the sea of Oman a sudden panic was driven” Shelley wrote. “The men filled the mosques; the women veiled hastened to the tombs and carried offerings to the dead thus to preserve the living.” The nature of the pestilence remains mysterious. “It was called an epidemic. But the grand question was still unsettled of how this epidemic was generated and increased.” Not understanding its operation and full of false confidence legislators hesitate to act. “England was still secure. France Germany Italy and Spain were interposed walls yet without a breach between us and the plague.” Then come reports of entire nations destroyed and depopulated. “The vast cities of America the fertile plains of Hindostan the crowded abodes of the Chinese are menaced with utter ruin.” The fearful turn to history too late and find in its pages even in the pages of the Decameron the wrong lesson: “We called to mind the plague of 1348 when it was calculated that a third of mankind had been destroyed. As yet western Europe was uninfected; would it always be so?” It would not always be so. Inevitably the plague comes at last to England but by then the healthy have nowhere left to go because in the final terror of pandemic there is “no refuge on earth”: “All the world has the plague!”If in “Frankenstein” Shelley imagined the creation of a man by the stitching together of body parts in “The Last Man” she imagined the dismemberment of civilization. Death by death country by country the human race descends rung by rung down a ladder it had once built and climbed. Shelley’s narrator the erstwhile shepherd bears witness to the destruction and abandonment of all the “adornments of humanity” that had adorned his own naked self: law religion the arts science liberal government (“The nations are no longer!”) freedom commerce literature music theatre industry transportation communication agriculture. “Our minds late spread abroad through countless spheres and endless combinations of thought now retrenched themselves behind this wall of flesh eager to preserve its well-being only.” As the pestilence lays waste to the planet those few who survive are reduced to warring tribes until only one man our narrator is left shepherd once more. Wandering amid the ruins of Rome he enters the home of a writer and finds a manuscript on his writing table: “It contained a learned disquisition on the Italian language.” The last book is a study of language humanity’s first adornment. And what does our narrator do alone in the world? “I also will write a book I cried—for whom to read?” He calls it “The History of the Last Man” and dedicates it to the dead. It will have no readers. Except of course the readers of Shelley’s book.The great dream of the Enlightenment was progress; the great dread of epidemic is regress. But in American literature such destruction often comes with a democratic twist: contagion is the last leveller. Edgar Allan Poe’s 1842 tale “The Masque of the Red Death” is set in a medieval world plagued by a contagious disease that kills nearly instantly. “There were sharp pains and sudden dizziness and then profuse bleeding at the pores with dissolution” Poe wrote. “The scarlet stains upon the body and especially upon the face of the victim were the pest ban which shut him out from the aid and from the sympathy of his fellow-men.” In particular the rich have no sympathy for the poor. (Not irrelevantly Poe’s rich stepfather had entirely cut him off leaving Poe penniless and his wife was dying of consumption.) A haughty prince and his noblemen and women retire “to the deep seclusion of one of his castellated abbeys” where they live in depraved luxury until one night at a masked ball a figure arrives wearing a mask “made so nearly to resemble the countenance of a stiffened corpse that the closest scrutiny must have difficulty in detecting the cheat.” The visitor is the Red Death itself. Everyone in the abbey dies that night. The nobility cannot escape what the poor must endure.Poe’s red death becomes a pandemic in Jack London’s novel “The Scarlet Plague” serialized in 1912. (The disease is the very same: “The whole face and body turned scarlet in an hour’s time.”) The plague had come in the year 2013 and wiped out nearly everyone the high and the low the powerful nations and the powerless in all corners of the globe and left the survivors equal in their wretchedness and statelessness. One of the handful of survivors had been a scholar at the University of California Berkeley a professor of English literature. When the disease hit he hid out in the chemistry building and turned out to be immune to the virulence. For years he lived alone in an old hotel at Yosemite availing himself of its stores of canned food until emerging he joined a tiny band—the Chauffeurs led by a brute who had once been a chauffeur—and even found a wife. When the novel opens in the year 2073 the professor is a very old man a shepherd dressed in animal hide—“about his chest and shoulders hung a single mangy garment of goat-skin”—and living like an animal. He tells the story of the scarlet plague to his grandsons boys who “spoke in monosyllables and short jerky sentences that was more a gibberish than a language” but who are very handy with a bow and arrow. Their primitivism distresses the professor who sighs as he looks out across what was once San Francisco: “Where four million people disported themselves the wild wolves roam to-day and the savage progeny of our loins with prehistoric weapons defend themselves against the fanged despoilers. Think of it! And all because of the Scarlet Death.”London stole the red death from Poe and took the plot of “The Scarlet Plague” from “The Last Man”—except that London’s argument about the decline and fall of humankind is far less subtle than Shelley’s. “The human race is doomed to sink back farther and farther into the primitive night ere again it begins its bloody climb upward to civilization” the professor explains. For London it’s industrial capitalism and imperialism not the Enlightenment’s engine of moral progress that drive the climb from savagery to civilization and from scarcity to abundance. London’s descent of man is a descent into a very particular age-of-empire heart of darkness: the professor’s grandsons have “brown skin.” Before the plague came capitalists and imperialists amassed staggering fortunes. “What is money?” the boys ask their grandfather when he uses that word to describe a coin they find minted in 2012. (“The old man’s eyes glistened as he held the coin.”) All this—the white skin the fortunes—was lost! The professor’s greatest distress concerns the onetime chauffeur’s having wed by force the former wife of a magnate: “There she was Vesta Van Warden the young wife of John Van Warden clad in rags with marred and scarred and toil-calloused hands bending over the campfire and doing scullion work—she Vesta who had been born to the purple of the greatest baronage of wealth the world had ever known.” Equally distressing having conquered the continent the white man has in the end lost the West and the East too. The professor attempts to describe to his savage grandsons the fall of American cities whose fate he learned of in the earliest days of the pandemic when news could still reach California from other parts of the country before the last telegraph operators died:New York City and Chicago were in chaos. . . . A third of the New York police were dead. Their chief was also dead likewise the mayor. All law and order had ceased. The bodies were lying in the streets un-buried. All railroads and vessels carrying food and such things into the great city had ceased running and mobs of the hungry poor were pillaging the stores and warehouses. Murder and robbery and drunkenness were everywhere. Already the people had fled from the city by millions—at first the rich in their private motor-cars and dirigibles and then the great mass of the population on foot carrying the plague with them themselves starving and pillaging the farmers and all the towns and villages on the way.“The Scarlet Plague” published right before the Great War also contains a warning about the cost of world war the cost even of living in a world. “Long and long and long ago when there were only a few men in the world there were few diseases” the professor explains. “But as men increased and lived closely together in great cities and civilizations new diseases arose new kinds of germs entered their bodies. Thus were countless millions and billions of human beings killed. And the more thickly men packed together the more terrible were the new diseases that came to be.” His grandsons cannot fathom any of this. “The census of 2010 gave eight billions for the whole world” he tells them. They can hardly believe him and have no idea what a billion could be or a census or a world.“Ten thousand years of culture and civilization passed in the twinkling of an eye” the professor says. He has made it his life’s work to become a librarian to archive those ten thousand years. In a cave on Telegraph Hill he has stored all the books he could find even though he is the only man living who knows how to read. “In them is great wisdom” he tells his grandsons in the novel’s final chapter explaining that he has left as well a key to the alphabet. “Some day men will read again” he promises them. They have no idea what he is talking about. Still the reader does.The structure of the modern plague novel all the way to Stephen King’s “The Stand” and beyond is a series of variations on “A Journal of the Plague Year” (a story set within the walls of a quarantine) and “The Last Man” (a story set among a ragged band of survivors). Within those two structures though the scope for storytelling is vast and so is the scope for moralism historical argument and philosophical reflection. Every plague novel is a parable.Albert Camus once defined the novel as the place where the human being is abandoned to other human beings. The plague novel is the place where all human beings abandon all other human beings. Unlike other species of apocalyptic fiction where the enemy can be chemicals or volcanoes or earthquakes or alien invaders the enemy here is other humans: the touch of other humans the breath of other humans and very often—in the competition for diminishing resources—the mere existence of other humans.Camus in his 1947 novel “The Plague” sets the story within the walls of a quarantined French-Algerian town during the Second World War (the year is given as “194-”). With all its omens prophecies and scapegoats it might as well have been London in 1665. Dr. Bernard Rieux along with everyone else at first fails to read the signs. (The novel purports to be written from Rieux’s notebooks his journal of a plague year.) He watches a rat stumble at his doorstep:It moved uncertainly and its fur was sopping wet. The animal stopped and seemed to be trying to get its balance moved forward again toward the doctor halted again then spun round on itself with a little squeal and fell on its side. Its mouth was slightly open and blood was spurting from it. After gazing at it for a moment the doctor went upstairs.Rats come out from cellars and die on the streets in heaps. And yet neither the doctor nor anyone else does anything at all until after the first human death of a concierge. Then remorse dawns: “Reviewing that first phase in the light of subsequent events our townsfolk realized that they had never dreamed it possible that our little town should be chosen out for the scene of such grotesque happenings as the wholesale death of rats in broad daylight or the decease of concierges through exotic maladies.”Soon we learn “the whole town was running a temperature.” The number of cases rises and then it leaps. Eleven deaths in forty-eight hours then more. The government health committee wishes to avoid using the word “plague” but unless it is used emergency measures cannot be put in place. Notices are posted but only in obscure places and in very small type and as the doctor observes “it was hard to find in these notices any indication that the authorities were facing the situation squarely.” Finally in desperation the government adopts a policy of “deratization” and when thirty people die in a single day closes the town.The plague is of course the virus of Fascism. No one in the town gives much thought to the rats until it’s too late—even though the plague “rules out any future cancels journeys silences the exchange of views”—and few pay sufficient attention to the rats even after it’s too late. This is their folly: “They fancied themselves free and no one will ever be free so long as there are pestilences.”“The Plague” does not chronicle a pandemic in the sense that the plague never escapes the town and yet Camus’s plague is a plague without end. But Rieux learns from reading history that there really is only one plague across all of human history travelling from place to place through the passage of time from “Chinese towns cluttered up with victims silent in their agony” to “the damp putrefying pallets stuck to the mud floor at the Constantinople lazar-house where the patients were hauled up from their beds with hooks” to “cartloads of dead bodies rumbling through London’s ghoul-haunted darkness—nights and days filled always everywhere with the eternal cry of human pain.” Next on the list? Auschwitz Dachau Buchenwald. The plague is man.Haunted by this knowledge Rieux locked in an unwanted asylum suffers from an extremity of solitude and from the alienation and brutality of modernity:Sometimes at midnight in the great silence of the sleep-bound town the doctor turned on his radio before going to bed for the few hours’ sleep he allowed himself. And from the ends of the earth across thousands of miles of land and sea kindly well-meaning speakers tried to voice their fellow-feeling and indeed did so but at the same time proved the utter incapacity of every man truly to share in suffering that he cannot see.For those in isolation there is no world: “the plague had swallowed up everything and everyone.” They are saved at the last minute by a serum and the town erupts in joyful celebration. In the novel’s closing words the doctor thinks of his reading. “He knew what those jubilant crowds did not know but could have learned from books: that the plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good . . . and that perhaps the day would come when for the bane and the enlightening of men it would rouse up its rats again and send them forth to die in a happy city.” Men will always become again rats.Camus’s observation about “the utter incapacity of every man truly to share in suffering that he cannot see” is the subject of José Saramago’s brilliant and devastating reimagining of the plague tale “Blindness” from 1995 in which the Defoe-like doctor is an ophthalmologist and the disease that reduces humans to animals is the inability to see. As historical parable “Blindness” indicts the twentieth-century authoritarian state: the institutionalization of the vulnerable the ruthlessness of military rulers. When the disease strikes the government rounds up all the blind and locks them up in a mental asylum where blindly they go to war with one another. They steal they rape. “The blind are always at war always have been at war” Saramago writes in the novel’s darkest observation.But “Blindness” is far darker than any history lesson. For Saramago blindness isn’t a disease; blindness is the human condition. There is in the novel only one person left with sight. She reads to the blind which for them is both a paradise and an exasperation: “This is all we are good for listening to someone reading us the story of a human mankind that existed before us.” And that in the modern plague novel is the final terror of every world-ending plague the loss of knowledge for which reading itself is the only cure. It is this realization that grips Saramago’s ophthalmologist at the very moment that he loses his sight before the disease is known: the understanding of the preciousness beauty and fragility of knowledge. Puzzled by a patient who has come to his office after being stricken suddenly and inexplicably blind—he sees not black but only a milky whiteness—the eye doctor goes home and after dinner consults the books in his library. “Late that night he laid aside the books he had been studying rubbed his weary eyes and leaned back in his chair” Saramago writes. He decides to go at last to bed. “It happened a minute later as he was gathering up the books to return them to the bookshelf. First he perceived that he could no longer see his hands then he knew he was blind.”Everything went white. As white as a blank page.
509,How Doctors Live with the Risks of the Coronavirus,Benjamin Wallace-Wells,The New Yorker,-2,https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-doctors-live-with-the-risks-of-the-coronavirus,Reports from northern Italy often lighten the news but lately they have leadened it. Last Saturday The New England Journal of Medicine published an alarmed dispatch from a group of doctors at the Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital in Bergamo. “Our own hospital is highly contaminated and we are far beyond the tipping point” Dr. Mirco Nacoti and his twelve co-authors wrote. They were concerned not just about the condition of their hospital but about the safety of hospitals in general—about the role that the medical system could play under extreme pressure in spreading the new coronavirus.“We are learning that hospitals might be the main covid-19 carriers as they are rapidly populated by infected patients facilitating transmission to uninfected patients” the Bergamo doctors wrote. The situation in their own hospital was bad and that of outlying hospitals in the region was worse: patients were lying on mattresses on the floor and medications and oxygen were unavailable. Cemeteries were overwhelmed “which will create another public health problem.” In the midst of an epidemic the physicians argued the familiar model of patient-centered care in a hospital could no longer do the job; an entirely different model which they called “community-centered care” was needed in which more health care would be delivered outside of the hospital through community surveillance home care and mobile clinics. If the first wave of concern about hospitals in the pandemic has been about their capacity to absorb the coming surge of patients this report hinted at a second in which the focus might be on how to prevent the hospitals and the people who worked there from transmitting the virus themselves.Over the past few days the news from American hospitals on the front lines of the pandemic has emphasized the lack of personal protective equipment. There aren’t nearly enough swabs which in a dark twist turned out to be produced mainly in northern Italy. There also aren’t enough simple surgical masks or the more protective N95 masks or gowns. As the number of cases rose into the tens of thousands last week hospitals began issuing open calls to help supply the necessary gear. Some of these efforts had a slightly whimsical flavor such as the message on the website of Providence St. Joseph Health which operates fifty-one hospitals mostly in the West: “For those in the Seattle area with a willing heart the ability to sew and a sewing machine we have an opportunity to make masks now.” Others were more pragmatic. Peter Slavin the president of Massachusetts General Hospital spoke with NBC’s Boston affiliate to try to galvanize a grassroots development program for N95 masks. “We have vast numbers of 3-D printers in this country. The formula for making these masks is available online for free” Slavin said. I spoke with Slavin on Monday morning and he told me that he wasn’t sure whether the right historical analogy was “the Manhattan Project or the Marshall Plan or Dunkirk but we need to unleash the imaginative energy of people around the country to solve this problem.”The public has answered these pleas in volume. All kinds of entities large and tiny have been devoting themselves to the gown- and mask-making cause. “I mostly talk about movies on here” a screenwriter and podcaster named Jeffrey Zhang wrote on Twitter on Friday “but here goes. We are currently pivoting our factory to solely make surgical masks and other medical garments in short supply. We can make 2 million masks a day and are looking to help in any way possible.” The head of R. & D. for a publicly traded medical-supply company in Silicon Valley sent me a direct message saying that he was cold-calling ventilator companies offering to help with production and was looking for leads. (I’d written a piece last week about how doctors were navigating ventilator limits.) A guy in my fantasy basketball league made a similar plea on the league message board—he was going to start manufacturing personal protective equipment and he needed contacts.VIDEO FROM THE NEW YORKERComparing the Influenza Epidemic of 1918 to the CoronavirusSlavin said that so many people had responded to his call for P.P.E. manufacturers that Mass General had set up a new team to handle all of them. Every high school seemed to have a 3-D printer and every high-school science club seemed to want to help. Slavin said “Managing this outpouring of support has ironically strained the system even further.” He sounded relaxed capable of noticing ironies which may have been professional habit but was itself reassuring. Acquiring more personal protective equipment was part of a larger effort he said to help protect the staff and keep the hospital from becoming a vector for transmission. Units are being established for covid-19 patients as they are at hospitals across the country; all staff are required to wear surgical masks at all times and some entrances to the hospital have been closed so that anyone entering can be channelled past hand-hygiene stations and put on a mask. The intent of all these changes is to provide an inward-facing form of protection to insulate the staff against getting sick but also an outward-facing one to insulate the public. Slavin said “Not only do we want to keep our health-care workers safe and healthy for their own health we also don’t want them infecting patients.”The other day another article in The New England Journal of Medicine caught my eye—an essay written by a young emergency-medicine physician in San Francisco named Christian Rose who mentioned that in Wuhan forty-one per cent of covid-19 transmissions had taken place within hospitals. Rose quoted a W.H.O. official named Mike Ryan who said “We’ve always said that the real point of entry for a coronavirus is a busy emergency room.” Rose’s essay centered on his own realization that by helping patients sick with covid-19 he also made it more likely that he would end up transmitting the virus himself. Rose lives with his wife and mother-in-law who has a chronic lung condition making her especially vulnerable to covid-19. Once Rose was potentially exposed to the virus at Kaiser Permanente’s San Francisco hospital he stayed with a colleague until his wife set up a basement isolation room. Should he inadvertently infect his mother-in-law Rose wrote “Her lung reserve is so low that she would most likely wind up on a mechanical respirator in an intensive-care unit probably on the thirteenth floor at U.C.S.F. where I trained several years ago. . . . It is not unlikely that she would die that this invisible invader this microscopic enemy would be the end of her story. All this just because I came home.”I reached Rose who has a mustache and a pensive manner at home last week after he had returned from a night shift at Kaiser Permanente. The hospital wasn’t yet overwhelmed he said but there were already some logistical tensions: there were seventeen separate instructions for putting on covid-protective gear Rose said and eleven separate instructions for taking them off. “Last night I had a very sick patient who needed C.P.R. and I spent almost four minutes like two rounds of C.P.R. getting the stuff brought to me so I could go in the room” he said. The guidance about when to use protective gear and when to avoid doing so could be bewildering and stressful. “Humans are fallible” Rose said. “You need to not say ‘Hey maybe a N95 mask works maybe it doesn’t but it doesn’t matter because we don’t have enough anyway but if you have one maybe re-use it.’ You should just tell them ‘We have them. Here’s a mask. Use it. And please don’t touch your eyes.’ ”Early on in the crisis Rose told me he’d noticed that his colleagues were feeling somewhat removed from their friends and family outside of the hospital because they were experiencing the stress and risk of the crisis before anyone else. “What to me was weird was noticing that a lot of us felt really alone” Rose said. “It’s just this lost feeling that all of my emergency colleagues—the nurses the techs—feel where we know how bad it can be but society doesn’t feel it yet.” The longer the hospitals are preoccupied with the covid-19 pandemic of course the more medical risk the general population will absorb. Right now procedures and preventative scans are being cancelled. Postpone a chemotherapy session and the risk that your cancer might metastasize rises; postpone it twice and then three times and the risk rises again and again. By making the hospitals ever so slightly less safe the P.P.E. crisis subtly increases the risk to everyone of a sick person visiting the hospital in the same way that a side effect might elevate the risk of prescribing a drug.That gap between the doctors and the public still exists Rose said but it has closed somewhat. Perhaps eventually the public would undergo the same psychological adjustments that health-care providers had. “We know that people change the more exposure they have to risk—so people will feel really stressed out at first and then it normalizes.” Rose said “Your brain just changes the way you live with that. And all of a sudden you start to normalize things that are really abnormal.” Rose sounded grateful for the past couple of weeks when covid-19 patients had trickled in and he and his colleagues had had the chance to practice the seventeen steps for donning protective gear as well as more consequential maneuvers to reduce the risk that they might spread the virus. “It’s like everyone feels on the roller coaster before you go over the drop” Rose said. “It’s like you’re about ready.”
510,Republican who refuses to concede defeat in Kentucky governor's race calls for statewide 'recanvass' that could lead to full-scale recount after he claimed election 'irregularities',David Martosko,The Daily Mail,2,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7658325/Republican-refuses-concede-defeat-Kentucky-governors-race-calls-statewide-recanvas.html,Kentucky's Republican governor Matt Bevin asked state election authorities on Wednesday to re-check the final totals in every voting machine that was in use on Tuesday when he appeared to have lost his job to a Democratic rival in a squeaker.A 'recanvass' as it's called has never reversed the result of an election in the Bluegrass State. Andy Beshear ended Tuesday night 5189 votes ahead of Bevin but the governor has refused to concede the race. 'What we know is that there really are a number of significant irregularities the specifics of which we are in the process of getting affidavits and other information that will help us to get a better understanding of what did or did not happen' Bevin said Wednesday afternoon.'Those will be forthcoming in the days ahead but that is the cart getting ahead of the horse because none of this will be really followed through on until after the recanvassing process.' Beshear claimed victory and his campaign said in a statement that the apparent winner 'is already working on his transition so that he can best serve the people of Kentucky on day one.'Bevin campaign manager Davis Paine said that Kentuckians 'deserve a fair and honest election. With reports of irregularities we are exercising the right to ensure that every lawful vote was counted.'The Bevin camp has not said what the 'irregularities' are how much of an impact they may have had and how they might be documented.Some Kentucky counties use vote-tallying machines that don't produce a paper trail leaving them vulnerable to tampering. Newer computerized systems in other parts of the state were shown last year to be easy for hackers to penetrate. One model was breached in less than two minutes.  Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes a Democrat who unsuccessfully challenged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel in 2014 received Bevin's request on Wednesday. She is expected to order the recanvassing thie week. That will require election officials in each of Kentucky's 120 counties to double-check numbers in every voting machine and report the numbers to their county clerks. The goal is to ensure that the Election Day figures weren't misreported.Bevin could ask for a statewide recount if the recanvassing doesn't change the result. He must make his request by November 15; his campaign would have to cover the entire cost.If Republicans should uncover corruption in the election the Bevin campaign could also make a petition to contest the results – provided there's a convincing reason.The Kentucky state legislature which is controlled by the GOP would then have the power to re-examine the election and possibly order a new one. President Donald Trump held a flashy and energetic rally Monday night to support Bevin who was leading in a reputable poll by 5 points last week but appears to have lost anyway.Pushing back against the idea that his endorsement has become a 'Midas touch' in reverse Trump and his White House insisted that the result wasn't his fault. 'Our big Kentucky Rally on Monday night had a massive impact on all of the races' the president tweeted. Bevin trailed Democrat Andy Beshear by less than four-tenths of a percentage point after the votes were counted – in a race that the Associated Press said was too close to call.A week ago Bevin was projected to win by 5 points in a Trafalgar Group poll of 1117 likely voters the largest group anyone surveyed about the race. That suggests his lead evaporated around the time Trump came to Kentucky to support him.But the president 'sees the Bevin race as an anomaly' a White House official told DailyMail.com noting Trump's observation that five of the six statewide races in the Bluegrass State went to Republicans.They included the first African-American to ever win an election for the Kentucky attorney general's office.   In mid-October a Mason-Dixon Poll of 625 likely voters had Bevin and Beshear tied.The only poll showing Beshear with a lead was conducted by Targoz Research a Nashville organization that offered to conduct the polling for $2750 – a pittance compared to the resources most surveys require.Targoz reported that its panel of just 401 likely voters gave Beshear a 19-point advantage. The FiveThirtyEight political data analysis website rates the firm between a 'C' and a 'D' for the reliability of its predictions.  Trump claimed Tuesday night that Bevin 'picked up at least 15 points in last days but perhaps not enough.''Fake News will blame Trump!' he added. Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale said in a statement that Bevin was a weaker candidate than the other Republicans who emerged as winners.'The President just about dragged Gov. Matt Bevin across the finish line helping him run stronger than expected in what turned into a very close race at the end' he said. 'A final outcome remains to be seen.'

513,Democrat leads Kentucky governor's race by 4658 votes but Republican WON'T concede: Democrats praise 'earth-shattering victory' in a red state while Trump campaign gripes that the president had to 'drag' apparent loser across the finish line,David Martosko and Nikki Schwab,The Daily Mail,2,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7653979/Kentucky-governors-election-flip-Democrat-Trumps-coattails-hang-balance.html,"Republicans appear to have lost the Kentucky governor's mansion in Tuesday's off-year elections to a Democrat who Donald Trump publicly pilloried less than a day before polls opened.The president rallied Kentuckians one day before polls opened gambling on taking the credit if the GOP governor kept his job. But now Trump's coattails seem to have shortened. Democratic state attorney general Andy Beshear led Republican Gov. Matt Bevin by just 0.3 percentage points. But that slim margin of 4658 votes was enough to make Democrats giddy about seizing power in the state capital.NBC News called the race for Beshear as did Kentucky's secretary of state Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes. As of 11:00 p.m. the Associated Press and the Fox news Channel both considered the race 'too close to call.' Bevin said his campaign was 'not conceding this race by any stretch.''We know for a fact there have been irregularities and the outcome will be determined by law' he told supporters. 'This isn't a political issue as much as it is an integrity issue and the process must be followed.'Beshear was eager to move forward. 'I haven't had an opportunity yet to speak to Governor Bevin' he said in a victory speech 'but my expectation is that he will honor the election that was held tonight.'Bevin could choose to request a recount or a less dramatic measure a recanvassing. That would involve county boards of election reviewing vote totals in machines at every polling place. Kentucky law does not provide for an automatic recount for elections whose margins of victory are exceedingly close. Challengers have one week to request it and must pay for the process which a judge oversees.Sensing that he will lead a bitterly divided state Beshear promised Republicans that he would 'work hard to earn your trust.'But he hinted at uncompromising partisanship to come casting elections as 'right versus wrong' instead of 'right versus left.Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez congratulated Beshear saying his apparent 'earth-shattering victory in a state Trump won by 30 points should terrify him and every Republican running in 2020.'Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale blamed Bevin noting that the other five Republicans running for statewide office all won.'The President just about dragged Gov. Matt Bevin across the finish line helping him run stronger than expected in what turned into a very close race at the end' Parscale said. 'A final outcome remains to be seen.'Democrats' Kentucky victory is less an advance than a rebound: Thirteen of the state's 16 governors since World War II were Democrats and Beshear's father held the office until 2015. As election officials tallied key races in two other states the younger Beshear's apparent victory set an uncertain tone for the president that carried over into Virginia and only stopped at the Mississippi border. With 88 per cent of precincts reported there Republican Tate Reeves was making comparatively easy work of Democrat Jim Hood in the Mississippi governor's race. Reeves led by 7.1 percentage points and was declared the winner with vote-counting still underway.Virginia especially looked bad for Republicans. Democrats took over the state Senate with an apparent 21–19 margin and were poised to take a 54–45 advantage in the House of Delegates with 1 independent likely to win a seat.Republicans had controlled both houses of the State Assembly by 2 seats in each.The president spent the past week reliving the high-wire political strategy that helped North Carolina Republicans pull a rabbit out of a hat in a September special election. Republican Dan Bishop then a state senator came from far behind to win a U.S. House seat there after Trump stumped for him. His rallies in Mississippi on Friday and Kentucky on Monday were pleas for proof that enthusiasm from the political base he sees as a 'silent majority' hasn't softened during a season of nonstop impeachment news. Trump called Beshear 'a major lefty' on Monday night in Lexington and called him 'too extreme and too dangerous for the state of Kentucky.'And he spun Bevin's legendary crankiness and low popularity statewide as a bristly positive for Kentuckians.'When he needs something for Kentucky like money like aid like when he wants me to call one of the many manufacturers now that are coming into Kentucky ... I say ""Matt do I have to do it? Please! Please!"" But isn't that really what you want him to do?''He's such a pain in the ass' the president said. 'But that's what you want' from a governor.  'Here's the story' Trump told thousands of supporters Monday night. 'If you win they are going to make it like ""Ho hum."" And if you lose they are going to say Trump suffered the greatest defeat in the history of the world. You can't let that happen to me!' Bevin and Beshear were tied last month according to a Mason-Dixon poll.   But Trump helped to nationalize the race Bevin did his part by preaching to conservatives about pro-life positions and objections to 'sanctuary cities.' The president ignored Beshear and Bevin as reality set in Tuesday night tweeting only about a down-ballot victory that made a Republican the Kentucky attorney general for the first time in more than 70 years.   Daniel Cameron the winner is also the first African-American ever voted individually into state-wide office in the history of Kentucky. Trump will travel to Louisiana on Wednesday to rile up his faithful in Cajun country and make the case for ousting John Bel Edwards the Democratic Party's only governor in the Deep South.The president rallied in the Pelican State less than four weeks ago arguing for an election stalemate that would force a runoff between Edwards and one of the two Republicans on the ballot. It worked: Edwards failed to capture 50 per cent of the vote. Now he must face Republican Eddie Rispone on November 16. Trump is slated to travel Wednesday night to Monroe Louisiana for a 7:00 p.m. rally at the Monroe Civic Center."
514,Donald Trump Jr. jokes that Mitt Romney is 'my favorite Democrat' as he touts new book and WON'T rule out running for office but says he likes campaign fight more than political 'day job',David Martosko,The Daily Mail,2,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7651791/Donald-Trump-Jr-jokes-Mitt-Romney-favorite-Democrat-WONT-rule-running-office.html,A morning TV anchor stumped Donald Trump Jr. on Tuesday with a parting request to name his 'favorite Democrat' – only to hear him come back seconds later with an answer: Mitt Romney.Romney a first-term U.S. senator from Utah was the Republican Party's presidential nominee in 2012. He lost to Barack Obama in a race that President Donald Trump called 'winnable.' The elder Trump filed trademark papers for his 'Make America Great Again' slogan less than two weeks after that election fuming about the missed opportunity to drive Obama from office.The president has said Romney 'choked like a dog' and routinely frames him as a stealth liberal in a party that's trending to the right.    So when CBS This Morning co-host Gayle King asked his son 'Who is your favorite Democrat?' the most surprising thing about Trump Jr.'s answer was that it took three seconds to collect.  'Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney's my favorite Democrat Gayle. How about that?' he asked as King wrapped up an interview segment. 'No' she chuckled back wagging a finger. The president's eldest son was promoting 'Triggered' a polemic-filled book timed for release as Democrats race toward an impeachment vote in the House of Representatives.The exercise in political flame-throwing shot up to the no. 3 slot among all of Amazon's book offerings by 9:00 a.m. on Tuesday its first day on sale to the public.  With girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle in tow he expects to barnstorm the book-media circuit this week with bare knuckles out.  'He's not the lightweight everyone wants him to be' a source close to Trupm Jr. said Tuesday. 'He loves being underestimated.'At the top of the Amazon chart was 'A Warning' the forthcoming tell-all from the anonymous Trump administration official who penned a scathing New York Times op-ed a year ago. The latest installment in the 'Diary of a Wimpy Kid' kid-lit series stood at no. 2.Trump Jr. was his usual non-wimpy self on TV venting about 'woke goalposts' that 'keep moving' as progressives gain ground in America's culture wars.He clobbered the mass media for partisanship Democrats for impeachment power-hoarding and athletes who set new records in women's sports despite being born male.The Trump scion who runs the family real estate business with his brother Eric sounded like a candidate but insisted he's not running for anything – yet. 'I'm interested in winning 2020 for my father right now. We'll worry about everything else later' Trump Jr. said. 'I don't ever rule anything out.''Right now I like the campaigning part' he said. 'I actually enjoy some of that fight. I like getting out there and being with real people and seeing the difference my father and his policies are making in their lives.'But 'I don't know right now at this stage of my life that I would like the day-job component of it' he acknowledged.Trump Jr. told a Bloomberg Radio interviewer in March that a political future could unfold on its own without any rush.''My father decided to get into politics at 68. I'm 41 I've got plenty of time' he said.
515,'Go big or go home': Impeachment inquiry transcripts reveal how Ukraine ambassador was told to tweet her support for Donald Trump by his hotel millionaire EU ambassador – then was ousted when she didn't,David Martosko and Geoff Earle,The Daily Mail,2,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7648543/Democrats-impeachment-inquiry-releases-hundreds-pages-transcripts-two-witnesses.html,The Democrat-led House committees in charge of an impeachment inquiry targeting Donald Trump released two transcripts on Monday the first records of closed-door interviews about the president's links with Ukraine. They painted a picture of a U.S. ambassador in a former Soviet republic with no defenders after she failed to praise the president - and who told lawmakers she felt 'threatened' by the president her ultimate boss.U.S. ambassador to the European Union told then-ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch she told lawmakers to 'Go big or go home' meaning that she should publicly profess her support for the president.She didn't alienating Trump's attorney Rudy Giuliani who led a push to oust her. Yovanovitch went home when Trump recalled her in June ending her diplomatic career.The president tweeted Sunday night that he suspected transcripts reaching the public could be altered by the Democrats who want to oust him – especially California Rep. Adam Schiff.Witnesses before congressional committees are permitted to review transcripts of their testimony and approve them before their release.Yovanovitch and Michael McKinley a former adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sat with committee members and staff in October.The transcript of Yovanovitch's interview shows her telling lawmakers that the Trump-appointed ambassador to the European Union hotelier Gordon Sondland advised her to tweet out her support for President Trump.'He said you know you need to go big or go home. You need to you know tweet out there that you support the President and that all these are lies and everything else' she said of one conversation.'And you know so you know I mean obviously that was advice. It was advice that I did not see how I could implement in my role as an Ambassador and as a Foreign Service Officer.'She was asked: 'Did he actually say 'support President Trump'? Was that his advice that you publicly say something to that effect?'Yovanovitch responded: 'Yes. I mean he may not have used the words 'support President Trump' but he said: You know the President. Well maybe you don't know him personally but you know you know the sorts of things that he likes. You know go out there battling aggressively and you know praise him or support him.' Ultimately Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani led a push to have her removed. Ukrainian officials had warned her in advance that Rudy Giuliani and other allies of President Donald Trump were planning to 'do things including to me' and were 'looking to hurt' her she said.The former envoy who was pushed out of her job in May on Trump's orders testified that a senior Ukrainian official told her that 'I really needed to watch my back.'   Yovanovitch she said was told by Ukrainian officials last November or December that Giuliani the president's personal lawyer was in touch with Ukraine's former top prosecutor Yuri Lutsenko 'and that they had plans and that they were going to you know do things including to me.'She said she was told Lutsenko 'was looking to hurt me in the U.S.' Yovanovitch told the investigators that the campaign against her which included an article that was retweeted by Donald Trump Jr. undermined her ability to serve as a 'credible' ambassador and she wanted Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to issue a statement defending her. But no statement was issued. She testified that a State Department official named Philip Reeker told her that as Giuliani's campaign wore on Pompeo conveyed he could no longer insulate her from Trump's desire to send her packing.'Mr. Reeker said that I you know I would need to leave. I needed to leave as soon as possible. That apparently as I stated in my statement the President had been – had wanted me to leave since July of 2018 … and that the Secretary had tried to protect me but was no longer able to do that' she said in her testimony.'Who had concerns as of July 2018?' a lawmaker asked her. 'President Trump' she responded. 'And was that the first that you had heard of that?' the lawmaker followed up. Yovanovitch said it was and 'I was shocked.' At one point in April Yovanovitch said she received a call from Carol Perez a top foreign service official at around 1 a.m. Ukraine time abruptly telling her she needed to immediately fly back to Washington. Yovanovitch said when she asked why Perez told her 'I don't know but this is about your security. You need to come home immediately. You need to come home on the next plane.'Yovanovitch said she didn't think Perez meant it was to protect her physical security. Instead Yovanovitch said Perez told her it was for 'my well-being people were concerned.'    I don't know but this is about your security. You need to come home immediately. You need to come home on the next planeWhat State Department official told Marie Yovanovich The former envoy stressed to investigators that she was not disloyal to the president.'I have heard the allegation in the media that I supposedly told our embassy team to ignore the President's orders since he was going to be impeached' she said. 'That allegation is false.'She answered 'no' when asked point blank if she'd ever 'badmouthed' Trump in Ukraine and said she felt U.S. policy in Ukraine 'actually got stronger' because of Trump's decision to provide lethal assistance to the country military aid that later was held up by the White House as it pushed for investigations into Trump's political foes.Under friendly questioning from Democratic Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York Yovanovitch said she considered herself good at her job and had been there more than three years and that her bosses at the State Department wanted to extend her tour.'It seems to me they threw you to the wolves. Is that what happened?' Maloney asked.Yovanovitch replied: 'Well clearly they didn't want me in Ukraine anymore.'Long hours into her testimony Yovanovitch was asked why she was such 'a thorn in their side' that Giuliani and others wanted her fired.'Honestly' she said 'it's a mystery to me.' Yovanovitch was also asked about the call between Trump and Zlensky which took place after she was removed from her post and was released by the White House after the whistleblower complaint was made public. In it Trump told the Ukrainian president: 'The former ambassador from the United States the woman was bad news and the people she was dealing with in the Ukraine were bad news so I just want to let you know that.'She told the Democratic majority's counsel: 'I was shocked. I mean I was very surprised that President Trump would—first of all that I would feature repeatedly in a Presidential phone call but secondly that the President would speak about me or any ambassador in that way to a foreign counterpart.'Yovanovitch was asked if she felt threatened and said: 'Yes.'  She added: ' I was wondering you know soon after this transcript came out there was the news that the IG [Inspector General of the Intelligence Community] brought to this committee all sorts of documentation I guess about me that had been transferred to the FBI. 'You know  I was wondering i s there an active investigation against me in the FBI? I don't know.' She added that friends were 'very concerned' for her personal safety.Yovanovitch said that she was generally shocked by the way the Trump administration threw the State Department into chaos.'You know ... you're going to think that I'm incredibly naive but I couldn't imagine all of the things that have happened over the last 5 or 7 months' she said. 'I just couldn't imagine it.' She pushed back robustly on claims made by Republican questioners that she was biased against Trump and that she ordered the 'monitoring' of a string of conservative figures. House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff says his panel and others are releasing the transcripts so 'the American public will begin to see for themselves' what evidence exists that Trump may have committed an impeachable offense.Democrats have held interviews in private for weeks and held a vote days ago to authorize that process.Republicans have called for the release of the transcripts which they believe will show Trump acted appropriately and lawfully during a now-famous July 25 call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.Trump claimed Sunday that '[i]f Shifty Adam Schiff who is a corrupt politician who fraudulently made up what I said on the 'call' is allowed to release transcripts of the Never Trumpers & others that are & were interviewed he will change the words that were said to suit the Dems purposes.''Republicans should give their own transcripts of the interviews to contrast with Schiff's manipulated propaganda' the president urged.'House Republicans must have nothing to do with Shifty's rendition of those interviews. He is a proven liar leaker & freak who is really the one who should be impeached!'Members of Congress can be investigated for ethics violations and they can be expelled by a vote of their peers but they cannot be impeached.
516,Is Kamala Harris next to go?: California Democrat on brink of exiting presidential race after firing dozens of campaign staff and dropping to three per cent in the polls,Leah McDonald and Geoffrey Earle,The Daily Mail,2,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7641401/Is-Kamala-Harris-Democrat-exit-race-shedding-staff.html,Speculation is mounting that Kamala Harris could be the next contender to exit the Democratic race after she fired dozens of staff members and shut offices in New Hampshire.  The California Democrat 55 is seeking to inject new life into her presidential bid which is struggling in the polls and facing money problems as she goes all-in in Iowa.It comes as Beto O'Rourke the former Texas congressman announced Friday that he was ending his Democratic presidential campaign which failed to recapture the enthusiasm and fundraising prowess of his 2018 Senate race.And there was fervent speculation on social media that Harris would be next to drop out as her campaign officials confirmed to Fox News on Friday that only a 'handful' of staff were retained in New Hampshire the state that holds the first primary.   Three field offices in Keene Nashua and Portsmouth were also closed and the state headquarters  will remain open with a small number of staff.  'From the beginning of this campaign Kamala Harris and this team set out with one goal — to win the nomination and defeat Donald Trump in 2020. 'This requires us to make difficult strategic decisions and make clear priorities not threaten to drop out or deploy gimmicks' wrote her campaign manager Juan Rodriguez in a memo explaining the changes Politico reported.He noted the 'incredibly competitive resource environment' she faces. But many social media users interpreted the news as a sign she could be next to drop out.Harris is running at just 3 per cent in the Real Clear Politics polling average which as the Republican National Committee notes in an email trumpeting the bad news puts her about on par with Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard. One named Ian Samuel wrote: ' Kamala Harris going all-in on Iowa—an overwhelmingly white state where Buttigieg has regional advantages and where she cannot possibly hope to finish better than 5th—is the perfect capstone to her campaign of blunders. I will miss her.'Another named Marla Hohner claimed: '1st BETO now KAMALA. Kamala Harris lays off staff shuts offices in New Hampshire.'@elyse777 also said: 'Dropping like flies.... like mosquitos. Sucking blood & lying to the American People. Don't let the door hit you on the way out Kamala.'Harris has tried to use her background as a prosecutor as a calling card to attack Trump during the impeachment battle. She told 'Late Show' host Seth Meyer's Monday night: 'We have a clear display of consciousness of guilt ... We have a cover-up that is that. 'And we have a confession. And as a former prosecutor I know a confession when I see it ... And frankly somebody ought to tell Donald Trump he has a right to remain silent' she said. She may get a platform for free this fall if the Senate ends up taking up any House impeachment articles for President Trump. But she was not a central figure during the last presidential debate in Ohio and her breakout moment when she attacked former Vice President Joe Biden over school bussing came back in June.Rodriguez resorted to citing two candidates who won their party's primaries – but lost the general election.'Plenty of winning primary campaigns like John Kerry's in 2004 and John McCain's in 2008 have had to make tough choices on their way to the nomination and this is no different' he wrote.At the end of the last fundraising quarter Harris raised $12 million but spent nearly $15 million leaving her campaign further in the hole. She pulled in a similar amount the previous quarter. According to her campaign she raised $35 million from over 350000 donors.In a Suffolk University / USA Today poll released Wednesday Harris was at 3 per cent trailing Biden Sen. Elizabeth Warren Sen.

518,Senior House Democrat calls Purple Heart vet's closed door impeachment testimony 'extremely disturbing' as Donald Trump blasts witness as 'Never Trumper' and allies accuse Ukrainian language speaker of dual loyalty and 'espionage',Geoff Earle and David Martosko,The Daily Mail,2,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7627137/Senior-House-Democrat-calls-Purple-Heart-vets-closed-door-testimony-extremely-disturbing.html,The acting chairwoman of the House Oversight Committee called testimony Tuesday by an Army officer who monitored President Donald Trump's call with the head of Ukraine 'extremely disturbing.' Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman who serves on the White House National Security Counsel spoke for several hours Tuesday morning after Trump blasted him as a 'never Trumper' and key administration allies questioned the wounded Iraq War veteran whether his first loyalty was to the United States. During a break in Vindman's deposition Rep. Carolyn Maloney of New York the acting chair of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee called Vindman's testimony 'extremely extremely extremely disturbing' NBC News reported.  During the closed-door questioning by lawmakers in a secure room used by the House Intelligence Committee Republicans and Democrats clashed. Democrats led by panel chair Rep. Adam Schiff accused Republicans of trying to use the interview to out the whistle-blower who first brought forward claims of an alleged effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens using military aid and a White House meeting as leverage. It's very hard to out somebody that you don't know who they are' Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) a Trump ally told DailyMail.com denying the charge.'In general you want to know who your witnesses have talked to about certain information that they're sharing. And that's the extent of the conversation' he said. He said he wanted to know 'whomever they've talked to.'Even as he denied trying to unmask the whistle-blower tho stoked the impeachment inquiry Meadows said he had a high amount of certainty of who it might be.'This was just some questions about who did you talked to and [Democrats] got all weirded out because they thought we were going to out somebody that we have no knowledge of who they are' he said.'If I had a degree of certainty of who the whistle-blower is I promise you I would tell you. I have no idea who it is. Well I have an idea but I don’t – I’m less than 80 per cent confident' he continued. 'I think there’s three or four people it could be.''I don’t do anything without a hundred per cent knowledge. It’s not 100 I’m not going to say it' he concluded.Vindman told investigators Tuesday that he listened to Donald Trump's call with Ukraine's new president Volodymr Zelensky and 'did not think it was proper' - potentially a huge boost to the Democrats' impeachment inquiry.The president began his day on Twitter swinging at Vindman an active-duty Army lieutenant colonel who was awarded a Purple Heart after being wounded in Iraq saying he had 'never heard of' him but insisting he is a 'Never Trumper.'The White House also ordered the officer not to testify prompting the House Intelligence Committee to issue a subpoena directing him to give evidence.Vindman who is the National Security Council's senior Ukraine expert testified that he twice raised concerns over the Trump administration's interest in having Ukraine investigate Joe Biden and his son. He is the first White House official to say he heard the July 25 telephone call between Trump and Zelensky that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry. House Republican conference chair Rep. Liz Cheney blasted 'shameful' questioning of Vindman's patriotism after attacks from Trump allies.Cheney a Wyoming Republican and the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney issued her public admonition hours after high-profile conservative commentators sought to discredit Vindman before his testimony – with a former top Bush administration comparing him to a spy.   'I also want to say a word about something else that's been going on over the last couple of hours and last night which I think is also shameful and that is questioning the patriotism questioning the dedication to country of people like Mr. Vindman – Lieutenant Colonel Vindman who will be coming today – and others who have testified' Cheney said at a House leadership press conference.She spoke after former top Bush Administration official John Yoo even compared some of Vindman's activities on the National Security Council to 'espionage.'  Former Wisconsin GOP Rep. Sean Duffy joined in the attack saying on CNN Tuesday about Vindman: 'It seems very clear that he is incredibly concerned about Ukrainian defense. I don't know that he's concerned about American policy ... we all have an affinity to our homeland where we came from ... he has an affinity for the Ukraine.'  Vindman arrived at the Capitol wearing his dress uniform displaying his Purple Heart and a series of other decorations for his service. He was due to tell lawmakers he was a Ukrainian-born Jewish refugee who had lived 'the American dream' by serving his country in combat and as a diplomat.Trump vented just before Lt. Col. Vindman arrived that that a transcript of the call makes it clear he did nothing wrong and that Vindman is an unimportant figure who never crossed paths with him.'Why are people that I never even heard of testifying about the call. Just READ THE CALL TRANSCRIPT AND THE IMPEACHMENT HOAX IS OVER! Ukrain [sic] said NO PRESSURE' Trump tweeted.But calling Vindman a 'Never Trumper' came as pro-Trump pundits were attacked by other Republicans for questioning Lt. Col Vindman's patriotism with one Fox News commentator going as far as to accuse him of 'espionage' against the president.The officer was to testify that he is explicitly not the anonymous whistle-blower whose complaint about the call launched a now weeks-long chapter in the impeachment saga.SCROLL DOWN TO READ LT. COL VINDMAN'S FULL OPENING STATEMENT 'The Impeachment Hoax is a disgrace. Read the transcript!' Trump added in another message. Trump used the same 'never Trumper' insult to go after career diplomat William Taylor who said in his own deposition that the was troubled by the administration's push to get Ukraine to make public statements about investigations that would help the president in order to get military aid and a White House meeting.Zelensky has said he felt no pressure on the call with Trump to take action. The transcript doesn't appear to support Democrats' contention that Trump directly linked U.S. military aid to Ukraine with Zelensky's decision on launching an investigation that could give the president a political advantage in 2020.Trump followed up his social media outrage with a string of retweets of congressional allies calling the entire impeachment inquiry illegitimate because of its secretive and one-sided beginning. In his opening statement first published by The New York Times Vindman claimed the National Security Council proposed that Trump call President Zelensky to congratulate him after his party won parliamentary elections. He explained: 'On July 25 2019 the call occurred. I listened in on the call in the Situation Room with colleagues from the NSC and the office of the Vice President. 'As the transcript is in the public record we are all aware of what was said. I was concerned by the call. I did not think it was proper to demand that a foreign government investigate a U.S. citizen and I was worried about the implications for the U.S. government's support of Ukraine.'I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained.'Burisma Holdings is the Ukrainian energy company where Biden's son Hunter held a lucrative board seat while his father was vice president. 'I realized that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the Bidens and Burisma it would likely be interpreted as a partisan play which would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing the bipartisan support it has thus far maintained.  Vindman claimed: 'This would all undermine U.S. national security. Following the call I again reported my concerns to NSC's lead counsel.'The New York Times reported that Vindman is due to be interviewed privately on Tuesday by the House Intelligence Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform Committees.Vindman served multiple overseas tours including South Korea and Germany and was deployed to Iraq for combat operations. He was wounded in an IED attack and was subsequently awarded a Purple Heart. He served in United States' embassies in Kiev Ukraine and Moscow Russia. In Washington D.C. he was a politico-military affairs officer for Russia for the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff before his appointment to the NSC.
519,Donald Trump challenger Joe Walsh said he could pick a DEMOCRAT as his vice president and wants to rehire Defense Secretary Jim 'Mad Dog' Mattis,Nikki Schwab,The Daily Mail,2,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7616843/Donald-Trump-challenger-Joe-Walsh-said-pick-DEMOCRAT-vice-president.html,"Joe Walsh who is running for president as a Republican in an effort to oust President Trump said he'd consider putting a Democrat on the ticket.   'I think post-Trump it's going to take extraordinary steps to try and unify this country maybe even a Republican presidential nominee and a Democrat vice presidential candidate along with them' Walsh said at Politicon Saturday.Walsh didn't have a dream Dem yet answering 'I don't know yet' when asked for a name but he did say he'd like to see General Jim 'Mad Dog' Mattis Trump's ex-defense secretary back in government. 'I'd love to bring General Mattis back in some important capacity' he told the crowd at Politicon an annual conference being held this year in Nashville Tennessee that attracts both Democrats and Republicans. 'The nice thing Jennifer is there's a deep bench because none of these people wanted to work for Trump' he told moderator Jennifer Rubin who writes opinion pieces for The Washington Post. Walsh is known for being a conservative talk show host and serving one term representing Illinois in the U.S. House of Representatives. He was appearing alongside the two other GOP presidential longshots - former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld and ex-South Carolina governor and Rep. Mark Sanford. Of the three Walsh was the feistiest.  'I don't give a damn how impeachment plays politically"" he said as the trio all agreed Trump should be impeached. They also all said as president they'd prosecute Trump. 'Heck yes' answered Walsh. Walsh called out two GOP senators and former political rivals of the president - Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz - for 'hiding under a stage.' 'They want Trump to use' he said adding that Cruz and Rubio think 'the Republican Party can just go back to what it was.' 'It's too bad they sold their soul to this president' Walsh said. Sanford was asked why so few Republicans have been critical of Trump.  'I don’t think it’s anything more advanced than self-preservation' he said. Sanford was ousted from his House seat after Trump backed his GOP primary challenger. Walsh Sanford and Weld have little hope of beating Trump in part because a number of states including Sanford's South Carolina have cancelled their primaries. Sanford suggested that the Republican Party was doing this to spare Trump any embarrassment.  'I think we ought to see it for what it is' Sanford said. 'It's a sign of weakness.'"
